However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting.

This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents.

Their unobtrusive nature and ability to provide reliable heart rate measurements facilitate the estimation of cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes, as quantified by maximum consumption of oxygen uptake. Previous studies have employed data-driven models which use heart rate information to estimate the cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes. This signifies the physiological relevance of heart rate and heart rate variability for the estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. In this work, the heart rate variability features that were extracted from both exercise and recovery segments were fed to three different Machine Learning models to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of 856 athletes performing Graded Exercise Testing. A total of 101 features from exercise and 30 features from recovery segments were given as input to three feature selection methods to avoid overfitting of the models and to obtain relevant features. This resulted in the increase of model’s accuracy by 5.7% for exercise and 4.3% for recovery. Further, post-modelling analysis was performed to remove the deviant points in two cases, initially in both training and testing and then only in training set, using k-Nearest Neighbour. In the former case, the removal of deviant points led to a reduction of 19.3% and 18.0% in overall estimation error for exercise and recovery, respectively. In the latter case, which mimicked the real-world scenario, the average R value of the models was observed to be 0.72 and 0.70 for exercise and recovery, respectively. From the above experimental approach, the utility of heart rate variability to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of large population of athletes was validated. Additionally, the proposed work contributes to the utility of cardiorespiratory fitness assessment of athletes through wearable heart rate monitors.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,23,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2023-03-01,"Vaishali Balakarthikeyan, Rohan Jais, S.

2019002af81e9c2ec4361890465809ecdd1dabcaae18,201910.1049/ntw2.12098,2019 Evaluating the impact of generative adversarial models on the performance of anomaly intrusion detection,"With the increasing rate and types of cyber attacks against information systems and communication infrastructures, many tools are needed to detect and mitigate against such attacks, for example, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Unfortunately, traditional Signature‐based IDSs (SIDSs) perform poorly against previously unseen adversarial attacks. Anomaly‐based IDSs (AIDSs) use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to overcome these limitations. However, AIDS performance can be poor when trained on imbalanced datasets. To address the challenge of AIDS performance caused by these unbalanced training datasets, generative adversarial models are proposed to obtain adversarial attacks from one side and analyse their quality from another. According to extensive usage and reliability criteria for generative adversarial models in different disciplines, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) are employed to serve AIDS. The authors have extensively assessed their abilities and robustness to deliver high‐quality attacks for AIDS. AIDSs are constructed, trained, and tuned based on these models to measure their impacts. The authors have employed two datasets: NSL‐KDD and CICIDS‐2017 for generalisation purposes, where ML and DL approaches are utilised to implement AIDSs.

Our system uses a dual Doppler radar mounted onto a restroom ceiling and wall. Machine learning methods, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, support vector machine, and random forest methods, are applied to the Doppler radar data to verify the model’s efficiency and features. Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom. These findings indicate that daily restroom monitoring using the proposed radar system accurately recognizes human behaviors and allows early detection of fall accidents.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,22,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2022-02-22,"K.

Validation of the algorithms and outcome measures used by mHealth apps is of paramount importance, as poorly validated apps have been found to be harmful to patients. Falls are a complex, common and costly problem in the older adult population. Deficits in balance and postural control are strongly associated with falls risk. Assessment of balance and falls risk using a validated smartphone app may lessen the need for clinical assessments which can be expensive, requiring non-portable equipment and specialist expertise. This study reports results for the real-world deployment of a smartphone app for self-directed, unsupervised assessment of balance and falls risk. The app relies on a previously validated algorithm for assessment of balance and falls risk; the outcome measures employed were trained prior to deployment on an independent data set. Results for a sample of 594 smartphone assessments from 147 unique phones show a strong association between self-reported falls history and the falls risk and balance impairment scores produced by the app, suggesting they may be clinically useful outcome measures.

However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,21,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-09-01,"S.

This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents. These are the same factors that most studies have used to evaluate the success of an edge-based application. In this review, we first provide an in-depth analysis of the state of the art of AI in edge-based applications with a focus on eight application areas: smart agriculture, smart environment, smart grid, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart education, smart transportation, and security and privacy. Then, we present a qualitative comparison that emphasizes the main objective of the confluence, the roles and the use of artificial intelligence at the network edge, and the key enabling technologies for edge analytics. Then, open challenges, future research directions, and perspectives are identified and discussed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,23,20193dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2023,2023-02-01,"Amira Bourechak, Ouarda Zedadra, M.

In this scenario, overfitting is a major challenge. We investigate a number of techniques to reduce overfitting and improve transfer learning, including regularization techniques such as dropout and L2-regularization towards an out-of-domain prior. In addition, we introduce tuneout, a novel regularization technique inspired by dropout. We apply these techniques, alone and in combination, to neural machine translation, obtaining improvements on IWSLT datasets for English→German and English→Russian. We also investigate the amounts of in-domain training data needed for domain adaptation in NMT, and find a logarithmic relationship between the amount of training data and gain in BLEU score.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,conference,41bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,ArXiv,Unknown,abs/1707.09920,201341bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,2017,2017-07-31,"Antonio Valerio Miceli Barone, B.

001d9b4e71b4031ecf7dd4b7bb6e32ac45102eca,10.3390/s23063251,Heart Rate Variability Based Estimation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake in Athletes Using Supervised Regression Models,"Wearable Heart Rate monitors are used in sports to provide physiological insights into athletes’ well-being and performance. Their unobtrusive nature and ability to provide reliable heart rate measurements facilitate the estimation of cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes, as quantified by maximum consumption of oxygen uptake. Previous studies have employed data-driven models which use heart rate information to estimate the cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes. This signifies the physiological relevance of heart rate and heart rate variability for the estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. In this work, the heart rate variability features that were extracted from both exercise and recovery segments were fed to three different Machine Learning models to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of 856 athletes performing Graded Exercise Testing. A total of 101 features from exercise and 30 features from recovery segments were given as input to three feature selection methods to avoid overfitting of the models and to obtain relevant features. This resulted in the increase of model’s accuracy by 5.7% for exercise and 4.3% for recovery. Further, post-modelling analysis was performed to remove the deviant points in two cases, initially in both training and testing and then only in training set, using k-Nearest Neighbour. In the former case, the removal of deviant points led to a reduction of 19.3% and 18.0% in overall estimation error for exercise and recovery, respectively. In the latter case, which mimicked the real-world scenario, the average R value of the models was observed to be 0.72 and 0.70 for exercise and recovery, respectively. From the above experimental approach, the utility of heart rate variability to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of large population of athletes was validated. Additionally, the proposed work contributes to the utility of cardiorespiratory fitness assessment of athletes through wearable heart rate monitors.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,23,20193dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2023,2023-03-01,"Vaishali Balakarthikeyan, Rohan Jais, S.

Unfortunately, traditional Signature‐based IDSs (SIDSs) perform poorly against previously unseen adversarial attacks. Anomaly‐based IDSs (AIDSs) use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to overcome these limitations. However, AIDS performance can be poor when trained on imbalanced datasets. To address the challenge of AIDS performance caused by these unbalanced training datasets, generative adversarial models are proposed to obtain adversarial attacks from one side and analyse their quality from another. According to extensive usage and reliability criteria for generative adversarial models in different disciplines, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) are employed to serve AIDS. The authors have extensively assessed their abilities and robustness to deliver high‐quality attacks for AIDS. AIDSs are constructed, trained, and tuned based on these models to measure their impacts. The authors have employed two datasets: NSL‐KDD and CICIDS‐2017 for generalisation purposes, where ML and DL approaches are utilised to implement AIDSs. Their results show that the WGAN model outperformed GANs and BiGAN models in binary and multiclass classifications for both datasets.",IET Networks,conference,22af107a-3e64-455e-92c6-82141a5a7e6a,IET Networks,28-44,13,201922af107a-3e64-455e-92c6-82141a5a7e6a,2023,2023-08-28,"Mohammad Arafah, Iain W.

Our system uses a dual Doppler radar mounted onto a restroom ceiling and wall. Machine learning methods, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, support vector machine, and random forest methods, are applied to the Doppler radar data to verify the model’s efficiency and features. Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom. These findings indicate that daily restroom monitoring using the proposed radar system accurately recognizes human behaviors and allows early detection of fall accidents.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,22,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-02-22,"K.

While the field is innovative, the access to cutting-edge technology is limited with reference to the global population. A significant way to improve overall healthcare is to understand the needs and possibilities of all possible consumers when developing sophisticated and accurate medical devices. The Smartphone-based Keratograph (SBK), is an example of a new project that uses real world feedback, addresses an unmet medical need, and implements commercially available components to create a device that is affordable, portable and simplistic to operate. The long-term goal of the SBK is to collect data from users for supervised machine-learning. This machine-learning aspect will ultimately aid in the development of an artificial intelligence device to enable even earlier detection of keratoconus, especially in children and adolescents. Again, the ultimate goal of any medical device should be to improve patient care, and to make a significant improvement on vision healthcare for the global population, providing access to this technology is essential.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,22,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-02-01,"Nikki L.

Among the various types of plastics, polypropylene (PP) emerges as the most extensively used, making it indispensable for the country's plastic industry. This research focuses on presenting and comparing forecasting models for the price of PP granules in Thailand. The primary objective is to identify the most accurate forecasting model, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) serving as the criterion for assessing the forecast model's performance. Three machine learning forecasting models, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are employed in the study. The findings reveal that the ANN model demonstrates the highest accuracy, achieving a MAPE of 5.89% on the test dataset.",International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Systems,conference,71b66afc-2aea-4b7b-89db-e557353969f6,Proceedings of the 2023 6th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Systems,Unknown,Unknown,201971b66afc-2aea-4b7b-89db-e557353969f6,2023,2023-11-25,"Nantachai Kantanantha, Pattarapol Pattaraumpornchai","16686130, 2289498538",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e92652f88ef316ad3ba85bf37705716593e40,"Business, Computer Science, Engineering, Materials Science",16686130,"['Book', 'JournalArticle']",1.0,30.0

Validation of the algorithms and outcome measures used by mHealth apps is of paramount importance, as poorly validated apps have been found to be harmful to patients. Falls are a complex, common and costly problem in the older adult population. Deficits in balance and postural control are strongly associated with falls risk. Assessment of balance and falls risk using a validated smartphone app may lessen the need for clinical assessments which can be expensive, requiring non-portable equipment and specialist expertise. This study reports results for the real-world deployment of a smartphone app for self-directed, unsupervised assessment of balance and falls risk. The app relies on a previously validated algorithm for assessment of balance and falls risk; the outcome measures employed were trained prior to deployment on an independent data set. Results for a sample of 594 smartphone assessments from 147 unique phones show a strong association between self-reported falls history and the falls risk and balance impairment scores produced by the app, suggesting they may be clinically useful outcome measures. In addition, analysis of the quantitative balance features produced seems to suggest that unsupervised, self-directed assessment of balance in the home is feasible.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,21,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-07-01,"B.

So it can get the solution fastly. However, the learning time of ELM is mainly spent on calculating the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse matrices of the hidden layer output matrix. This paper mainly focuses on the effective computation of the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse matrices for ELM. Moreover, several methods are proposed, which are tensor product matrix ELM (TPM-ELM), Geninv ELM Numerical experiments show that both Geninv-ELM and TPM-ELM are faster than other kinds of ELM and can reach comparable generalization performance.",International Conference on Intelligent Computing,conference,47e4f61e-9b0e-431f-bd17-e534b53c655b,,55-61,,201547e4f61e-9b0e-431f-bd17-e534b53c655b,2015,2015-09-01 00:00:00,"Tao Dou, Xu Zhou","2076203091, 48667429",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac43fbcd9d11d392e7b72baaec3c3b934ae32609,"Computer Science, Mathematics",2076203091,,3.0,14.0

Occurrences and numbers of insects can be monitored through insect traps, which include their permanent touring and checking of their condition. Another more efficient way is to set up sensor devices with a camera at the traps that will photograph the traps and forward the images to the Internet, where the pest insect’s appearance will be predicted by image analysis. Weather conditions, temperature and relative humidity are the parameters that affect the appearance of some pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera. This paper presents a model of machine learning that can predict the appearance of insects during a season on a daily basis, taking into account the air temperature and relative humidity. Several machine learning algorithms for classification were applied and their accuracy for the prediction of insect occurrence was presented (up to 76.5%). Since the data used for testing were given in chronological order according to the days when the measurement was performed, the existing model was expanded to take into account the periods of three and five days. The extended method showed better accuracy of prediction and a lower percentage of false detections. In the case of a period of five days, the accuracy of the affected detections was 86.3%, while the percentage of false detections was 11%. The proposed model of machine learning can help farmers to detect the occurrence of pests and save the time and resources needed to check the fields.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,"D.

However, the most common methods to assess aroma are based on expensive equipment or human senses through sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and requires highly trained assessors to avoid subjectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the coffee intensity and aromas using a low-cost and portable electronic nose (e-nose) and machine learning modeling. For this purpose, triplicates of nine commercial coffee samples with different intensity levels were used for this study. Two machine learning models were developed based on artificial neural networks using the data from the e-nose as inputs to (i) classify the samples into low, medium, and high-intensity (Model 1) and (ii) to predict the relative abundance of 45 different aromas (Model 2). Results showed that it is possible to estimate the intensity of coffees with high accuracy (98%; Model 1), as well as to predict the specific aromas obtaining a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99), and no under- or over-fitting of the models were detected. The proposed contactless, nondestructive, rapid, reliable, and low-cost method showed to be effective in evaluating volatile compounds in coffee, which is a potential technique to be applied within all stages of the production process to detect any undesirable characteristics on–time and ensure high-quality products.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-03-01 00:00:00,"Claudia Gonzalez Viejo, E.

The outcome prediction is a difficult task because there are a lot of factors that can afflict the final results and most of them are related to the player human behaviour. In this paper we propose a new feature set (related to the match and to players) aimed to model a soccer match. The set is related to characteristics obtainable not only at the end of the match, but also when the match is in progress. We consider machine learning techniques to predict the results of the match and the number of goals, evaluating a dataset of real-world data obtained from the Italian Serie A league in the 2017-2018 season. Using the RandomForest algorithm we obtain a precision of 0.857 and a recall of 0.750 in won match prediction, while for the goal prediction we obtain a precision of 0.879 in the number of goal prediction less than two, and a precision of 0.8 in the number of goal prediction equal or greater to two.",International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence,conference,f6b96a8f-dc43-4d21-99cf-0f2532b7f01f,,458-465,,2019f6b96a8f-dc43-4d21-99cf-0f2532b7f01f,2019,2019-02-19 00:00:00,"Giovanni Capobianco, Umberto Di Giacomo, F.

Unfortunately, current deep networks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge devices, but also too large for communicating updates over bandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and experimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse Training (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained with substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and in-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that extracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this scheme, ""two birds are killed with one stone:'' instead of full models, each client performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse networks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly accommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse masks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an ""in-time self-ensembling effect'' into the training dynamics, and improves the FL performance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d. FL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our experiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it gains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same upload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2 times the upload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

However, the post-processing of binarization is essential for segmentation-based detection, which converts probability maps produced by a segmentation method into bounding boxes/regions of text. In this paper, we propose a module named Differentiable Binarization (DB), which can perform the binarization process in a segmentation network. Optimized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can adaptively set the thresholds for binarization, which not only simplifies the post-processing but also enhances the performance of text detection. Based on a simple segmentation network, we validate the performance improvements of DB on five benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and speed. In particular, with a light-weight backbone, the performance improvements by DB are significant so that we can look for an ideal tradeoff between detection accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, with a backbone of ResNet-18, our detector achieves an F-measure of 82.8, running at 62 FPS, on the MSRA-TD500 dataset.

However, optimal IRT calibration methods have not been established and the clinical performance of these devices relative to the more common non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) remains unclear. In addition to confirming the findings of our preliminary analysis of clinical study results, the primary intent of this study was to compare methods for IRT calibration and identify best practices for assessing the performance of IRTs intended to detect EBT. A key secondary aim was to compare IRT clinical accuracy to that of NCITs. We performed a clinical thermographic imaging study of more than 1000 subjects, acquiring temperature data from several facial locations that, along with reference oral temperatures, were used to calibrate two IRT systems based on seven different regression methods. Oral temperatures imputed from facial data were used to evaluate IRT clinical accuracy based on metrics such as clinical bias (Δcb), repeatability, root-mean-square difference, and sensitivity/specificity. We proposed several calibration approaches designed to account for the non-uniform data density across the temperature range and a constant offset approach tended to show better ability to detect EBT. As in our prior study, inner canthi or full-face maximum temperatures provided the highest clinical accuracy. With an optimal calibration approach, these methods achieved a Δcb between ±0.03 °C with standard deviation (σΔcb) less than 0.3 °C, and sensitivity/specificity between 84% and 94%. Results of forehead-center measurements with NCITs or IRTs indicated reduced performance. An analysis of the complete clinical data set confirms the essential findings of our preliminary evaluation, with minor differences. Our findings provide novel insights into methods and metrics for the clinical accuracy assessment of IRTs. Furthermore, our results indicate that calibration approaches providing the highest clinical accuracy in the 37–38.5 °C range may be most effective for measuring EBT. While device performance depends on many factors, IRTs can provide superior performance to NCITs.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-12-29 00:00:00,"Quanzeng Wang, Yangling Zhou, Pejman Ghassemi, David McBride, J.

However, the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) phenomenon poses a great challenge and has become the technology bottleneck for practical applications of acoustic smartphone indoor localization. Through identifying and discarding the NLOS measurements, the positioning performance can be improved by incorporating only the LOS measurements. In this paper, we focus on identifying NLOS components by characterizing the acoustic channels. Firstly, by analyzing indoor acoustic propagations, the changes of acoustic channel from the line-of-sight (LOS) condition to the NLOS condition are characterized as the difference of channel gain and channel delay between the two propagation scenarios. Then, an efficient approach to estimate relative channel gain and delay based on the cross-correlation method is proposed, which considers the mitigation of the Doppler Effect and reduction of the computational complexity. Nine novel features have been extracted, and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a radial-based function (RBF) kernel is used to realize NLOS identification. The experimental result with an overall 98.9% classification accuracy based on a data set with more than 10 thousand measurements shows that the proposed identification approach and features are effective in acoustic NLOS identification for acoustic indoor localization via a smartphone. In order to further evaluate the performance of the proposed SVM classifier, the performance of an SVM classifier is compared with that of traditional classifiers based on logistic regression (LR) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results also show that a SVM with the RBF kernel function method outperforms others in acoustic NLOS identification.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-03-30 00:00:00,"Lei Zhang, Danjie Huang, Xinheng Wang, C.

To study the robustness of language grounding to adversarial perturbations in machine vision and perception, we propose Show-and-Fool, a novel algorithm for crafting adversarial examples in neural image captioning. The proposed algorithm provides two evaluation approaches, which check if we can mislead neural image captioning systems to output some randomly chosen captions or keywords. Our extensive experiments show that our algorithm can successfully craft visually-similar adversarial examples with randomly targeted captions or keywords, and the adversarial examples can be made highly transferable to other image captioning systems. Consequently, our approach leads to new robustness implications of neural image captioning and novel insights in visual language grounding.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,conference,1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,,2587-2597,,20171e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,2017,2017-12-06 00:00:00,"Hongge Chen, Huan Zhang, Pin-Yu Chen, Jinfeng Yi, Cho-Jui Hsieh","2108270137, 49723481, 153191489, 2882166, 1793529",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96e53b9c4e7ce52b32f090ceb3b069786559a2b7,Computer Science,2108270137,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",128.0,45.0

X-ray security images have strong texture and RGB features as well as the characteristics of background clutter and object overlap, which makes X-ray imaging very different from other real-world imaging methods. To better detect prohibited items in security X-ray images with these characteristics, we propose EM-YOLOv7, which is composed of both an edge feature extractor (EFE) and a material feature extractor (MFE). We used the Soft-WIoU NMS method to solve the problem of object overlap. To better extract features, the attention mechanism CBAM was added to the backbone. According to the results of several experiments on the SIXray dataset, our EM-YOLOv7 method can better complete prohibited-item-detection tasks during security inspection with detection accuracy that is 4% and 0.9% higher than that of YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, respectively, and other SOTA models.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,20233dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2023,2023-10-01 00:00:00,"Bing Jing, Pianzhang Duan, Lu Chen, Yanhui Du","2260413558, 2260493916, 2260797866, 2260598512",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b4c6dfb1244a4e3db4102436de8db579de8ff2a,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2260413558,['JournalArticle'],7.0,40.0

b90b44ae435f87a729913439bde57fb4e7f6a69f,10.3390/s23010272,A New Approach to Optimize SVM for Insulator State Identification Based on Improved PSO Algorithm,"The failure of insulators may seriously threaten the safe operation of the power system, where the state detection of high-voltage insulators is a must for the normal and safe operation of the power system. Based on the data of insulators in aerial images, this work explored an enhanced particle swarm algorithm to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine. A support vector machine model was therefore established for the identification of the normal and defective states of the insulators. This methodology works with the structure minimization principle of SVM and the characteristics of particle swarm fast optimization. First, the aerial insulator image was segmented as a target by way of the seed region growth based on double-layer cascade morphological improvements, and then, HOG features plus GLCM features were extracted as sample data. Finally, an ameliorated PSO-SVM classifier was designed to realize insulator state identification. Comparisons were made between PSO-SVM and conventional machine learning algorithms, SVM and Random Forest, and an optimization algorithm, Gray Wolf Optimization Support Vector Machine (GWO-SVM), and advanced neural network CNN. The experimental results showed that the performance of the algorithm proposed in this paper touched the top level, where the recognition accuracy rate was 92.11%, the precision rate 90%, the recall rate 94.74%, and the F1-score 92.31%.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-12-27 00:00:00,"Lepeng Song, Qingxue Liang, Hui Chen, Hao Hu, Yu Luo, Yanling Luo","3139123, 30562891, 2161727522, 2118879421, 2150627127, 2202922088",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b90b44ae435f87a729913439bde57fb4e7f6a69f,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",3139123,['JournalArticle'],16.0,54.0

Target-side monolingual data plays an important role in boosting fluency for phrase-based statistical machine translation, and we investigate the use of monolingual data for NMT. In contrast to previous work, which combines NMT models with separately trained language models, we note that encoder-decoder NMT architectures already have the capacity to learn the same information as a language model, and we explore strategies to train with monolingual data without changing the neural network architecture. By pairing monolingual training data with an automatic back-translation, we can treat it as additional parallel training data, and we obtain substantial improvements on the WMT 15 task English German (+2.8-3.7 BLEU), and for the low-resourced IWSLT 14 task Turkish->English (+2.1-3.4 BLEU), obtaining new state-of-the-art results.

Previous work addresses the translation of out-of-vocabulary words by backing off to a dictionary. In this paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, making the NMT model capable of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as sequences of subword units. This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,conference,1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,ArXiv,,abs/1508.07909,20151e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,2015,2015-08-31 00:00:00,"Rico Sennrich, B.

Addressing a single dataset alone to build a machine learning model for the identification of heart problems is not practical because each country and hospital has its own data schema, structure, and quality. On this basis, a generic framework has been built for heart problem diagnosis. This framework is a hybrid framework that employs multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques and votes for the best outcome based on a novel voting technique with the intention to remove bias from the model. The framework contains two consequent layers. The first layer contains simultaneous machine learning models running over a given dataset. The second layer consolidates the outputs of the first layer and classifies them as a second classification layer based on novel voting techniques. Prior to the classification process, the framework selects the top features using a proposed feature selection framework. It starts by filtering the columns using multiple feature selection methods and considers the top common features selected. Results from the proposed framework, with 95.6% accuracy, show its superiority over the single machine learning model, classical stacking technique, and traditional voting technique. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate how the prediction probabilities of multiple models can be exploited for the purpose of creating another layer for final output; this step neutralizes any model bias. Another experimental contribution is proving the complete pipeline’s ability to be retrained and used for other datasets collected using different measurements and with different distributions.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,20233dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2023,2023-01-26 00:00:00,"A.

This paper presents a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) self-tuning temperature sensing and control system for efficiently modulating the temperature environment within a multi-module instrument. The smart system ensures that the internal temperature of the instrument converges to a target without the need of a system model, thus making the control robust. The system consists of a fully-connected proportional–integral–derivative (PID) neural network (FCPIDNN) and an on-line self-tuning module. The experimental results show that the presented system can effectively control the internal temperature under various mission scenarios, in particular, it is able to self-reconfigure upon actuator failure. The system provides a new scheme for a complex and time-variant MIMO control system which can be widely applied for the distributed measurement and control of the environment in instruments, integration electronics, and house constructions.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,16,20163dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2016,2016-10-01 00:00:00,"Zhen Zhang, Cheng Ma, Rong Zhu","2118029605, 144970602, 2070270377",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9ecf47e17a8d890884c94eae4995db47a83cf06,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2118029605,['JournalArticle'],6.0,20.0

This result indicates the possibility that BERT networks capture structural information about language. In this work, we provide novel support for this claim by performing a series of experiments to unpack the elements of English language structure learned by BERT. Our findings are fourfold. BERT’s phrasal representation captures the phrase-level information in the lower layers. The intermediate layers of BERT compose a rich hierarchy of linguistic information, starting with surface features at the bottom, syntactic features in the middle followed by semantic features at the top. BERT requires deeper layers while tracking subject-verb agreement to handle long-term dependency problem. Finally, the compositional scheme underlying BERT mimics classical, tree-like structures.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,conference,1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,,3651-3657,,20191e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,2019,2019-07-28 00:00:00,"Ganesh Jawahar, Benoît Sagot, Djamé Seddah","145123979, 68990982, 1679170",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/335613303ebc5eac98de757ed02a56377d99e03a,"Computer Science, Linguistics",145123979,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",1227.0,24.0

For retailers and marketing analysts, such methods can support the understanding of customers' attitudes towards brands, especially to handle crises that cause behavioural changes in customers, including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the increasing adoption of black-box machine learning-based techniques, transparency becomes a need for those stakeholders to understand why a given sentiment is predicted, which is rarely explored for retailers facing social media crises. This study develops an Explainable Sentiment Analysis (XSA) application for Twitter data, and proposes research propositions focused on evaluating such application in a hypothetical crisis management scenario. Particularly, we evaluate, through discussions and a simulated user experiment, the XSA support for understanding customer's needs, as well as if marketing analysts would trust such an application for their decision-making processes. Results illustrate the XSA application can be effective in providing the most important words addressing customers sentiment out of individual tweets, as well as the potential to foster analysts' confidence in such support.

To help in addressing that need, we present Marabou, a framework for verifying deep neural networks. Marabou is an SMT-based tool that can answer queries about a network’s properties by transforming these queries into constraint satisfaction problems. It can accommodate networks with different activation functions and topologies, and it performs high-level reasoning on the network that can curtail the search space and improve performance. It also supports parallel execution to further enhance scalability. Marabou accepts multiple input formats, including protocol buffer files generated by the popular TensorFlow framework for neural networks.

A rigorous approach to observational studies involves collecting data from different sensors to comprehensively capture the situation of the subject. However, this leads to technical difficulties especially if the sensors are from different manufacturers, as multiple data collection tools have to run simultaneously. We present SensorHub, a system that can collect data from various wearable devices from different manufacturers, such as inertial measurement units, portable electrocardiographs, portable electroencephalographs, portable photoplethysmographs, and sensors for electrodermal activity. Additionally, our tool offers the possibility to include ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in studies. Hence, SensorHub enables multimodal sensor data collection under real-world conditions and allows direct user feedback to be collected through questionnaires, enabling studies at home. In a first study with 11 participants, we successfully used SensorHub to record multiple signals with different devices and collected additional information with the help of EMAs. In addition, we evaluated SensorHub’s technical capabilities in several trials with up to 21 participants recording simultaneously using multiple sensors with sampling frequencies as high as 1000 Hz. We could show that although there is a theoretical limitation to the transmissible data rate, in practice this limitation is not an issue and data loss is rare. We conclude that with modern communication protocols and with the increasingly powerful smartphones and wearables, a system like our SensorHub establishes an interoperability framework to adequately combine consumer-grade sensing hardware which enables observational studies in real life.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,"Jonas Chromik, Kristina Kirsten, Arne Herdick, A.

This study aims to propose a method to classify the user’s gestures without the need of an additional input device to improve the user interface. The smartwatch is equipped with an accelerometer, which collects the data and learns and classifies the gesture pattern using a machine learning algorithm. By incorporating the convolution neural network (CNN) model, the proposed pattern recognition system has become more accurate than the existing model.

In this paper, we present printed sensor antennas for the [862–928] MHz band supporting LoRa and Sigfox and the [2.4–2.5] GHz band for WiFi, Bluetooth, and IEEE802.15.4 communication. To integrate them into smart suitcases, the antennas are printed, overmolded, tested, and measured, following a dedicated conformal integration strategy consisting of two design iterations. Additionally, as a more convenient connection to the printed antennas, printed transmission lines along with a dedicated transition to printed circuit board technologies are implemented and characterized, avoiding rigid coaxial connectors that exhibit fragile mounting on flexible substrates. The overmolded stand-alone antennas achieve fractional impedance bandwidths of 26% and 15% covering the [862–928] MHz and [2.4–2.5] GHz bands, respectively, with a substantial margin and with in-band simulated total efficiencies of 94% and 88%, respectively.

The use of non-verbal cues such as gestures, body movement, and facial expressions convey the feeling and the feedback to the user. This discipline of Human–Computer Interaction places reliance on the algorithmic robustness and the sensitivity of the sensor to ameliorate the recognition. Sensors play a significant role in accurate detection by providing a very high-quality input, hence increasing the efficiency and the reliability of the system. Automatic recognition of human emotions would help in teaching social intelligence in the machines. This paper presents a brief study of the various approaches and the techniques of emotion recognition. The survey covers a succinct review of the databases that are considered as data sets for algorithms detecting the emotions by facial expressions. Later, mixed reality device Microsoft HoloLens (MHL) is introduced for observing emotion recognition in Augmented Reality (AR). A brief introduction of its sensors, their application in emotion recognition and some preliminary results of emotion recognition using MHL are presented. The paper then concludes by comparing results of emotion recognition by the MHL and a regular webcam.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2018,2018-02-01 00:00:00,"Dhwani Mehta, M.

Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG “combo” pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting “clean” PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment. The proposed system has been validated and the results confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2018,2018-01-30 00:00:00,"F.

To date, SPMS studies reported have required many sensors mounted on the backrest plate and seat plate of a chair. The present study, therefore, developed a system that measures a total of six sitting postures including the posture that applied a load to the backrest plate, with four load cells mounted only on the seat plate. Various machine learning algorithms were applied to the body weight ratio measured by the developed SPMS to identify the method that most accurately classified the actual sitting posture of the seated person. After classifying the sitting postures using several classifiers, average and maximum classification rates of 97.20% and 97.94%, respectively, were obtained from nine subjects with a support vector machine using the radial basis function kernel; the results obtained by this classifier showed a statistically significant difference from the results of multiple classifications using other classifiers. The proposed SPMS was able to classify six sitting postures including the posture with loading on the backrest and showed the possibility of classifying the sitting posture even though the number of sensors is reduced.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2018,2018-01-01 00:00:00,"Jongryun Roh, Hyeong-jun Park, Kwang-Jin Lee, Joonho Hyeong, Sayup Kim, Boreom Lee","32238848, 8711360, 2145232511, 31899118, 30143656, 3069730",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1594d211739d2222f2c754a5cb93795aefc05586,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",32238848,['JournalArticle'],92.0,27.0

Although multilingual LMs were also introduced to serve many languages, these have limitations such as being costly at inference time and the size and diversity of non-English data involved in their pre-training. We remedy these issues for a collection of diverse Arabic varieties by introducing two powerful deep bidirectional transformer-based models, ARBERT and MARBERT. To evaluate our models, we also introduce ARLUE, a new benchmark for multi-dialectal Arabic language understanding evaluation. ARLUE is built using 42 datasets targeting six different task clusters, allowing us to offer a series of standardized experiments under rich conditions. When fine-tuned on ARLUE, our models collectively achieve new state-of-the-art results across the majority of tasks (37 out of 48 classification tasks, on the 42 datasets). Our best model acquires the highest ARLUE score (77.40) across all six task clusters, outperforming all other models including XLM-R Large ( 3.4x larger size).

This allows to create multilingual versions from previously monolingual models. The training is based on the idea that a translated sentence should be mapped to the same location in the vector space as the original sentence. We use the original (monolingual) model to generate sentence embeddings for the source language and then train a new system on translated sentences to mimic the original model. Compared to other methods for training multilingual sentence embeddings, this approach has several advantages: It is easy to extend existing models with relatively few samples to new languages, it is easier to ensure desired properties for the vector space, and the hardware requirements for training is lower. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 10 languages from various language families.

The typical mobile-based HRV device simply records interbeat intervals, without differentiation between noise or arrythmia as can be done with an electrocardiogram (ECG). The intent of this report is to validate a new single channel ECG device, the Movesense Medical sensor, against a conventional 12 channel ECG. A heterogeneous group of 21 participants performed an incremental cycling ramp to failure with measurements of HRV, before (PRE), during (EX), and after (POST). Results showed excellent correlations between devices for linear indexes with Pearson’s r between 0.98 to 1.0 for meanRR, SDNN, RMSSD, and 0.95 to 0.97 for the non-linear index DFA a1 during PRE, EX, and POST. There was no significant difference in device specific meanRR during PRE and POST. Bland–Altman analysis showed high agreement between devices (PRE and POST: meanRR bias of 0.0 and 0.4 ms, LOA of 1.9 to −1.8 ms and 2.3 to −1.5; EX: meanRR bias of 11.2 to 6.0 ms; LOA of 29.8 to −7.4 ms during low intensity exercise and 8.5 to 3.5 ms during high intensity exercise). The Movesense Medical device can be used in lieu of a reference ECG for the calculation of HRV with the potential to differentiate noise from atrial fibrillation and represents a significant advance in both a HR and HRV recording device in a chest belt form factor for lab-based or remote field-application.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,"B.

773f1fcbaa6b5752c098766e3423e5ebfc7e4d50,10.3390/s22030993,Deep Learning Empowered Wearable-Based Behavior Recognition for Search and Rescue Dogs,"Search and Rescue (SaR) dogs are important assets in the hands of first responders, as they have the ability to locate the victim even in cases where the vision and or the sound is limited, due to their inherent talents in olfactory and auditory senses. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-assisted implementation incorporating a wearable device, a base station, a mobile application, and a cloud-based infrastructure that can first monitor in real-time the activity, the audio signals, and the location of a SaR dog, and second, recognize and alert the rescuing team whenever the SaR dog spots a victim. For this purpose, we employed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) both for the activity recognition and the sound classification, which are trained using data from inertial sensors, such as 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope and from the wearable’s microphone, respectively. The developed deep learning models were deployed on the wearable device, while the overall proposed implementation was validated in two discrete search and rescue scenarios, managing to successfully spot the victim (i.e., obtained F1-score more than 99%) and inform the rescue team in real-time for both scenarios.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-01-27 00:00:00,"P.

Existing data preparation and analysis systems rely on dictionary lookups and regular expression matching to detect semantic types. However, these matching-based approaches often are not robust to dirty data and only detect a limited number of types. We introduce Sherlock, a multi-input deep neural network for detecting semantic types. We train Sherlock on $686,765$ data columns retrieved from the VizNet corpus by matching $78$ semantic types from DBpedia to column headers. We characterize each matched column with $1,588$ features describing the statistical properties, character distributions, word embeddings, and paragraph vectors of column values. Sherlock achieves a support-weighted F$_1$ score of $0.89$, exceeding that of machine learning baselines, dictionary and regular expression benchmarks, and the consensus of crowdsourced annotations.",Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,conference,a0edb93b-1e95-4128-a295-6b1659149cef,Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining,,,2019a0edb93b-1e95-4128-a295-6b1659149cef,2019,2019-05-25 00:00:00,"Madelon Hulsebos, K.

One of the problems in the utilization of UAVs for agricultural purposes is the limitation in flight time. It is necessary to fly at a high altitude to capture the maximum number of plants in the limited time available, but this reduces the spatial resolution of the captured images. In this study, we applied a super-resolution method to the low-resolution images of tomato diseases to recover detailed appearances, such as lesions on plant organs. We also conducted disease classification using high-resolution, low-resolution, and super-resolution images to evaluate the effectiveness of super-resolution methods in disease classification. Our results indicated that the super-resolution method outperformed conventional image scaling methods in spatial resolution enhancement of tomato disease images. The results of disease classification showed that the accuracy attained was also better by a large margin with super-resolution images than with low-resolution images. These results indicated that our approach not only recovered the information lost in low-resolution images, but also exerted a beneficial influence on further image analysis. The proposed approach will accelerate image-based phenotyping and vigor diagnosis in the field, because it not only saves time to capture images of a crop in a cultivation field but also secures the accuracy of these images for further analysis.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-11-01 00:00:00,"Kyosuke Yamamoto, T.

An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-09-01 00:00:00,"A.

Reflectance indices obtained by an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Spec 4 hyperspectral spectrometer from tomato growth in two soil texture types exposed to four water stress levels (70–100% FC, 60–70% FC, 50–60% FC, and 40–50% FC) was deployed to schedule irrigation and management of crops’ water stress. The treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in a 2 × 4 factorial experiment. Water stress treatments were monitored with Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) every 12 h before and after irrigation to maintain soil water content at the desired (FC%). Soil electrical conductivity (Ec) was measured daily throughout the growth cycle of tomatoes in both soil types. Ec was revealing a strong correlation with water stress at R2 above 0.95 p < 0.001. Yield was measured at the end of the end of the growing season. The results revealed that yield had a high correlation with water stress at R2 = 0.9758 and 0.9816 p < 0.01 for sandy loam and silty loam soils, respectively. Leaf temperature (LT °C), relative leaf water content (RLWC), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), Leaf area index (LAI), were measured at each growth stage at the same time spectral reflectance data were measured throughout the growth period. Spectral reflectance indices used were grouped into three: (1) greenness vegetative indices; (2) water overtone vegetation indices; (3) Photochemical Reflectance Index centered at 570 nm (PRI570), and normalized PRI (PRInorm). These reflectance indices were strongly correlated with all four water stress indicators and yield. The results revealed that NDVI, RDVI, WI, NDWI, NDWI1640, PRI570, and PRInorm were the most sensitive indices for estimating crop water stress at each growth stage in both sandy loam and silty loam soils at R2 above 0.35. This study recounts the depth of 858 to 1640 nm band absorption to water stress estimation, comparing it to other band depths to give an insight into the usefulness of ground-based hyperspectral reflectance indices for assessing crop water stress at different growth stages in different soil types.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-08-24 00:00:00,"K.

In the first part of the paper, we present a general taxonomy of the different defects that fall in two classes: visible (e.g., scratches, shape error, etc.) and palpable (e.g., crack, bump, etc.) defects. Then, we describe artificial visual processing techniques that are aimed at understanding of the captured scenery in a mathematical/logical way. We continue with a survey of textural defect detection based on statistical, structural and other approaches. Finally, we report the state of the art for approaching the detection and classification of defects through supervised and non-supervised classifiers and deep learning.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,20,20203dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2020,2020-03-01 00:00:00,"Tamás Czimmermann, G.

An EDSS measurement contains an overall ‘EDSS’ score and several functional subscores. Typically, expert knowledge is required to interpret consult notes and generate these scores. Previous approaches used limited context length Word2Vec embeddings and keyword searches to predict scores given a consult note, but often failed when scores were not explicitly stated. In this work, we present MS-BERT, the first publicly available transformer model trained on real clinical data other than MIMIC. Next, we present MSBC, a classifier that applies MS-BERT to generate embeddings and predict EDSS and functional subscores. Lastly, we explore combining MSBC with other models through the use of Snorkel to generate scores for unlabelled consult notes. MSBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on all metrics and prediction tasks and outperforms the models generated from the Snorkel ensemble. We improve Macro-F1 by 0.12 (to 0.88) for predicting EDSS and on average by 0.29 (to 0.63) for predicting functional subscores over previous Word2Vec CNN and rule-based approaches.",Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop,conference,a631cd93-9863-44c8-8dff-9eb3fbf4f83e,ArXiv,,abs/2010.15316,2020a631cd93-9863-44c8-8dff-9eb3fbf4f83e,2020,2020-10-29 00:00:00,"Alister D Costa, Stefan Denkovski, Michal Malyska, S.

These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. Most graph neural networks can be described in terms of message passing, vertex update, and readout functions. In this paper, we represent documents as word co-occurrence networks and propose an application of the message passing framework to NLP, the Message Passing Attention network for Document understanding (MPAD). We also propose several hierarchical variants of MPAD. Experiments conducted on 10 standard text classification datasets show that our architectures are competitive with the state-of-the-art. Ablation studies reveal further insights about the impact of the different components on performance.

Over a long period, in the railway operation and maintenance process, the railway signaling and communications department has recorded a large amount of unstructured text information about equipment faults in the form of natural language. However, due to irregularities in the recording methods of these data, it is difficult to use directly. In this paper, a method based on natural language processing (NLP) was adopted to analyze and classify this information. First, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was used to extract the semantic features of the text, which were then expressed in the corresponding topic feature space. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to construct a signal equipment fault diagnostic model that reduced the impact of sample data imbalance on the classification accuracy. This was compared and analyzed with the traditional Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms. This study used signal equipment failure text data from the Lan-Xin high-speed railway to conduct experimental analysis and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments showed that the accuracy of the SVM classification algorithm could reach 0.84 after being combined with the LDA topic model, which verifies that the natural language processing method can effectively realize the fault diagnosis of signal equipment and has certain guiding significance for the maintenance of field signal equipment.",Complex,conference,8bc59e8b-e251-4201-839a-ec83ae78859d,Complex.,9126745:1-9126745:13,2021,20218bc59e8b-e251-4201-839a-ec83ae78859d,2021,2021-07-28 00:00:00,"Lei Shi, Yulin Zhu, Youpeng Zhang, Zhongji Su","2153934130, 2116148860, 145140724, 2051691754",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f254a8ed8c1f3f31d3641db53e21e0e23d670bd,"Computer Science, Engineering",2153934130,['JournalArticle'],11.0,29.0

Traditional physical and chemical analysis methods for green plum acidity detection are destructive, time-consuming, and unable to achieve online detection. In response, a rapid and non-destructive detection method based on hyperspectral imaging technology was studied in this paper. Research on prediction performance comparisons between supervised learning methods and unsupervised learning methods is currently popular. To further improve the accuracy of component prediction, a new hyperspectral imaging system was developed, and the kernel principle component analysis—linear discriminant analysis—extreme gradient boosting algorithm (KPCA-LDA-XGB) model was proposed to predict the acidity of green plum. The KPCA-LDA-XGB model is a supervised learning model combined with the extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental results proved that the KPCA-LDA-XGB model offers good acidity predictions for green plum, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.829 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.107 for the prediction set. Compared with the basic XGBoost model, the KPCA-LDA-XGB model showed a 79.4% increase in R and a 31.2% decrease in RMSE. The use of linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial (Poly) kernel functions were also compared and analyzed in this paper to further optimize the KPCA-LDA-XGB model.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-01-30 00:00:00,"Yang Liu, Honghong Wang, Yeqi Fei, Ying Liu, Luxiang Shen, Zilong Zhuang, Xiao Zhang","2152798461, 2109566038, 2045203822, 2155355726, 2047977872, 123728233, 2115476556",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/034d860700ee788ff8d5513b5c6a80da66968b4a,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science, Medicine",2152798461,['JournalArticle'],22.0,22.0

However, for conscious individuals, traditional cuff-based BP monitoring devices are often uncomfortable, intermittent, and impractical for frequent measurements. Continuous and non-invasive BP (NIBP) monitoring is currently gaining attention in the human health monitoring area due to its promising potentials in assessing the health status of an individual, enabled by machine learning (ML), for various purposes such as early prediction of disease and intervention treatment. This review presents the development of a non-invasive BP measuring tool called sphygmomanometer in brief, summarizes state-of-the-art NIBP sensors, and identifies extended works on continuous NIBP monitoring using commercial devices. Moreover, the NIBP predictive techniques including pulse arrival time, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, and ML are elaborated on the basis of bio-signals acquisition from these sensors. Additionally, the different BP values (systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure) of the various ML models adopted in several reported studies are compared in terms of the international validation standards developed by the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) for clinically-approved BP monitors. Finally, several challenges and possible solutions for the implementation and realization of continuous NIBP technology are addressed.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,"Siti Nor Ashikin Ismail, Nazrul Anuar, R.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) protect networks by using patterns to detect malicious traffic. As attackers have tried to dissimulate traffic in order to evade the rules applied, several machine learning-based IDSs have been developed. In this study, we focused on one such model involving several algorithms and used the NSL-KDD dataset as a benchmark to train and evaluate its performance. We demonstrate a way to create adversarial instances of network traffic that can be used to evade detection by a machine learning-based IDS. Moreover, this traffic can be used for training in order to improve performance in the case of new attacks. Thus, a generative adversarial network (GAN)—i.e., an architecture based on a deep-learning algorithm capable of creating generative models—was implemented.

This health status is determined by the apparent decline of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs). Detecting ADLs provides possibilities of improving the home life of elderly people as it can be applied to fall detection systems. This paper presents fall detection in elderly people based on radar image classification by examining their daily routine activities, using radar data that were previously collected for 99 volunteers. Machine learning techniques are used classify six human activities, namely walking, sitting, standing, picking up objects, drinking water and fall events. Different machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, long short-term memory, bi-directional long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks, were used for data classification. To obtain optimum results, we applied data processing techniques, such as principal component analysis and data augmentation, to the available radar images. The aim of this paper is to improve upon the results achieved using a publicly available dataset to further improve upon research of fall detection systems. It was found out that the best results were obtained using the CNN algorithm with principal component analysis and data augmentation together to obtain a result of 95.30% accuracy. The results also demonstrated that principal component analysis was most beneficial when the training data were expanded by augmentation of the available data. The results of our proposed approach, in comparison to the state of the art, have shown the highest accuracy.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,"William Taylor, K.

As such, fall detection is a crucial topic. However, due to the trade-off relationship between privacy preservation, user convenience, and fall detection performance, it is generally difficult to develop a fall detection system that simultaneously satisfies all conditions. The main goal of this study is to build a practical fall detection framework that can effectively classify the various behavior types into “Fall” and “Activities of daily living (ADL)” while securing privacy preservation and user convenience. For this purpose, signal data containing the motion information of objects was collected using a non-contact, unobtrusive, and non-restraint impulse-radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) radar. These data were then applied to a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to create an object behavior type classifier that can classify the behavior types of objects into “Fall” and “ADL.” The data were collected by actually performing various activities of daily living, including falling. The performance of the classifier yielded satisfactory results. By combining an IR-UWB and CNN algorithm, this study demonstrates the feasibility of building a practical fall detection system that exceeds a certain level of detection accuracy while also ensuring privacy preservation and user convenience.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,20,20203dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2020,2020-10-01 00:00:00,"Taekjin Han, Wonho Kang, Gyunghyun Choi","51065789, 2003575050, 2057605593",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a9a0b22f131c996dc9cf1e24046d79a8f9d9ba,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",51065789,['JournalArticle'],31.0,56.0

First, the traditional radar frequency band is difficult to meet the requirements of fine identification with due to its low carrier frequency and limited micro-Doppler resolution. Another significant problem is that radar signal processing is relatively complex, and the existing signal processing algorithms are poor in real-time usability, robustness and universality. This paper focuses on the two basic problems of human gait detection with radar and proposes a human gait classification and recognition method based on millimeter-wave array radar. Based on deep-learning technology, a multi-channel three-dimensional convolution neural network is proposed on the basis of improving the residual network, which completes the classification and recognition of human gait through the hierarchical extraction and fusion of multi-dimensional features. Taking the three-dimensional coordinates, motion speed and intensity of strong scattering points in the process of target motion as network inputs, multi-channel convolution is used to extract motion features, and the classification and recognition of typical daily actions are completed. The experimental results show that we have more than 92.5% recognition accuracy for common gait categories such as jogging and normal walking.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,20,20203dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2020,2020-09-23 00:00:00,"Xinrui Jiang, Ye Zhang, Qi Yang, B.

The majority of current research relies on feature-ready datasets that heavily depend on feature engineering. Conversely, the increasing complexity of network traffic and the ongoing evolution of attack techniques lead to a diminishing distinction between benign and malicious network behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end intrusion detection framework based on a contrastive learning approach. We design a hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to facilitate the automated extraction of spatiotemporal features from raw traffic data. The integration of contrastive learning amplifies the distinction between benign and malicious network traffic in the representation space. The proposed method exhibits enhanced detection capabilities for unknown attacks in comparison to the approaches trained using the cross-entropy loss function. Experiments are carried out on the public datasets CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, demonstrating that our method can attain a detection accuracy of 99.9% for known attacks, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance.

The effectiveness of a wearable FDS must be contrasted against a wide variety of measurements obtained from inertial sensors during the occurrence of falls and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). In this regard, the access to public databases constitutes the basis for an open and systematic assessment of fall detection techniques. This paper reviews and appraises twelve existing available data repositories containing measurements of ADLs and emulated falls envisaged for the evaluation of fall detection algorithms in wearable FDSs. The analysis of the found datasets is performed in a comprehensive way, taking into account the multiple factors involved in the definition of the testbeds deployed for the generation of the mobility samples. The study of the traces brings to light the lack of a common experimental benchmarking procedure and, consequently, the large heterogeneity of the datasets from a number of perspectives (length and number of samples, typology of the emulated falls and ADLs, characteristics of the test subjects, features and positions of the sensors, etc.). Concerning this, the statistical analysis of the samples reveals the impact of the sensor range on the reliability of the traces. In addition, the study evidences the importance of the selection of the ADLs and the need of categorizing the ADLs depending on the intensity of the movements in order to evaluate the capability of a certain detection algorithm to discriminate falls from ADLs.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-06-27 00:00:00,"E.

However, there are few publicly available datasets, all recorded with smartphones, which are insufficient for testing new proposals due to their absence of objective population, lack of performed activities, and limited information. Here, we present a dataset of falls and activities of daily living (ADLs) acquired with a self-developed device composed of two types of accelerometer and one gyroscope. It consists of 19 ADLs and 15 fall types performed by 23 young adults, 15 ADL types performed by 14 healthy and independent participants over 62 years old, and data from one participant of 60 years old that performed all ADLs and falls. These activities were selected based on a survey and a literature analysis. We test the dataset with widely used feature extraction and a simple to implement threshold based classification, achieving up to 96% of accuracy in fall detection. An individual activity analysis demonstrates that most errors coincide in a few number of activities where new approaches could be focused. Finally, validation tests with elderly people significantly reduced the fall detection performance of the tested features.

The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern of their dependability and reliability. Similar to traditional decision-making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to be repaired. The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security concerns or unjust societal impacts. In this work, we address the problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to construct a neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting the given neural network's parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically, we propose CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a causality-based neural network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault localization to identify the ‘guilty’ neurons and 2) optimizes the parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior. We have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE successfully improves fairness by 61.91 % on average. For backdoor removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over 98% to less than 1 %. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation rate to less than 1 %. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based fault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of the neural networks.",International Conference on Software Engineering,conference,a36dc29e-4ea1-4567-b0fe-1c06daf8bee8,2022 IEEE/ACM 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),338-349,,2022a36dc29e-4ea1-4567-b0fe-1c06daf8bee8,2022,2022-04-20 00:00:00,"Bing-Jie Sun, Jun Sun, Hong Long Pham, Jie Shi","153182156, 2111628876, 2162960923, 2112364113",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cb0bd9f5927403bf29c3b9ccd25a79daac55194,Computer Science,153182156,"['JournalArticle', 'Book', 'Conference']",73.0,70.0

Apart from the robustness and safety, fairness is also an important property that a well-designed DL system should have. To evaluate and improve individual fairness of a model, systematic test case generation for identifying individual discriminatory instances in the input space is essential. In this paper, we propose a framework EIDIG for efficiently discovering individual fairness violation. Our technique combines a global generation phase for rapidly generating a set of diverse discriminatory seeds with a local generation phase for generating as many individual discriminatory instances as possible around these seeds under the guidance of the gradient of the model output. In each phase, prior information at successive iterations is fully exploited to accelerate convergence of iterative optimization or reduce frequency of gradient calculation. Our experimental results show that, on average, our approach EIDIG generates 19.11% more individual discriminatory instances with a speedup of 121.49% when compared with the state-of-the-art method and mitigates individual discrimination by 80.03% with a limited accuracy loss after retraining.",International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis,conference,289bfdda-eab3-4c9a-97be-ef1e0f9ddfc0,Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis,,,2021289bfdda-eab3-4c9a-97be-ef1e0f9ddfc0,2021,2021-07-11 00:00:00,"Lingfeng Zhang, Yueling Zhang, M.

Similar to the 2015 task, the goal of the shared task is to identify individual discourse relations that are present in natural language text. Given a natural language text, participating teams are asked to locate the discourse connectives (explicit or implicit) and their arguments as well as predicting the sense of the discourse connectives. Based on the success of the previous year, we continued to ask participants to deploy their systems on TIRA, a web-based platform on which participants can run their systems on the test data for evaluation. This evaluation methodology preserves the integrity of the shared task. We have also made a few changes and additions in the 2016 shared task based on the feedback from 2015. The first is that teams could choose to carry out the task on Chinese texts, or English texts, or both. We have also allowed participants to focus on parts of the shared task (rather than the whole thing) as a typical system requires substantial investment of effort. Finally, we have modified the scorer so that it can report results based on partial matches of the arguments. 23 teams participated in this year’s shared task, using a wide variety of approaches. In this overview paper, we present the task definition, the training and test sets, and the evaluation protocol and metric used during this shared task. We also summarize the different approaches adopted by the participating teams, and present the evaluation results.

However, there are important linguistic differences between explicit and implicit discourse relations, which limit the accuracy of such an approach. We account for these differences by applying techniques from domain adaptation, treating implicitly and explicitly-marked discourse relations as separate domains. The distribution of surface features varies across these two domains, so we apply a marginalized denoising autoencoder to induce a dense, domain-general representation. The label distribution is also domain-specific, so we apply a resampling technique that is similar to instance weighting. In combination with a set of automatically-labeled data, these improvements eliminate more than 80% of the transfer loss incurred by training an implicit discourse relation classifier on explicitly-marked discourse relations.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,conference,41bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,,2219-2224,,201541bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,2015,2015-09-01 00:00:00,"Yangfeng Ji, Gongbo Zhang, Jacob Eisenstein","40608686, 2115982376, 144154709",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b8d7847251fa73e78e0cad9ef78e25490345539,"Computer Science, Linguistics, Mathematics",40608686,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",30.0,25.0

Instead of depending on mostly hand-engineered sparse features and independent components for each subtask, we propose a unified approach completely based on deep learning architectures. To train more expressive representations that capture communicative functions and semantic roles of discourse units and relations between them, we will jointly learn all discourse parsing subtasks at different layers of our architecture and share their intermediate representations.

However, this approach has been less effective at producing competent players in general-sum games or those with more than two players than in two-player, zero-sum games. An appealing alternative is to consider adaptive algorithms that ensure strong performance in hindsight relative to what could have been achieved with modified behavior. This approach also leads to a game-theoretic analysis, but in the correlated play that arises from joint learning dynamics rather than factored agent behavior at equilibrium. We develop and advocate for this hindsight rationality framing of learning in general sequential decision-making settings. To this end, we re-examine mediated equilibrium and deviation types in extensive-form games, thereby gaining a more complete understanding and resolving past misconceptions. We present a set of examples illustrating the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each type of equilibrium in the literature, and prove that no tractable concept subsumes all others. This line of inquiry culminates in the definition of the deviation and equilibrium classes that correspond to algorithms in the counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) family, relating them to all others in the literature. Examining CFR in greater detail further leads to a new recursive definition of rationality in correlated play that extends sequential rationality in a way that naturally applies to hindsight evaluation.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,conference,bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405,ArXiv,,abs/2012.05874,2020bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405,2020,2020-12-10 00:00:00,"Dustin Morrill, Ryan D'Orazio, Reca Sarfati, Marc Lanctot, James Wright, A.

899db02ba28ef2479b5bea3e51627685be5b3865,10.3390/s17112556,Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Human Activity Recognition,"Adopting deep learning methods for human activity recognition has been effective in extracting discriminative features from raw input sequences acquired from body-worn sensors. Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time, typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However, the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result, typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity-recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper, we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional, bidirectional, and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on miscellaneous benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform methods employing conventional machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Additionally, the proposed models yield better performance than other deep learning techniques, such as deep believe networks (DBNs) and CNNs.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-11-01 00:00:00,"Abdulmajid Murad, Jae-Young Pyun","30050286, 1739676",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/899db02ba28ef2479b5bea3e51627685be5b3865,"Computer Science, Medicine",30050286,['JournalArticle'],383.0,33.0

A real-time hand gesture recognition system should aim to develop a user-independent interface with high recognition performance. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show high recognition rates in image classification problems. Due to the unavailability of large labeled image samples in static hand gesture images, it is a challenging task to train deep CNN networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet from scratch. Therefore, inspired by CNN performance, an end-to-end fine-tuning method of a pre-trained CNN model with score-level fusion technique is proposed here to recognize hand gestures in a dataset with a low number of gesture images. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOO CV) and regular CV tests on two benchmark datasets.

To monitor, six volunteers are considered within the age band of 26 ± 3 years, out of which four were male and two were female. Here, the inertial sensor is attached to the rear upper trunk of the body, and a dataset is generated for five different activities performed by the subjects while sitting in the chair in the office. Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) technique and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are jointly used to select feature vectors. The optimized features are fed to machine learning supervised classifiers such as naive Bayes, SVM, and KNN for recognition. Finally, the SVM classifier achieved 99.90% overall accuracy for different human sitting behaviors using an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-10-01 00:00:00,"V.

However, if these deficits are associated with axial rigidity, the functional mobility or health related quality of life (HRQoL), remains unknown. The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between axial ROM and axial rigidity, the functional mobility and HRQoL in patients with mild to moderate PD. Methods: An exploratory study was conducted. Non-probabilistic sampling of consecutive cases was used. Active trunk ROM was assessed by a universal goniometer. A Biodex System isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure the rigidity of the trunk. Functional mobility was determined by the Get Up and Go (GUG) test, and HRQoL was assessed with the PDQ-39 and EuroQol-5D questionnaires. Results: Thirty-six mild to moderate patients with PD were evaluated. Significant correlations were observed between trunk extensors rigidity and trunk flexion and extension ROM. Significant correlations were observed between trunk flexion, extension and rotation ROM and GUG. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between trunk ROM for flexion, extension and rotations (both sides) and PDQ-39 total score. However, these correlations were considered poor. Conclusions: Trunk ROM for flexion and extension movements, measured by a universal goniometer, were correlated with axial extensors rigidity, evaluated by a technological device at 30°/s and 45°/s, and functional mobility. Moreover, trunk ROM for trunk flexion, extension and rotations were correlated with HRQoL in patients with mild to moderate PD.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,20,20203dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2020,2020-04-27 00:00:00,"R.

Transfer learning can bridge between a source domain with rich sample data and a target domain with only a few or zero labeled samples and, thus, complete the transfer of knowledge by aligning the distribution between domains through methods, such as domain adaptation. Previous domain adaptation methods mostly align the features in the feature space of all categories on a global scale. Recently, the method of locally aligning the sub-categories by introducing label information achieved better results. Based on this, we present a deep fuzzy domain adaptation (DFDA) that assigns different weights to samples of the same category in the source and target domains, which enhances the domain adaptive capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DFDA can achieve remarkable results on standard domain adaptation datasets.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,"Fangwen Zhao, Weifeng Liu, Chenglin Wen","2154200573, 46642262, 2115014124",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5212701214090174156c2ad00c113b83b1ceac4c,"Computer Science, Medicine",2154200573,['JournalArticle'],4.0,46.0

However, the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same time, which leads to unsatisfactory results. To mitigate this problem, we propose PairRE, a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. The paired vectors enable an adaptive adjustment of the margin in loss function to fit for different complex relations. Besides, PairRE is capable of encoding three important relation patterns, symmetry/antisymmetry, inverse and composition. Given simple constraints on relation representations, PairRE can encode subrelation further. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities of PairRE. Moreover, We set a new state-of-the-art on two knowledge graph datasets of the challenging Open Graph Benchmark.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,conference,1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,,4360-4369,,20201e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,2020,2020-11-07 00:00:00,"Linlin Chao, Jianshan He, Taifeng Wang, Wei Chu","1850313, 51235263, 1799672, 2057047939",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a8a8504722d9a39f17bbaa2968a89acc5cd0c48,Computer Science,1850313,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",151.0,41.0

Typically based on signal strength measurement, a power level map is created first in the learning phase to align with measured values in the inference. Second, the location is determined by taking the point for which the recorded received power level is closest to the power level actually measured. The biggest limit of this technique is the reliability of power measurements, which may lack accuracy in many wireless systems. To this end, this work extends the power level measurement by using multiple anchors and multiple radio channels and, consequently, considers different approaches to aligning the actual measurements with the recorded values. The dataset is available online. This article focuses on the very popular radio technology Bluetooth Low Energy to explore the possible improvement of the system accuracy through different machine learning approaches. It shows how the accuracy–complexity trade-off influences the possible candidate algorithms on an example of three-channel Bluetooth received signal strength based fingerprinting in a one dimensional environment with four static anchors and in a two dimensional environment with the same set of anchors. We provide a literature survey to identify the machine learning algorithms applied in the literature to show that the studies available can not be compared directly. Then, we implement and analyze the performance of four most popular supervised learning techniques, namely k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. In our scenario, the most promising machine learning technique being the Random Forest with classification accuracy over 99%.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,"L.

9cc547ba0afc77ce1f1acf51e9ef38b2e5b590d4,10.3390/s23010294,An Extended Review Concerning the Relevance of Deep Learning and Privacy Techniques for Data-Driven Soft Sensors,"The continuously increasing number of mobile devices actively being used in the world amounted to approximately 6.8 billion by 2022. Consequently, this implies a substantial increase in the amount of personal data collected, transported, processed, and stored. The authors of this paper designed and implemented an integrated personal health data management system, which considers data-driven software and hardware sensors, comprehensive data privacy techniques, and machine-learning-based algorithmic models. It was determined that there are very few relevant and complete surveys concerning this specific problem. Therefore, the current scientific research was considered, and this paper comprehensively analyzes the importance of deep learning techniques that are applied to the overall management of data collected by data-driven soft sensors. This survey considers aspects that are related to demographics, health and body parameters, and human activity and behaviour pattern detection. Additionally, the relatively complex problem of designing and implementing data privacy mechanisms, while ensuring efficient data access, is also discussed, and the relevant metrics are presented. The paper concludes by presenting the most important open research questions and challenges. The paper provides a comprehensive and thorough scientific literature survey, which is useful for any researcher or practitioner in the scope of data-driven soft sensors and privacy techniques, in relation to the relevant machine-learning-based models.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-12-27 00:00:00,"R.

This paper explores the integration of the Network Slice Controller (NSC) in an IBN context further enhances network management by enabling scalable resource requests, outsourcing resource evaluation, and modular operation of intent processing. However, challenges such as addressing the knapsack problem, obtaining sufficient network information without compromising privacy, and optimizing the process without counterproductive overloads need to be tackled. Overall, IBN holds immense potential in revolutionizing network management in the 5G/6G era, paving the way for personalized and efficient connectivity, and the Network Slice Controller can be a key feature to facilitate the integration of IBN with 5G/6G network controllers.",International Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture,conference,b251b5b7-ceed-428c-9e33-d1b41d4d1cb6,Proceedings of the 18th Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture,,,2023b251b5b7-ceed-428c-9e33-d1b41d4d1cb6,2023,2023-10-02 00:00:00,"Alejandro Muñiz Da Costa, Luis M.

The aim of this work is to review the state-of-the-art literature that adopts this new posturographic paradigm, i.e., to analyse human postural sway through inertial sensors directly worn on the subject body. After a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus databases, two raters evaluated the quality of 73 full-text articles, selecting 47 high-quality contributions. A good inter-rater reliability was obtained (Cohen’s kappa = 0.79). This selection of papers was used to summarize the available knowledge on the types of sensors used and their positioning, the data acquisition protocols and the main applications in this field (e.g., “active aging”, biofeedback-based rehabilitation for fall prevention, and the management of Parkinson’s disease and other balance-related pathologies), as well as the most adopted outcome measures. A critical discussion on the validation of wearable systems against gold standards is also presented.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,19,20193dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2019,2019-09-20 00:00:00,"M.

New terms are coined to summarize new developments, often with several interpretations and without a formal definition. The term Smart Education has been coined to represent a move forward in technology-enhanced education, but what is behind it? Does it represent something essentially different from the educational technologies used before? In this paper, we do a systematic literature review to understand how this term is used, what the technologies behind it are, and what promises are made. We conclude that although the term is fuzzy, there are indeed several developments available today that can make educational technologies much more adapted to the learner and therefore underpin the learning in a smarter way.",International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Ambient Intelligence,conference,05878603-c240-4a32-b893-eda8d45febb4,,57,,201905878603-c240-4a32-b893-eda8d45febb4,2019,2019-11-21 00:00:00,"Adrián Martín, Carlos Alario-Hoyos, C.

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder‐Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,conference,41bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,,1724-1734,,201441bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,2014,2014-06-03 00:00:00,"Kyunghyun Cho, B.

The present study investigated the effects of ultrasonic excitation on the heat transfer rate in a fin-and-flat tube heat exchanger experimentally. The performance of the heat exchanger was investigated with and without the presence of ultrasonic excitation. A comprehensive parameter study was attempted, so several parameters, including ambient temperature, flow rate, air passing velocity, Reynolds number, and Nusselt number, were studied in a relatively wide range. An adequate uncertainty test, as well as a validation assessment, is provided to certify the credibility of the obtained results and the hired facility. The results revealed that reducing the flow rate, ambient temperature, and air passing velocity on the heat exchanger increased the ultrasonic excitation’s effects. The highest heat transfer enhancement in the present experiment was 70.11%, measured at the lowest air passing velocity and ambient temperature with a Reynolds number 2166. The data presented in this paper will be useful for the optimal design of ultrasonic vibrating fin-and-tube heat exchangers.",Fire,conference,a33b4339-8ebd-427d-8a4a-2496fca85732,Fire,,,2022a33b4339-8ebd-427d-8a4a-2496fca85732,2022,2022-12-31 00:00:00,"A.

2a1ec9961acbb14cb769d9ef6bf30124195ccfcb,10.3390/s19020431,A Smart Recommender Based on Hybrid Learning Methods for Personal Well-Being Services,"The main focus of the paper is to propose a smart recommender system based on the methods of hybrid learning for personal well-being services, called a smart recommender system of hybrid learning (SRHL). The essential health factor is considered to be personal lifestyle, with the help of a critical examination of various disciplines. Integrating the recommender system effectively contributes to the prevention of disease, and it also leads to a reduction in treatment cost, which contributes to an improvement in the quality of life. At the same time, there exist various challenges within the recommender system, mainly cold start and scalability. To effectively address the inefficiencies, we propose combined hybrid methods in regard to machine learning. The primary aim of this learning method is to integrate the most effective and efficient learning algorithms to examine how combined hybrid filtering can help to improve the cold star problem efficiently in the provision of personalized well-being in regard to health food service. These methods include: (1) switching among content-based and collaborative filtering; (2) identifying the user context with the integration of dynamic filtering; and (3) learning the profiles with the help of processing and screening of reflecting feedback loops. The experimental results were evaluated by using three absolute error measures, providing comparable results with other studies relative to machine learning domains. The effects of using the hybrid learning method are gathered with the help of the experimental results. Our experiments also show that the hybrid method improves accuracy by 14.61% of the average error predicted in the recommender systems in comparison to the collaborative methods, which mainly focus on the computation of similar entities.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,19,20193dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2019,2019-01-01 00:00:00,"Rayan M.

Current technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes IoT-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an IoT-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of IoT-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that IoT-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input. The proposed system is expected to support management by improving decision-making and will help prevent unexpected losses caused by faults during the manufacturing process.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2018,2018-09-01 00:00:00,"Muhammad Syafrudin, Ganjar Alfian, Norma Latif Fitriyani, J.
