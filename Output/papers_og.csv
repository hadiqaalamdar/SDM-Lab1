00000c33779acab142af6c7a6dae8b36fac0805d,10.3390/en17040925,Insights into Household Electric Vehicle Charging Behavior: Analysis and Predictive Modeling,"In the era of burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) popularity, understanding the patterns of EV users’ behavior is imperative. This paper examines the trends in household charging sessions’ timing, duration, and energy consumption by analyzing real-world residential charging data. By leveraging the information collected from each session, a novel framework is introduced for the efficient, real-time prediction of important charging characteristics. Utilizing historical data and user-specific features, machine learning models are trained to predict the connection duration, charging duration, charging demand, and time until the next session. These models enhance the understanding of EV users’ behavior and provide practical tools for optimizing the EV charging infrastructure and effectively managing the charging demand. As the transportation sector becomes increasingly electrified, this work aims to empower stakeholders with insights and reliable models, enabling them to anticipate the localized demand and contribute to the sustainable integration of electric vehicles into the grid.",Energies,journal,['JournalArticle'],1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,2024-02-16,5,34,"Ahmad Almaghrebi, Kevin James, Fares al Juheshi, Mahmoud Alahmad","66925799, 2069468721, 31051246, 2284527869",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00000c33779acab142af6c7a6dae8b36fac0805d,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",66925799

Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” (PAI) reflecting an individual’s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

A potential route to accelerate this process is to employ artificial intelligence methodologies such as machine learning (ML). Herein, the possibility to predict anti‐inflammatory properties of the polymers by using a simplified model of inflammation and a restrained dataset is explored. Cellular assays with 50 different polymers are conducted using the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. These experiments generate a dataset which is used to develop a ML model based on Bayesian logistic regression. After conducting a Bayesian logistic regression analysis, two ML models, K‐nearest neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes, are employed to predict anti‐inflammatory polymers properties. The study finds that the probability of a polymer having anti‐inflammatory properties is multiplied by three if it is a polycation, and that nitric oxide secretion is a good indicator in determining the anti‐inflammatory properties of a polymer, which in this work are defined by tumor necrosis factor alpha expression decrease. Overall, the study suggests that with appropriate dataset design, ML techniques can provide valuable information on functional polymer properties, enabling faster and more efficient biomaterial development.",Advanced NanoBiomed Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],7ba839a3-edbb-4dd0-b241-fd1020910706,Advanced NanoBiomed Research,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,2024-01-08,3,18,"Aghilas Akkache, Lisa Clavier, Oleh Mezhenskyi, Kateryna Andriienkova, Thibaut Soubrié, Philippe Lavalle, N.

GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high TUBA1B expression is closely associated with glioma malignancy and poor prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target.",Frontiers in Oncology,journal,['JournalArticle'],fdeb07d1-a046-4a1a-98aa-167e7f8e667a,Frontiers in Oncology,Unknown,15,N/A,2025,2025-02-28,0,42,"Zesheng Sun, Pengcheng Huang, Jialiang Lin, Guiping Jiang, Jian Chen, Qianqian Liu","2335088745, 2348080160, 2335146575, 2349229052, 2348215666, 2348012936",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d0ebfeb82a9c0fe964bd5ca0811f352883cf,"Biology, Medicine",2335088745

Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 203 patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI before prostate biopsy were included. After manual segmentation, radiomic features (RFs) were extracted from T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, and high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI). Patients were split into training sets and testing sets according to a ratio of 8:2. A pipeline considering combinations of two feature selection (FS) methods and six ML classifiers was developed and evaluated. The performance of models was assessed using the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1-measure, and the area under curve (AUC). Results: On high b-value DWMRI-derived features, a combination of FS method recursive feature elimination (RFE) and classifier random forest achieved the highest performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs, with 97.0% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity, 98.0% precision, and 97.0% F1-measure. The method also achieved an average AUC for GG of 98%. Conclusion: Preoperative mpMRI radiomic analysis based on ML, as a noninvasive approach, showed good performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs. Advances in Knowledge: Herein, radiomic models based on preoperative mpMRI and ML were developed to classify prostate cancer into 5 GGs. Our study provides evidence that analysis of quantitative RFs extracted from high b-value DWMRI images based on a combination of FS method RFE and classifier random forest can be applied for multiclass grading of prostate cancer with an accuracy of 97.0%.",Journal of Medical Signals & Sensors,journal,['JournalArticle'],0295c2a5-dbd7-433c-8310-a1642b68a7b8,Journal of Medical Signals and Sensors,Unknown,14,N/A,2024,2024-12-01,0,45,"Fatemeh Zandie, Mohammad Salehi, A.

This study aims to ascertain differences in the importance features of machine learning models of household disaster preparedness for four groups to inform culturally tailored intervention recommendations for nursing practice. A machine learning model was developed and tested by combining data from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Federal Emergency Management Agency National Household Survey. The primary outcome variable was a composite readiness score. A total of 252 variables from 15,048 participants were included. Over 10% of the sample self-identified as African American/Black and 30.3% reported being 65 years of age or older. Importance features varied regarding financial and insurance preparedness, information seeking and transportation between groups. These results reiterate the need for targeted interventions to support financial resilience and equitable resource access. Notably, older adults with Black racial identities were the only group where TV, TV news, and the Weather Channel was a priority feature for household disaster preparedness. Additionally, reliance on public transportation was most important among older adults with Black racial identities, highlighting priority needs for equity in disaster preparedness and policy.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Unknown,21,N/A,2024,2024-04-23,1,94,"M.

Specifically, if common variants confer growth advantages, they may have undergone positive selection across different patients due to similar selection pressures. Moreover, studies have demonstrated the significance of rare mutations that arise as resistance mechanisms in response to drug treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of both recurrent and rare variants in cancer. In addition to this, most existing tools for variant prediction focus on distinguishing variants found in normal and disease populations, often without considering the specific disease contexts in which these variants arise. Instead, they typically build predictors that generalise across all diseases. Here, we introduce CanDrivR-CS, a set of cancer-specific gradient boosting models designed to distinguish between rare and recurrent cancer variants. Results We curated missense variant data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Cancer-type-specific models significantly outperformed a baseline pan-cancer model, achieving a maximum leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) F1 score of up to 90% for CanDrivRSKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma) and 89% for CanDrivR-SKCA (Skin Adenocarcinoma), compared to 79.2% for the baseline model. Notably, DNA shape properties consistently ranked among the top features for distinguishing recurrent and rare variants across all cancers. Specifically, recurrent missense variants frequently occurred in DNA bends and rolls, potentially implicating regions prone to DNA replication errors and acting as mutational hotspots.

It is very important to establish an accurate prediction model of cyanobacterial bloom concentration, which is a challenging issue. Machine learning techniques can improve the prediction accuracy, but a large amount of historical monitoring data is needed to train these models. For some waters with an inconvenient geographical location or frequent sensor failures, there are not enough historical data to train the model. To deal with this problem, a fused model based on a transfer learning method is proposed in this paper. In this study, the data of water environment with a large amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the source domain in order to learn the knowledge of cyanobacterial bloom growth characteristics and train the prediction model. The data of the water environment with a small amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the target domain in order to load the model trained in the source domain. Then, the training set of the target domain is used to participate in the inter-layer fine-tuning training of the model to obtain the transfer learning model. At last, the transfer learning model is fused with a convolutional neural network to obtain the prediction model. Various experiments are conducted for a 2 h prediction on the test set of the target domain. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of cyanobacterial blooms for the water environment with a low data volume.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2022,2022-04-16,9,56,"J.

However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,21,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-09-01,31,81,"S.

This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents. These are the same factors that most studies have used to evaluate the success of an edge-based application. In this review, we first provide an in-depth analysis of the state of the art of AI in edge-based applications with a focus on eight application areas: smart agriculture, smart environment, smart grid, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart education, smart transportation, and security and privacy. Then, we present a qualitative comparison that emphasizes the main objective of the confluence, the roles and the use of artificial intelligence at the network edge, and the key enabling technologies for edge analytics. Then, open challenges, future research directions, and perspectives are identified and discussed.

Previous studies have targeted particular patient populations with life-limiting disease, but few have focused on patients in a primary care setting. Toward this end, we propose a stepped-wedge pragmatic randomized trial whereby a machine learning algorithm identifies patients empaneled to primary care units at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, United States) with high likelihood of palliative care need. Methods 42 care team units in 9 clusters were randomized to 7 wedges, each lasting 42 days. For care teams in treatment wedges, palliative care specialists review identified patients, making recommendations to primary care providers when appropriate. Care teams in control wedges receive palliative care under the standard of care. Discussion This pragmatic trial therefore integrates machine learning into clinical decision making, instead of simply reporting theoretical predictive performance. Such integration has the possibility to decrease time to palliative care, improving patient quality of life and symptom burden.

High levels and complex patterns of spontaneous activity are generally associated with low rates of apoptosis in the cortex. However, whether spontaneous activity patterns directly encode for survival of individual cortical neurons during development remains an open question. Here, we longitudinally investigated spontaneous activity and apoptosis in developing cortical cultures, combining extracellular electrophysiology with calcium imaging. These experiments demonstrated that the early occurrence of calcium transients was strongly linked to neuronal survival. Silent neurons exhibited a higher probability of cell death, whereas high frequency spiking and burst behavior were almost exclusively detected in surviving neurons. In local neuronal clusters, activity of neighboring neurons exerted a pro-survival effect, whereas on the functional level, networks with a high modular topology were associated with lower cell death rates. Using machine learning algorithms, cell fate of individual neurons was predictable through the integration of spontaneous activity features. Our results indicate that high frequency spiking activity constrains apoptosis in single neurons through sustained calcium rises and thereby consolidates networks in which a high modular topology is reached during early development.",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,journal,['JournalArticle'],5b97da83-0106-4e9f-aef2-4c3006afbb2c,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,Unknown,10,N/A,2022,2022-08-10,13,105,"David Warm, Davide Bassetti, Jonas Schroer, H.

0005652ac7e1bed2163fa6815bb38172fae80525,10.48175/ijarsct-14367,Challenges Faced During Implementation of Digital Twin in Construction Project Monitoring,"Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining popularity because they provide precise digital copies of assets, processes, and systems. This is especially true when these DTs are paired with real-time simulation models that make use of modern technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. These combinations can provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of the monitored systems. Digital twin (DT) has shown tremendous potential to bring about revolutionary improvements in the field of construction site surveillance. There is, however, a notable paucity of empirical research identifying the constant elements affecting DT adoption in this industry. This research tries to fill that void by identifying the important elements that determine the usage of DT in construction. The study adopts a complete framework with the goal of increasing the use of DT in building site monitoring. The elements influencing the adoption and effectiveness of distributed ledger technology (DT) are divided into three categories: technological, organizational, and economic. Technological factors include the system's appropriateness and the robustness of the data infrastructure. Organizational considerations include the company's openness to innovation and leadership support. Economic aspects include things like return on investment (ROI) and cost-effectiveness. The research technique combines case studies and literature reviews to examine the benefits and drawbacks of DT in construction monitoring. This study's expected output is a comprehensive framework that aids construction businesses in optimizing the use of DT in site monitoring. This would allow for more efficient, data-driven, and forward-thinking processes. The study's ultimate purpose is to provide critical knowledge that will assist the building sector in adopting cutting-edge methods. The industry may better plan for the integration of this sophisticated technology into their operations by knowing the potential of DT and the variables driving its adoption.

However, many current studies overlook the relationships between different growth parameters and their varying contributions to yield, leading to overlapping information and lower accuracy in monitoring crop growth. Therefore, this study focuses on winter wheat and constructs a comprehensive growth monitoring index (CGIac), based on adaptive weight allocation of growth parameters’ contribution to yield, using data such as leaf area index (LAI), soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, plant height (PH), biomass (BM), and plant water content (PWC). Using UAV data on vegetation indices, feature selection was performed using the Elastic Net. The growth inversion model was then constructed using machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector regression (SVR). Based on the optimal growth inversion model for winter wheat, spatial distribution of wheat growth in the study area is obtained. The findings demonstrated that CGIac outperforms CGIav (constructed using equal weighting) and CGIcv (built using the coefficient of variation) in yield correlation and prediction accuracy. Specifically, the yield correlation of CGIac improved by up to 0.76 compared to individual indices, while yield prediction accuracy increased by up to 23.14%. Among the evaluated models, the RF model achieved the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.895 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0058. A comparison with wheat orthophotos from the same period confirmed that the inversion results were highly consistent with actual growth conditions in the study area. The proposed method significantly improved the accuracy and applicability of winter wheat growth monitoring, overcoming the limitations of single parameters in growth prediction. Additionally, it provided new technological support and innovative solutions for regional crop monitoring and precision farming operations.",Agriculture,journal,['JournalArticle'],182090fa-e886-41f3-8590-443a006fb02f,Agriculture,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,2024-10-26,0,0,"Lulu Zhang, Xiaowen Wang, Huanhuan Zhang, Bo Zhang, Jin Zhang, Xinkang Hu, Xintong Du, Jianrong Cai, Weidong Jia, Chundu Wu","2328457063, 2181382810, 2328271931, 2295873742, 2328099286, 2328219368, 2328800883, 2329139801, 2319523838, 2267774398",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005a412ddf59452f7c58c49b6060a62d0bba0f1,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Engineering, Environmental Science",2328457063

In this work reactions are labeled with experimental conditions and network analysis shows that consistencies within clusters of data points can be leveraged to organize this information. In particular, this analysis shows how particular experimental conditions (specifically solvent) are effective in enabling specific organic reactions (Friedel-Crafts, Aldol addition, Claisen condensation, Diels-Alder, and Wittig), including variations within each reaction class. An example of network analysis is shown in the graphical abstract, where data points for a Claisen condensation reaction break into clusters that depend on the catalyst and chemical structure. This type of clustering, which mimics how a chemist reasons, is derived directly from the network. Therefore the findings of this work could augment synthesis planning by providing predictions in a fashion that mimics human chemists. To numerically evaluate solvent prediction ability, three methods are compared: network analysis (through the k-nearest neighbor algorithm), a support vector machine, and a deep neural network. The most accurate method in 4 of the 5 test cases is the network analysis, with deep neural networks also showing good prediction scores. The network analysis tool was evaluated by an expert panel of chemists, who generally agreed that the algorithm produced accurate solvent choices while simultaneously being transparent in the underlying reasons for its predictions.",Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f16aef5-6b9f-4f87-baca-cbf8147e352f,Journal of chemical information and modeling,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2019,2019-08-05,36,69,"E.

They are likely to provide many lead structures, which can be used as templates for the construction of novel drugs with enhanced antitumor activity. Traditional research approaches studied structure-activity relationship of natural products and obtained key structural properties, such as chemical bond or group, with the purpose of ascertaining their effect on a single cell line or a single tissue type. Here, for the first time, we develop a machine learning method to comprehensively predict natural products responses against a panel of cancer cell lines based on both the gene expression and the chemical properties of natural products. The results on two datasets, training set and independent test set, show that this proposed method yields significantly better prediction accuracy. In addition, we also demonstrate the predictive power of our proposed method by modeling the cancer cell sensitivity to two natural products, Curcumin and Resveratrol, which indicate that our method can effectively predict the response of cancer cell lines to these two natural products.

This scheduling problem involves strategically managing the limited stored hydro energy in coordination with the electricity system. The scenario fan problem, selected as a long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling approach, can effectively represent the individual hydropower plants and their short‐term flexibility within the long‐term scheduling process, making it well‐suited for capturing the disaggregated physical characteristics of hydro stations. However, the computational burden of scenario fan problem increases due to the complexity of the cascaded system and the large number of inflow scenarios. To tackle these challenges, a machine learning clustering method is developed for extracting shape‐based features to capture the energy and shape attributes of hydro inflows. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing it with four established clustering methods. This evaluation was carried out on a hydro‐thermal test case, utilizing both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample data analysis. The findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other methods in terms of computational time by 42.6% and optimal reservoir trajectories by 12.1% considering K‐means using Euclidean distance as the benchmark. Additionally, this study showcases the feasibility of performing long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling at a granular level, with detailed topological information and a shorter time scale. This expanded approach opens up new possibilities for addressing the integration of renewable energy resources within the realm of long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling.",IET Renewable Power Generation,journal,['JournalArticle'],a96706ed-bd70-4e6e-a2ae-02cae975a5c5,IET Renewable Power Generation,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,2024-03-18,2,34,"Jinghao Wang, Mojtaba Yousefi, Jayaprakash Rajasekharan, Reza Arghandeh, Hossein Farahmand","2292630556, 2300235810, 2693824, 2265326503, 2292512207",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00095fcd109f44eb4556be300e203702f2a05ea1,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",2292630556

In this paper, an energy-efficient control and routing protocol for wireless sensor networks is presented. This algorithm is based on reinforcement learning for energy management in the network. This protocol seeks to optimize routing policies to maximize the long-term reward received by each node, using reinforcement learning, which is a machine learning approach. In order to improve the lifetime of wireless sensor network, three energy management approaches have been proposed. The first approach is to navigate correctly using reinforcement learning to reduce the length of the routes and to improve energy consumption. The second approach is to exploit a sleep scheduling technique to improve node energy consumption. The last approach is used to restrict data transmission of each node based on the received data change rate.

The crucial role of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) gene family in the tumor microenvironment of HCC remains unclear. Methods This study employed a novel multi-omics integration strategy to investigate the potential roles of ADAM family signals in HCC. A series of single-cell and spatial omics algorithms were utilized to uncover the molecular characteristics of ADAM family genes within HCC. The GSVA package was utilized to compute the scores for ADAM family signals, subsequently stratified into three categories: high, medium, and low ADAM signal levels through unsupervised clustering. Furthermore, we developed and rigorously validated an innovative and robust clinical prognosis assessment model by employing 99 mainstream machine learning algorithms in conjunction with co-expression feature spectra of ADAM family genes. To validate our findings, we conducted PCR and IHC experiments to confirm differential expression patterns within the ADAM family genes. Results Gene signals from the ADAM family were notably abundant in endothelial cells, liver cells, and monocyte macrophages. Single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analyses have both revealed the molecular heterogeneity of the ADAM gene family, further emphasizing its significant impact on the development and progression of HCC. In HCC tissues, the expression levels of ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 were markedly elevated. Elevated ADAM family signal scores were linked to adverse clinical outcomes and disruptions in the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming. An ADAM prognosis signal, developed through the utilization of 99 machine learning algorithms, could accurately forecast the survival duration of HCC, achieving an AUC value of approximately 0.9. Conclusions This study represented the inaugural report on the deleterious impact and prognostic significance of ADAM family signals within the tumor microenvironment of HCC.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,Unknown,15,N/A,2024,2024-09-13,5,46,"Junhong Chen, Qihang Yuan, Hewen Guan, Yuying Cui, Chang Fu, Tianfu Wei, Kai Liu","2275569867, 2300545851, 2199526835, 2321189873, 2220447371, 2321489136, 2282140745",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a5d98243250c138efd38742555d600655a9e5,"Biology, Medicine",2275569867

A comprehensive but practical test battery using 5 wearable inertial sensors for multifactorial fall risk assessment was designed. This was followed by an experimental study on 196 community-dwelling Korean older women, categorized as fallers (N1 = 82) and non-fallers (N2 = 114) based on prior history of falls. Six machine learning models (logistic regression, naïve bayes, decision tree, random forest, boosted tree and support vector machine) were proposed for faller classification. Results indicated that compared with non-fallers, fallers performed significantly worse on the test battery. In addition, the application of sensor data and support vector machine for faller classification achieved an overall accuracy of 89.4% with 92.7% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity. These findings suggest that wearable inertial sensor based systems show promise for elderly fall risk assessment, which could be implemented in clinical practice to identify “at-risk” individuals reliably to promote proactive fall prevention.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,Unknown,8,N/A,2018,2018-11-05,63,66,"Hai Qiu, R.

In particular, toddler’s unique behaviors, such as riding in a stroller or being carried by an adult, have not yet been examined. The objective of this study was to describe accelerometry signal outputs recorded during participation in nine types of behaviors (i.e., running, walking, climbing up/down, crawling, riding a ride-on toy, standing, sitting, riding in a stroller/wagon, and being carried by an adult) among toddlers. Twenty-four toddlers aged 13 to 35 months (50% girls) performed various prescribed behaviors during free play in a commercial indoor playroom while wearing ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on a hip and a wrist. Participants’ performances were video-recorded. Based on the video data, accelerometer data were annotated with behavior labels to examine accelerometry signal outputs while performing the nine types of behaviors. Accelerometer data collected during 664 behavior assessments from the 21 participants were used for analysis. Hip vertical axis counts for walking were low (median = 49 counts/5 s). They were significantly lower than those recorded while a toddler was “carried” by an adult (median = 144 counts/5 s; p < 0.01). While standing, sitting, and riding in a stroller, very low hip vertical axis counts were registered (median ≤ 5 counts/5 s). Although wrist vertical axis and vector magnitude counts for “carried” were not higher than those for walking, they were higher than the cut-points for sedentary behaviors. Using various accelerometry signal features, machine learning techniques showed 89% accuracy to differentiate the “carried” behavior from ambulatory movements such as running, walking, crawling, and climbing. In conclusion, hip vertical axis counts alone may be unable to capture walking as physical activity and “carried” as sedentary behavior among toddlers. Machine learning techniques that utilize additional accelerometry signal features could help to recognize behavior types, especially to differentiate being “carried” from ambulatory movements.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Unknown,16,N/A,2019,2019-07-01,15,29,"Soyang Kwon, Patricia Zavos, Katherine P.

Graphs are essential in many domains, such as the description of chemical molecules, biological networks, social relationships, etc. Real-world graphs are complicated and large. As a result, there is a need to find a way to represent or encode a graph’s structure so that it can be easily utilized by machine learning models. Therefore, graph embedding is considered one of the most powerful solutions for graph representation. Inspired by the Doc2Vec model in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this paper first investigates different ways of (sub)graph embedding to represent each graph or subgraph as a fixed-length feature vector, which is then used as input to any classifier. Thus, two supervised classifiers—a deep neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)—are proposed to enhance graph classification. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed models obtain competitive results and are superior to some traditional classification methods and deep-learning-based approaches on three out of five benchmark datasets, with an impressive accuracy rate of 94% on the NCI1 dataset.",Electronics,journal,['JournalArticle'],ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2023,2023-06-17,3,32,"Sarah G.

Only two of the isomers have been detected in emissions from the interstellar medium (ISM); possible further candidates are identified, and the likelihood of their being detectable is considered. In general, hardly any of these compounds have been discussed in the existing chemical literature, so this work represents an important contribution extending the canon of chemical bonding which can contribute to machine learning, providing a more exacting test of AI applications. The presence in the ISM of acetamide, CH3C(O)NH2, is the subject of current debate with no clear and obvious paths to its formation; it is shown that a 1,3-[H]-transfer from (E,Z)-ethanimidic acid, CH3C(OH)=NH, is feasible in spite of an energy barrier of 130 kJ mol–1. It is speculated that imidic acid can itself be formed from abundant precursors, H2O and CH3C≡N, in an acid-induced, water addition, autocatalytic reaction on water–ice grains.

Most of the current research is based on an anchor box. These methods are complex in model design and time-consuming to train. In this paper, we propose a new Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection (FCOS)-based text detection method that can robustly detect multioriented and multilingual text from natural scene images in a per pixel prediction approach. Our proposed text detector employs an anchor-free approach, unlike state-of-the-art text detectors that do not rely on a predefined anchor box. In order to enhance the feature representation ability of FCOS for text detection tasks, we apply the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) as the backbone network, enhancing the model learning capacity and increasing the receptive field. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on multioriented (ICDAR-2015, ICDAR-2017 MLT) and horizontal (ICDAR-2013) text detection benchmark tasks. Moreover, our method has an f-measure of 88.65 and 86.32 for the benchmark datasets ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015, respectively, and 80.75 for the ICDAR-2017 MLT dataset.",Symmetry,journal,['JournalArticle'],1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,486,13,N/A,2021,2021-03-16,8,61,"Dongping Cao, Jiachen Dang, Yong Zhong","46690737, 2041846875, 2023972375",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d0a52ce890a794b16d3379f96c6cbb7e0acaa,Computer Science,46690737

The goal is to enhance networking within these dynamic environments. By leveraging SDN's centralized control capabilities, this study aims to optimize network performance, enhance security, and improve the quality of service in 5G-VANETs. The outcomes of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems and vehicular communication networks. As the VANET milieu operates dynamically, the major issues are to afford high reliability, low latency, and high bandwidth. 5G significantly provides seamless connectivity and ultrafast speed for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Advancements in internet of vehicle brought few security issues such as illegal device access, data injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To avoid these issues, this work implements the Package Filtering Model (PFM) that is trained using machine learning and ready to use for real-time detection. It filters out the fraudulent transaction based on the frequency and behavioural characteristics of the communication. The simulation results ensure that the proposed mechanism affords enhanced packet delivery, lower transmission delay, minimum fraud package, and bare minimum block processing time compared to the existing state-of-the-art mechanisms.",International Journal of Computer Networks And Applications,journal,['JournalArticle'],6b9982c4-b772-466f-a442-15ccbb7ac6e3,International Journal of Computer Networks and Applications,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2025,2025-02-28,0,31,"P.

A systemic review and a meta-analysis. We also provided a retrospective cohort for validation in this study.


OBJECTIVE
(1) Using a meta-analysis to determine the pooled discriminatory ability of The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classical algorithm (CA) and machine learning algorithms (MLA); and (2) test the hypothesis that SORG-CA has less variability in performance than SORG-MLA in non-American validation cohorts as SORG-CA does not incorporates regional-specific variables such as body mass index as input.


METHODS
After data extraction from the included studies, logit-transformation was applied for extracted AUCs for further analysis. The discriminatory abilities of both algorithms were directly compared by their logit (AUC)s. Further subgroup analysis by region (America vs non-America) was also conducted by comparing the corresponding logit (AUC).


RESULTS
The pooled logit (AUC)s of 90-day SORG-CA was .82 (95% confidence interval [CI], .53-.11), 1-year SORG-CA was 1.11 (95% CI, .74-1.48), 90-day SORG-MLA was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.63), and 1-year SORG-MLA was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.17-1.98). All the algorithms performed better in United States than in Taiwan (P < .001). The performance of SORG-CA was less influenced by a non-American cohort than SORG-MLA.


CONCLUSION
These observations might highlight the importance of incorporating region-specific variables into existing models to make them generalizable to racially or geographically distinct regions.",Global Spine Journal,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",405be97c-7be0-49bc-8575-24dba18cd046,Global spine journal,"

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) complicates clinical manifestations of stroke. In this study, we redefined the CSVD burden score and incorporated it into a novel radiological-clinical prediction model for SAP. Materials and methods A total of 1278 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 were included. The participants were divided into training and testing groups using fivefold cross-validation method. Four models, two traditional statistical models (logistic regression and ISAN) and two machine learning models (random forest and support vector machine), were established and evaluated. The outcomes and baseline characteristics were compared between the SAP and non-SAP groups. Results Among the of 1278 patients, 281(22.0%) developed SAP after their first ICH. Multivariate analysis revealed that the logistic regression (LR) model was superior in predicting SAP in both the training and testing groups. Independent predictors of SAP after ICH included total CSVD burden score (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.54), haematoma extension into ventricle (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.87–3.31), haematoma with multilobar involvement (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.44–3.18), transpharyngeal intubation operation (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.7–5.62), admission NIHSS score ≥ 10 (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.42–3.01), male sex (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16–2.52), and age ≥ 67 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.56–3.22). The patients in the SAP group had worse outcomes than those in the non-SAP group. Conclusion This study established a clinically combined imaging model for predicting stroke-associated pneumonia and demonstrated superior performance compared with the existing ISAN model. Given the poor outcomes observed in patients with SAP, the use of individualised predictive nomograms is vital in clinical practice.",BMC Pulmonary Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],6ec15f55-3f39-4e6e-81c4-b0f2aa166058,BMC Pulmonary Medicine,Unknown,24,N/A,2024,2024-07-24,1,43,"Wenru Zhang, Ying Zhou, Liuhui Xu, Chaomin Qiu, Zhixian Luo, Zhenghao Jiang, Xinyi Tao, Yingjie Wu, Shishi Yao, Hang Huang, Xinshi Wang, Yunjun Yang, Ru Lin","2312864048, 2272424983, 2170670021, 2295156156, 2271124396, 2271748002, 2270428859, 2312875339, 2312902269, 2313030846, 2312866805, 2270702453, 2150033004",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000e245ed752d1169163ed02ffc2fdadd18e2540,"Computer Science, Medicine",2312864048

We hypothesized that signal processing and machine learning methods can be used to discriminate EEG in a direct ""yes""/""no"" BCI from a single session. Blind source separation (BSS) and spectral transformations of the EEG produced a 180-dimensional feature space. We used a modified genetic algorithm (GA) wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to search the space of feature subsets. The GA-based search found feature subsets that outperform full feature sets and random feature subsets. Also, BSS transformations of the EEG outperformed the original time series, particularly in conjunction with a subset search of both spaces.

Known as precision agriculture, the integration of digital management and surveillance technologies in farming is normatively presented as a revolutionary transformation. Proponents contend that machine learning, Big Data, and automation will create more accurate, efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly food production, staving off both food insecurity and ecological ruin. This article contributes a critique of these rhetorical and discursive claims to a growing body of critical literature on precision agriculture. It argues precision agriculture is less a revolution than an evolution, an effort to shore up and intensify the conventional farming system responsible for generating many of the social and environmental problems precision agriculture is presented as solving. While precision agriculture advocates portray it as a radical, even democratic epistemological break with the past, this paper locates truth claims surrounding datafication and algorithmic control in farming within deeper historical contexts of the capitalist rationalization of production and efforts to quantify and automate physical and mental labor. Abjuring the growing cultural tendency to treat algorithmic systems as revolutionary in favor of social and historical dimensions of precision agriculture, can help re-frame the discussion about its design and use around real, socially and ecologically oriented change in farming, and so ensure that the possibilities and benefits of precision agriculture are as evenly and effectively shared as possible.",Big Data & Society,journal,['JournalArticle'],4d899b46-b5c8-436e-8ce3-084673ea8905,Big Data & Society,Unknown,6,N/A,2019,2019-01-01,115,81,Christopher Miles,48512538,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f4079fb3f5463ce7f5e566b541fec68a91f02,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science, Economics, Environmental Science",48512538

Previous studies reveal that disordered regions of a protein can be predicted by its primary structure, the amino acid sequence. One observation that has been widely accepted is that ordered regions usually have compositional bias toward hydrophobic amino acids, and disordered regions are toward charged amino acids. Recent studies further show that employing evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) improves the prediction accuracy of protein disorder. As more and more machine learning techniques have been introduced to protein disorder detection, extracting more useful features with biological insights attracts more attention.ResultsThis paper first studies the effect of a condensed position specific scoring matrix with respect to physicochemical properties (PSSMP) on the prediction accuracy, where the PSSMP is derived by merging several amino acid columns of a PSSM belonging to a certain property into a single column. Next, we decompose each conventional physicochemical property of amino acids into two disjoint groups which have a propensity for order and disorder respectively, and show by experiments that some of the new properties perform better than their parent properties in predicting protein disorder. In order to get an effective and compact feature set on this problem, we propose a hybrid feature selection method that inherits the efficiency of uni-variant analysis and the effectiveness of the stepwise feature selection that explores combinations of multiple features. The experimental results show that the selected feature set improves the performance of a classifier built with Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) in comparison with the feature set constructed with PSSMs or PSSMPs that adopt simply the conventional physicochemical properties.ConclusionDistinguishing disordered regions from ordered regions in protein sequences facilitates the exploration of protein structures and functions. Results based on independent testing data reveal that the proposed predicting model DisPSSMP performs the best among several of the existing packages doing similar tasks, without either under-predicting or over-predicting the disordered regions. Furthermore, the selected properties are demonstrated to be useful in finding discriminating patterns for order/disorder classification.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Study']",be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,319 - 319,7,N/A,2006,2006-06-23,99,48,"Chung-Tsai Su, Chien-Yu Chen, Yu-Yen Ou","3157188, 97913682, 2781033",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f70100783b16315ff748f23387076fc91d876,"Biology, Computer Science, Medicine",3157188

With the advancements in technology, machine learning architectures have become increasingly diverse and sophisticated, providing enhanced capabilities for fruit image classification. However, previous studies have primarily focused on classifying fruits at a basic level. Therefore, there is a growing need for the development and application of Fruit Image Classification systems within the community, particularly in the field of agriculture. Such applications can play a pivotal role in leveraging technology to benefit the agricultural sector, empowering users to gain satisfaction and knowledge regarding different fruits through the utilization of these applications. In this study, we employ both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and a Residual Network-50 for fruit image classification. To ensure robust performance evaluation, the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, with fruits categorized into specific classes. Furthermore, identical preprocessing and optimization techniques are applied to both architectures to maintain consistency and fairness during the evaluation process. The results of our classification experiments on a dataset consisting of 17 different fruit classes reveal that the conventional CNN architecture achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.998 (99%) with a minimal loss of 0.009. On the other hand, the Residual Network-50 demonstrates a slightly lower accuracy of 0.994 (99%) but with a slightly higher loss of 0.02. Despite the higher loss, the Residual Network-50's accuracy remains comparable to that of the conventional architecture, showcasing its potential for fruit image classification. By leveraging the power of machine learning and these advanced architectures, fruit image classification systems can provide valuable insights and assistance to users. They can facilitate informed decision-making in various domains, including agriculture, food production, and consumer education.",SinkrOn,journal,['JournalArticle'],d0d49d6f-212a-445d-a93a-87a97f150ec2,SinkrOn,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2023,2023-07-30,4,19,"Arie Satia Dharma, Judah Michael Parluhutan Sitorus, Andreas Hatigoran","123539048, 2230000137, 2230012656",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001032618456896dd0a618909d0fe443ced9e159,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science",123539048

The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

Datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We integrated the datasets, removed the batch effects and analyzed immune cell infiltration along with differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the positively correlated gene modules. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-cox regression analysis was performed to screen the characteristic genes. The intersection of the DEGs, characteristic genes and module genes was identified as the risk genes. The WGCNA analysis demonstrates that the blue module was highly correlated and statistically significant as well as enriched in immune-related signaling pathways and biological functions in the KEGG and GO enrichment. LASSO-cox regression analysis screened 11 characteristic genes from the hub genes of the blue module. After the DEG, characteristic gene and immune-related gene datasets were intersected, three genes, PTGS1, HLA-DMB and GPR137B, were identified as the risk genes in this research.

As a result, for hydropower generation to be sustainable, future water availability in hydropower plants must be known. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely estimate how the river flow will alter as a result of changing rainfall patterns. Finding the best value for the hyper-parameters is one of the problems with machine learning algorithms, which have lately been adopted by many academics. In this research, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is integrated with a nature-inspired optimizer, namely Cuckoo search algorithm (CS-ANN). The performance of the proposed algorithm then will be examined based on statistical indices namely Root-Mean-Square Error (RSME) and Determination Coefficient ( R 2 ). Then, the accuracy of the proposed model will be then examined with the stand-alone Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The statistical indices results indicate that the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model showed an improvement based on R 2 value as compared to ANN model with R 2 of 0.900 at training stage and R 2 of 0.935 at testing stage. RMSE value, for ANN model, is 127.79 m 3 /s for training stage and 12.7 m 3 /s at testing stage. While for the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model, RMSE value is equal to 121.7 m 3 /s for training stage and 10.95 m 3 /s for testing stage. The results revealed that the proposed model outperformed the stand-alone model in predicting the river flow with high level of accuracy. Although the proposed model could be applied in different case study, there is a need to tune the model internal parameters when applied in different case study.",Applied Water Science,journal,,3a7506a1-210b-44de-bc20-463e93b86599,Applied Water Science,1-10,13,N/A,2022,2022-12-05,10,33,"W.

Machine learning algorithms could provide an objective theoretical basis for tunnel parameter decision making. However, due to the limitations of a machine learning model’s performance and parameter selection methods, the prediction model had poor prediction results and low reliability for parameter research. To solve the above problems, based on a large number of construction parameters of a composite section subway in Shenzhen, this paper combined dimensionality reduction data with service analysis to optimize the selection process of shield tunneling parameters, and determined the total propulsion force, cutter head torque, cutter head speed, and advance rate as key tunneling parameters. Based on an LGBM algorithm and Bayesian optimization, the prediction model of key tunneling parameters of an earth pressure balance shield was established. The results showed that the average error of the LGBM model on the test set was 8.18%, the average error of the cutter head torque was 13.93%, the average error of the cutter head speed was 3.16%, and the average error of advance rate was 13.35%. Compared with the RF model, the prediction effect and the generalization on the test set were better. Therefore, an LGBM algorithm could be used as an effective prediction method for tunneling parameters in tunnel construction and provide guidance for the setting of tunneling parameters.",Buildings,journal,['JournalArticle'],f2c78b1b-6bcc-4700-859b-af9401c02941,Buildings,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,2024-03-18,1,24,"Wei Wang, Huanhuan Feng, Yanzong Li, Quanwei You, Xu Zhou","2158625346, 2292351109, 2292205846, 2228271705, 2292731898",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011cc42b727f0c20683a45184e30bcc6668835c,"Computer Science, Engineering",2158625346

Nowadays, going 24 hours without getting in touch with them in some way has become difficult. Facebook and Twitter, these social platforms are now part of everyday life. Thus, these social networks have become important sources to be aware of frequently discussed topics or public opinions on a current issue. A lot of people write messages about current events, give their opinion on any topic and discuss social issues more and more. The emergence and enormous popularity of these social networks have led to the emergence of several types of analysis to take advantage of them. One of them is the analysis of opinions in texts. It aims at automatically classifying opinions in order to position them on a sentiment scale, thus allowing to characterize a set of opinions without having to rely on a human to read them. Currently, opinion analysis offers us a lot of information related to public opinion, either in the commercial world or in the political world. Many studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB), perform well in this type of classification. In our study, we first propose an approach for tracking and analyzing political opinions in social networks. Then, we propose a trained and evaluated machine learning model for political opinion classification. And finally, the study aims at setting up a web interface to collect and analyze in real time political opinions from social networks",International journal of Web & Semantic Technology,journal,,a6c17d51-9c07-495f-ae6b-3738e69a9098,International journal of Web & Semantic Technology,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2021,2021-10-31,0,36,"Télesphore Tiendrébéogo, Yassia Zagre","2111964, 2140541021",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011fc48fe76fd7f48139a75f9bdf1a83e0f4cd9,Political Science,2111964

Hence, the limitations of prediction models can highly impact prioritizing maintenance tasks and allocating budget. This study aims to investigate the potential of different predictive models in reaching an effective and efficient maintenance plan. This paper reviews the literature on predictive analytics for a set of highway assets. It also highlights the gaps and limitations of the current methodologies, such as subjective assumptions and simplifications applied in deterministic and probabilistic approaches. This article additionally discusses how these shortcomings impact the application and accuracy of the methods, and how advanced predictive analytics can mitigate the challenges. In this review, we discuss how advancements in technologies coupled with ever-increasing computing power are creating opportunities for a paradigm shift in predictive analytics. We also propose new research directions including the application of advanced machine learning to develop extensible and scalable prediction models and leveraging emerging sensing technologies for collecting, storing and analyzing the data.

When the size of datasets becomes very large, it may be infeasible to store all of the high-dimensional datasets on one machine, or at least to keep the datasets in memory. In this paper, we consider penalized expectile regression using smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and adaptive LASSO penalties, which can effectively detect the heteroskedasticity of high-dimensional data. We propose a communication-efficient approach for distributed sparsity learning, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines. By selecting the appropriate tuning parameters, we show that the proposed estimators display oracle properties.

Although many NER models based on machine learning have been proposed, their performance in terms of processing fine-grained NER tasks was less than acceptable. This is because the training data of a fine-grained NER task is much more unbalanced than those of a coarse-grained NER task. To overcome the problem presented by unbalanced data, we propose a fine-grained NER model that compensates for the sparseness of fine-grained NEs by using the contextual information of coarse-grained NEs. From another viewpoint, many NER models have used different levels of features, such as part-of-speech tags and gazetteer look-up results, in a nonhierarchical manner. Unfortunately, these models experience the feature interference problem. Our solution to this problem is to adopt a multi-stacked feature fusion scheme, which accepts different levels of features as its input. The proposed model is based on multi-stacked long short-term memories (LSTMs) with a multi-stacked feature fusion layer for acquiring multilevel embeddings and a dual-stacked output layer for predicting fine-grained NEs based on the categorical information of coarse-grained NEs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed model is capable of state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the proposed model can effectively alleviate the unbalanced data problem that frequently occurs in a fine-grained NER task. In addition, the multi-stacked feature fusion layer contributes to the improvement of NER performance, confirming that the proposed model can alleviate the feature interference problem. Based on this experimental result, we conclude that the proposed model is well-designed to effectively perform NER tasks.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2021,2021-11-15,5,8,"Hongjin Kim, Harksoo Kim","2110134563, 2108880610",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0014ecb6e7055de7b3bef3d5619446c24fdf0db4,"Computer Science, Linguistics",2110134563

Conveniently, these compact devices are also equipped with high-precision transducers such as accelerometers and microphones, integrated mechanically and designed on-board to support a range of user functionalities. However, unintended access to these transducer signals (bypassing normal on-board data access controls) may allow sensitive user interaction information to be detected and thereby exploited. In this study, we show that acoustic features extracted from the on-board microphone signals, supported with accelerometer and gyroscope signals, may be used together with machine learning techniques to successfully determine the user’s touch input location on a touchscreen: our ensemble model, namely the random forest model, predicts touch input location with up to 86% accuracy in a realistic scenario. Accordingly, we present the approach and techniques used, the performance of the model developed, and also discuss limitations and possible mitigation methods to thwart possible exploitation of such unintended signal channels.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,4834,11,N/A,2021,2021-05-25,3,30,"K.

Yet the current paradigm for perfusion MRI analysis treats all voxels or regions‐of‐interest as isolated systems supplied by a single global source. This simplification not only leads to long‐recognized systematic errors but also fails to leverage the embedded spatial structure within the data. Since the early 2000s, a variety of models and implementations have been proposed to analyze systems with between‐voxel interactions. In general, this leads to large and connected numerical inverse problems that are intractible with conventional computational methods. With recent advances in machine learning, however, these approaches are becoming practically feasible, opening up the way for a paradigm shift in the approach to perfusion MRI. This paper seeks to review the work in spatiotemporal modelling of perfusion MRI using a coherent, harmonized nomenclature and notation, with clear physical definitions and assumptions. The aim is to introduce clarity in the state‐of‐the‐art of this promising new approach to perfusion MRI, and help to identify gaps of knowledge and priorities for future research.",Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",c1269fa2-b51c-4648-bf0c-95797c4a74cd,Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,1136 - 1148,91,N/A,2023,2023-11-06,3,73,"Eve S Shalom, Amirul Khan, S. van Loo, S.

A case-control study was conducted and included 177 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 173 control subjects to study the involvement of CD36 gene rs1761667 (G>A) and rs1527483 (C>T) polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of T2DM and dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Lipid profile, blood sugar, gender and age were measured and recorded. Also, genotyping analysis for both polymorphisms was performed. Following statistical analysis, 10 different neural networks and machine learning (ML) tools were used to predict subjects with diabetes or dyslipidemia. Towards further understanding of the role of CD36 protein and gene in T2DM and dyslipidemia, a protein-protein interaction network and meta-analysis were carried out. For both polymorphisms, the genotypic frequencies were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). On the other hand, some ML tools like multilayer perceptron gave high prediction accuracy (≥ 0.75) and Cohen’s kappa (κ) (≥ 0.5). Interestingly, in K-star tool, the accuracy and Cohen’s κ values were enhanced by including the genotyping results as inputs (0.73 and 0.46, respectively, compared to 0.67 and 0.34 without including them). This study confirmed, for the first time, that there is no association between CD36 polymorphisms and T2DM or dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Prediction of T2DM and dyslipidemia, using these extensive ML tools and based on such input data, is a promising approach for developing diagnostic and prognostic prediction models for a wide spectrum of diseases, especially based on large medical databases.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,16,N/A,2021,2021-10-14,9,104,"Ma’mon M.

The previously used linear method, unable to cope with the augmented features, is replaced with a boosting classifier assisted by feature selection. The methods indicated show improved performance for 6 language pairs, when applied on the output from MT systems developed over 7 years. The improved models compete better with reference-aware metrics. Notable conclusions are reached through the examination of the contribution of the features in the models, whereas it is possible to identify common MT errors that are captured by the features. Many grammatical/fluency features have a good contribution, few adequacy features have some contribution, whereas source complexity features are of no use. The importance of many fluency and adequacy features is language-specific.",Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics,journal,['JournalArticle'],40983fd6-6306-48fc-9433-88d263951b9b,The Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics,307 - 318,108,N/A,2017,2017-06-01,5,22,Eleftherios Avramidis,2837687,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00166549b38c2935bbf978cb128dbb0a6c63c95e,"Computer Science, Linguistics",2837687

Reliable and updated road information thus calls for conventional on-site survey being replaced by more accurate and efficient remote sensing technology. Generally, this approach involves image enhancement and extraction of relevant features, such as elongate gradient and intersecting corners. Thus far, its implication is often impeded by wrongly extraction of other urban peripherals with similar pixel characteristics. This paper therefore proposes the fusion of THEOS satellite image and topographic derivatives, obtained from underlying Digital Surface Models (DSM). Multi-spectral indices in thematic layers and surface properties of designated roads were both fed into state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The results were later fused, taken into account consistently leveled road surface. The proposed technique was thus able to eliminate irrelevant urban structures such as buildings and other constructions, otherwise left by conventional index based extraction. The numerical assessment indicates recall of 84.64%, precision of 97.40% and overall accuracy of 97.78%, with 0.89 Kappa statistics.

This research focuses on exploring the latest solutions in preventing DDoS attacks and emphasizes how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is involved in enhancing end-to-end detection techniques. Through the analysis of several key approaches, this work notes that AI-guided models quickly identify and counteract any unusual traffic patterns that may indicate an oncoming DDoS attack. Essential aspects towards creating more resilient networks against such attacks include machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data analytics together with AI based detection systems for traffic pattern recognition. Importantly, AI does well in behavioral analysis because it can distinguish and adapt to changing attack vectors. Additionally, it puts AI into perspective as making positive mitigation strategies possible that contain quick interferences such as temporary halt of traffic, rerouting and targeted block listing with real time control panel operations. On the contrary, current DDoS detection prevention techniques remain critically addressed of persistent challenges and limitations fundamental to them. From what emerges, they should always be ready for innovation and improvement because of how attacks might evolve over time. This paper aligns itself with the position that AI-driven detection mechanisms are natural to network security against DDoS attacks. It underlines the importance of integrating AI-based solutions with conventional practices in order to enhance network resilience and efficiently counteract cyber threats that are evolving all the time.",Indonesian Journal of Computer Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],f5cd2a19-4ebb-4a91-b0de-777a2e52ce7c,The Indonesian Journal of Computer Science,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,2024-04-20,0,24,"Soran Hamad, S.

In this paper, we present a novel efficient method for thermal and energy management based on bimodal airflow-temperature sensing and reinforcement learning, which expedites an exploration process by self-learning and adjusts action policy only through actuators interacting with the environment, being free of the controlled object model and priori experiences. In general, training of reinforcement learning requires a large amount of data iterations, which takes a long time and is not suitable for real-time control. Here, we propose an approach to speed up the learning process by indicating the action adjustment direction. We adopt tailor-designed bimodal sensors to simultaneously detect airflow and temperature field, which provides comprehensive information for reinforcement learning. The proposed thermal and energy management incorporates bimodal parametric sensing with an improved actor-critic algorithm to realize self-learning control. Experiments of thermal and energy management in a multi-module integrated system validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which demonstrate high efficiency, fast response, and good robustness in various control scenarios.

Early and accurate detection of PD is crucial for effective treatment and management. This research explores the application of machine learning techniques to detect Parkinson's disease using vocal features from the UCI Parkinson's Disease Data Set. The study compares the performance of four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with each model evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrix metrics. The Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier achieved perfect accuracy on the training set, while the SVM model demonstrated the highest accuracy (89.74%) on the test set with a recall rate of 96.77%.

As a result, this research examines the rising body of knowledge on social media and crisis management. [1] Between October 2017 and January 2018, a review was conducted, which included locating and retrieving records from an electronic database. The outcomes of this study indicated that the rise of social media has altered the landscape of crisis communication by allowing for greater engagement. However, due to its nature, social media might also be used to spark a crisis. This means that the crisis can be both produced and disseminated through social media. Nonetheless, social media's promise as a crisis-resolution tool is undeniable. It has the capability of proving a claim, dispelling false rumors, or just demonstrating a fact. As a result, practitioners should understand how social media works and how to best use it to interact with their stakeholders. This study also includes other findings, limits, and useful suggestions for scholars and practitioners interested in learning more about the role of social media on crisis communication and management. As most of the crisis problem were reported via twitter. However, most of the problem reported and corresponding responses via twitter were not successfully exchanged between victim’s and resource organization. As a result, most of the tweets were not getting help. Thus, we designed a platform where people can avail the resources of crisis through tweets matching concept using machine learning.","International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology",journal,['Review'],18be6e14-0ac5-454e-b78d-100e2dddd04e,"International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology",Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2022,2022-04-22,0,6,"Shaikh Areeba Abdul Hakeem, Muskan Singh, Pooja Nandukumar Shingewad, Shruti Shrikant Nikam","2163319579, 2163320822, 2163320765, 2163321391",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0019a174cf9c82fc7084a3a27e548c2a06e0a8c9,Computer Science,2163319579

A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction (DOI) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network (NN), as well as a multiple linear regression (MLR)-based method to estimate DOI in depolished PET detector arrays with single-sided readout. The algorithms were tested on an 8× 8 array of 1.53× 1.53× 15 mm3 crystals and a 4× 4 array of 3.1× 3.1× 15 mm3 crystals, both made of Ce:LYSO scintillators and coupled to a 4× 4 array of 3× 3 mm3 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Using the conventional linear DOI estimation method resulted in an average DOI resolution of 3.76 mm and 3.51 mm FWHM for the 8× 8 and the 4× 4 arrays, respectively. Application of MLR outperformed the conventional method with average DOI resolutions of 3.25 mm and 3.33 mm FWHM, respectively. Using the machine learning approaches further improved the DOI resolution, to an average DOI resolution of 2.99 mm and 3.14 mm FWHM, respectively, and additionally improved the uniformity of the DOI resolution in both arrays. Lastly, preliminary results obtained by using only a section of the crystal array for training showed that the NN-based methods could be used to reduce the number of calibration steps required for each detector array.",Physics in Medicine and Biology,journal,['JournalArticle'],d5594aad-095f-4587-802a-b011732c7100,Physics in Medicine & Biology,Unknown,65,N/A,2020,2020-06-22,16,36,"A.

Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. To address the class imbalance problem (few real miRNAs and a large number of pseudo miRNAs), the prediction models in miRLocator were optimized by considering critical (and often ignored) factors that can markedly affect the prediction accuracy of mature miRNAs, including the machine learning algorithm and the ratio between training positive and negative samples. Ten-fold cross-validation on 5854 experimentally validated miRNAs from 19 plant species showed that miRLocator performed better than the state-of-art miRNA predictor miRdup in locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. miRLocator will aid researchers interested in discovering miRNAs from model and non-model plant species.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,10,N/A,2015,2015-11-11,26,21,"HaiBo Cui, Jingjing Zhai, Chuang Ma","2112820873, 6989114, 49679382",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c15accd39827ecf9838d496b7e44e9f890ee7,"Biology, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Medicine",2112820873

The current prognosis approaches include radiological examination and detection of serum biomarkers, however, both have limited efficiency and are ineffective in early prognosis. Due to such limitations, we propose to use RNA-Seq data for evaluating putative higher accuracy biomarkers at the transcript level that could help in early prognosis. To identify such potential transcript biomarkers, RNA-Seq data for healthy liver and various HCC cell models were subjected to five different machine learning algorithms: random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and neural networks. Various metrics, namely sensitivity, specificity, MCC, informedness, and AUC-ROC (except for support vector machine) were evaluated. The algorithms that produced the highest values for all metrics were chosen to extract the top features that were subjected to recursive feature elimination. Through recursive feature elimination, the least number of features were obtained to differentiate between the healthy and HCC cell models. From the metrics used, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of the known protein biomarkers for HCC is comparatively lower than complete transcriptomics data. Among the different machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector machine demonstrated the best performance. Using recursive feature elimination on top features of random forest and support vector machine three transcripts were selected that had an accuracy of 0.97 and kappa of 0.93. Of the three transcripts, two were protein coding (PARP2–202 and SPON2–203) and one was a non-coding transcript (CYREN-211). Lastly, we demonstrated that these three selected transcripts outperformed randomly taken three transcripts (15,000 combinations), hence were not chance findings, and could then be an interesting candidate for new HCC biomarker development. Using RNA-Seq data combined with machine learning approaches can aid in finding novel transcript biomarkers. The three biomarkers identified: PARP2–202, SPON2–203, and CYREN-211, presented the highest accuracy among all other transcripts in differentiating the healthy and HCC cell models. The machine learning pipeline developed in this study can be used for any RNA-Seq dataset to find novel transcript biomarkers.

This study investigated and analyzed particulate matter data from Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Jeollanam-do, with a particular focus on PM2.5. Descriptive statistics, box-and-whisker plots, correlation matrices, time variations, and trend analyses were performed for this purpose. Additionally, a prediction model for PM2.5 concentrations was developed using machine learning techniques, through which future changes in air quality were forecasted. 
Calculations were performed using R-based programs and R packages. Hourly PM2.5 data were obtained from air quality monitoring sites in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon. After data preprocessing, the optimal prediction model was constructed using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine from various machine learning algorithms. 
The research results showed that there was more PM2.5 pollution in Gwangyang compared to Yeosu and Suncheon. The PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly across each monitoring site. Among the monitoring sites, the Yeosu site showed a higher correlation in PM2.5 with each other than other sites. Late winter and early spring showed higher PM2.5 concentrations, while summer and autumn showed lower concentrations. Weekly PM2.5 concentration fluctuations were not significantly different. Daily fluctuations showed an increase in PM2.5 concentrations during times of traffic congestion and a decrease in the afternoon. During the research period, the trend of PM2.5 concentration was generally decreasing. 
The accuracy of the prediction model through machine learning was over 90%, and it is expected to assist in establishing effective response strategies for future changes in air quality. This study provided an updated and useful evaluation of recent PM2.5 air quality in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Korea.",International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication,journal,['JournalArticle'],30f717c3-b4cb-461f-9152-25a2fc4208e8,International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2023,2023-10-30,0,0,"Hyun Sim, Hyunwook Kim",2273444328,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c7d8d86582b11da522c0885509610ca86007e,"Computer Science, Environmental Science",2273444328

A postural habit that has been formed cannot be changed easily. It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2018,2018-08-01,48,55,"Y.

STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,17,N/A,2022,2022-08-11,4,38,"Mansour Al Sulaiman, Abdullah M.

Neuroimaging and machine learning approaches provide new research directions to explore the brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms after stroke. We applied machine learning to predict the classification of the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for motor improvement and identify the neuroimaging features, in order to explore brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms for motor recovery after stroke. Methods In this study, 49 patients with unilateral motor pathway injury (basal ganglia and/or corona radiata) after ischemic stroke were included and evaluated the motor function by Fugl–Meyer Assessment scores (FMA) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up sessions. Patients were divided by the difference between the twice FMA scores into one group showing minimal clinically important difference (MCID group, n = 28) and the other group with no minimal clinically important difference (N-MCID, n = 21). Machine learning was performed by PRoNTo software to predict the classification of the patients and identify the feature brain regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, a matched group of healthy controls (HC, n = 26) was enrolled. Patients and HC underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination in the resting state and in the acupuncture state (acupuncture at the Yanglingquan point on one side) to compare the differences in brain functional connectivity (FC) and acupuncture effects. Results Through machine learning, we obtained a balance accuracy rate of 75.51% and eight feature ROIs. Compared to HC, we found that the stroke patients with lower FC between these feature ROIs with other brain regions, while patients in the MCID group exhibited a wider range of lower FC. When acupuncture was applied to Yanglingquan (GB 34), the abnormal FC of patients was decreased, with different targets of effects in different groups. Conclusion Feature ROIs identified by machine learning can predict the classification of stroke patients with different motor improvements, and the FC between these ROIs with other brain regions is decreased. Acupuncture can modulate the bilateral cerebral hemispheres to restore abnormal FC via different targets, thereby promoting motor recovery after stroke.

Significance Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms have rapidly become much more widespread for numerous biomedical applications, including the diagnosis and categorization of disease and injury. Aim Here, we seek to characterize the recent growth of ML techniques that use imaging data to classify burn wound severity and report on the accuracies of different approaches. Approach To this end, we present a comprehensive literature review of preclinical and clinical studies using ML techniques to classify the severity of burn wounds. Results The majority of these reports used digital color photographs as input data to the classification algorithms, but recently there has been an increasing prevalence of the use of ML approaches using input data from more advanced optical imaging modalities (e.g., multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography), in addition to multimodal techniques. The classification accuracy of the different methods is reported; it typically ranges from ∼70% to 90% relative to the current gold standard of clinical judgment. Conclusions The field would benefit from systematic analysis of the effects of different input data modalities, training/testing sets, and ML classifiers on the reported accuracy. Despite this current limitation, ML-based algorithms show significant promise for assisting in objectively classifying burn wound severity.",Journal of Biomedical Optics,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3a712262-b7d9-4756-94a1-57c2f9d4197c,Journal of Biomedical Optics,Unknown,29,N/A,2024,2024-02-01,4,85,"Robert H Wilson, Rebecca Rowland, Gordon T.

Their unobtrusive nature and ability to provide reliable heart rate measurements facilitate the estimation of cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes, as quantified by maximum consumption of oxygen uptake. Previous studies have employed data-driven models which use heart rate information to estimate the cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes. This signifies the physiological relevance of heart rate and heart rate variability for the estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. In this work, the heart rate variability features that were extracted from both exercise and recovery segments were fed to three different Machine Learning models to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of 856 athletes performing Graded Exercise Testing. A total of 101 features from exercise and 30 features from recovery segments were given as input to three feature selection methods to avoid overfitting of the models and to obtain relevant features. This resulted in the increase of model’s accuracy by 5.7% for exercise and 4.3% for recovery. Further, post-modelling analysis was performed to remove the deviant points in two cases, initially in both training and testing and then only in training set, using k-Nearest Neighbour. In the former case, the removal of deviant points led to a reduction of 19.3% and 18.0% in overall estimation error for exercise and recovery, respectively. In the latter case, which mimicked the real-world scenario, the average R value of the models was observed to be 0.72 and 0.70 for exercise and recovery, respectively. From the above experimental approach, the utility of heart rate variability to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of large population of athletes was validated. Additionally, the proposed work contributes to the utility of cardiorespiratory fitness assessment of athletes through wearable heart rate monitors.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,23,20193dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2023,2023-03-01,2,54,"Vaishali Balakarthikeyan, Rohan Jais, S.

However, more knowledge of protein structure-activity correlation is required to improve the efficacy of the drugs targeting GPCRs. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict activation state and activity level of the receptors with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we applied this model to thousands of molecular dynamics trajectories to correlate residue-level conformational changes of a GPCR to its activity level. Finally, the most probable transition pathway between activation states of a receptor can be identified by using the state-activity information. In addition, with this model, we can associate the contribution of each amino acid to the activation process. Using this method we will be able to design drugs that mainly target principal amino acids driving the transition between activation states of GPCRs.

Controlling the genetic and physiological factors of IMF and the expression patterns of various genes is important for regulating the IMF content and improving meat quality in pig breeding. Growing evidence has suggested the role of genetic factors and breeds in IMF deposition; however, research on the sex factors of IMF deposition is still lacking. The present study aimed to identify potential sex-specific biomarkers strongly associated with IMF deposition in low- and high-IMF pig populations. The GSE144780 expression dataset of IMF deposition-related genes were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in male and female low-IMF (162 DEGs, including 64 up- and 98 down-regulated genes) and high-IMF pigs (202 DEGs, including 147 up- and 55 down-regulated genes). Moreover, hub genes were screened via PPI network construction. Furthermore, hub genes were screened for potential sex-specific biomarkers using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator machine learning algorithm, and sex-specific biomarkers in low-IMF (troponin I (TNNI1), myosin light chain 9(MYL9), and serpin family C member 1(SERPINC1)) and high-IMF pigs (CD4 molecule (CD4), CD2 molecule (CD2), and amine oxidase copper-containing 2(AOC2)) were identified, and then verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in semimembranosus muscles. Additionally, the gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of hallmark gene sets were collectively performed on the identified biomarkers. Finally, the transcription factor-biomarker and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (biomarker) networks were predicted. The identified potential sex-specific biomarkers may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of IMF deposition and the beneficial foundation for improving meat quality in pig breeding.",Genes,journal,['JournalArticle'],3a435ff9-d0c3-4eb9-9a89-992c0f8bf398,Genes,Unknown,14,N/A,2023,2023-08-25,2,81,"Yongli Yang, Xiaoyi Wang, Shuyan Wang, Qiang Chen, Mingli Li, Shaoxiong Lu","2236388442, 2155610656, 2108710355, 2146379306, 47629206, 8090588",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e4348bf3ea69ac952c0078282041986cdec3d,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Medicine",2236388442

However, multivariate mineralogical data must be transformed into lithological domains such that it is compatible with interpolation techniques and be usable for geomodeling. Manual interpretation of multivariate drill-core data is a challenging, time-consuming and subjective task, and automated or semi-automated approaches are needed. However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection. In this way, the correlation pattern between the variables is incorporated into the segmentation. The scalogram accurately locates the geological boundaries at depth and yields hierarchical geological domains with mineralogical composition characteristics. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a synthetic as well as a real multivariate dataset. The real dataset consists of mineral abundances derived from drill-core hyperspectral imaging data acquired in Elvira, a shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D. Our approach provides an automatic way to transform hyperspectral image-derived mineral maps into vertically coherent geological units that are appropriate inputs for 3D geological modeling workflows. Moreover, the method improves the boundary detection and geological domaining by making use of multivariate information.",Remote Sensing,journal,['JournalArticle'],8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

These methods outperform traditional, rule-based approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of intersecting features. However, existing deep learning-based AFR methods face two major challenges. The initial challenge stems from the frequent utilization of voxelized or point-cloud representations of CAD models, resulting in the unfortunate loss of valuable geometric and topological information inherent in original Boundary representation (B-Rep) models. The second challenge involves the limitation of supervised deep learning methods in identifying machining features that are not present in the predefined dataset. This constraint renders them suboptimal for the continually evolving datasets of real industrial scenarios. To address the first challenge, this study introduces a graph-structured language, Multidimensional Attributed Face-Edge Graph (maFEG), crafted to encapsulate the intricate geometric and topological details of CAD models. Furthermore, a graph neural network, Sheet-metalNet, is proposed for the efficient learning and interpretation of maFEGs. To tackle the second challenge, a three-component incremental learning strategy is proposed: an initial phase of pre-training and fine-tuning, a prototype sampling-based replay, and a stage employing knowledge distillation for parameter regularization. The effectiveness of Sheet-metalNet and its complementary incremental learning strategy is evaluated using the open-source MFCAD++ dataset and the newly created SMCAD dataset. Experimental results show that Sheet-metalNet surpasses state-of-the-art AFR methods in machining feature recognition accuracy. Moreover, Sheet-metalNet demonstrates adaptability to dynamic dataset changes, maintaining high performance when encountering newly introduced features, thanks to its innovative incremental learning strategy.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,Unknown,14,N/A,2024,2024-05-09,1,53,"Liuhuan Ma, Jiong Yang","2300714018, 2300498524",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ebb9f4f55c4e4e139d8c14d13808d6b5f6ba1,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2300714018

It is a concern that continues to be analyzed and addressed for solutions. Missing data occurs when there is no data stored for certain variables relating to participants. In health surveys, when participants answer in the form of “I don't know” or “I'd prefer not to answer”, these responses can, in many cases, be categorized as missing data responses from a participant in a specific category or question. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is an essential tool in healthcare and clinical settings to assess an individual's mental health, specifically related to symptoms of depression. The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with the total score obtained by summing the scores for each item. Higher PHQ-8 scores indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. We used empirical data from a previous study on depression symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease to study the effect of considering the answers “I do not know” and “I prefer not to answer” as missing values when estimating the percentage of depression using PHQ-8. Moreover, we studied the effect of the complete case analysis and multiple imputation on parameter estimates and confidence intervals. The outcome of this study aims to shed light on the development of missing data procedural knowledge and provide methodological support for public health decision-making when data with missing values are collected. Furthermore, this study aims to prevent the exclusion of missing data rather than to generate data. Methods A simulation study with 1000 replicates was performed. Four common statistical machine learning methods for handling missing values were included in this study. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-Means, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest (RF) imputations. Five clusters were used for KNN and K-mean. Likewise, five multiple imputations were used for the CART and RF methods. The simulation was based on publicly available data with available PHQ-8 data for 1096 subjects. In the simulation study and for each replication, multivariate missing values were generated using the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% proportions of missingness. The percent of depression was calculated using the PHQ-8 questionnaire and a comparison was made between estimated actual depression, complete-case analysis, KNN, Kmean, RF, and CART, respectively. Results The Median age of the subjects was 69 (interquartile range: 61–67) and more males (72.9%) than females were included in the data. The estimated actual depression was 16.8, whereas the estimated percentage of depression varies between 6.9–13.5, 16.2–16.7, 16.3–16.7, 16.6–16.7 and 16.7–16.8 for the complete case, KNN, Kmean, RF and CART respectively. Conclusion The results of this simulation study show that missing PHQ-8 data are best handled by applying multiple imputations based on CART or RF. However, using K-Means or KNN leads to a good estimate of the true percentage of depression. Furthermore, the results of this simulation study show that complete-case analysis leads to biased estimates of the true percentage of depression. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to address the problem of missing PHQ-8 data under the assumption of missing not at random.",BJPsych Open,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",7e6a8e7b-939b-4d19-af46-0878b11ff420,BJPsych Open,S172 - S172,10,N/A,2024,2024-06-01,0,0,"Khalid Suliman, M.

However, recent developments underscore the necessity of concurrent matching of interconnected schemas, termed schema alignment, to reconcile heterogeneous elements. This paper presents SchemaLogix, an innovative machine learning-based approach for schema matching. SchemaLogix addresses challenges such as data scarcity and domain-specific constraints through an inventive bootstrapping method, autonomously generating extensive datasets. Furthermore, SchemaLogix capitalizes on inherent alignment context constraints to optimize learning and improve precision across varied schema structures. Additionally, SchemaLogix incorporates user contributions to validate chosen correspondences, refining outputs based on valuable feedback. Empirical evaluations establish SchemaLogix's superiority over traditional methods, achieving an exceptional maximum S1 score of 0.90. These results offer practical insights for real-world applications, substantially advancing data integration and interoperability endeavors.",International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,journal,['JournalArticle'],20a3a2f3-532a-4f04-9f3d-1e268e100872,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,,0,29,"Mohamed Raoui, Mohammed Ennaouri, M.

Thus, data augmentation methods have been developed to improve classifiers by artificially created training data. In NLP, there is the challenge of establishing universal rules for text transformations which provide new linguistic patterns. In this paper, we present and evaluate a text generation method suitable to increase the performance of classifiers for long and short texts. We achieved promising improvements when evaluating short as well as long text tasks with the enhancement by our text generation method. Especially with regard to small data analytics, additive accuracy gains of up to 15.53% and 3.56% are achieved within a constructed low data regime, compared to the no augmentation baseline and another data augmentation technique. As the current track of these constructed regimes is not universally applicable, we also show major improvements in several real world low data tasks (up to +4.84 F1-score). Since we are evaluating the method from many perspectives (in total 11 datasets), we also observe situations where the method might not be suitable. We discuss implications and patterns for the successful application of our approach on different types of datasets.",International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,journal,['JournalArticle'],a0c45882-7c78-4f0c-8886-d3481ba02586,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,135 - 150,14,N/A,2021,2021-03-26,101,77,"Markus Bayer, M.

It requires manual design features, which consumes manpower and material resources, and identifies crops with a single type, and the results are bad. Therefore, to find an efficient and fast real-time disease image recognition method is very meaningful. Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that can automatically learn representative features to achieve better results in areas of image recognition. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use deep learning methods to identify crop pests and diseases and to find efficient and fast real-time image recognition methods of disease. Deep learning is a newly developed discipline in recent years. Its purpose is to study how to actively obtain a variety of feature representation methods from data samples and rely on data-driven methods, a series of nonlinear transformations are applied to finally collect the original data from specific to abstract, from general to specified semantics, and from low-level to high-level characteristic forms. This paper analyzes the classical and the latest neural network structure based on the theory of deep learning. For the problem that the network based on natural image classification is not suitable for crop pest and disease identification tasks, this paper has improved the network structure that can take care of both recognition speed and recognition accuracy. We discussed the influence of the crop pest and disease feature extraction layer on recognition performance. Finally, we used the inner layer as the main structure to be the pest and disease feature extraction layer by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the inner and global average pooling layers. We analyze various loss functions such as Softmax Loss, Center Loss, and Angular Softmax Loss for pest identification. In view of the shortcomings of difficulty in loss function training, convergence, and operation, making the distance between pests and diseases smaller and the distance between classes more greater improved the loss function and introduced techniques such as feature normalization and weight normalization. The experimental results show that the method can effectively enhance the characteristic expression ability of pests and diseases and thus improve the recognition rate of pests and diseases. Moreover, the method makes the pest identification network training simpler and can improve the pest and disease recognition rate better.",Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,journal,,501c1070-b5d2-4ff0-ad6f-8769a0a1e13f,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2021,2021-10-14,8,15,Yuanhui Yu,50133881,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00217041370fbc6f1b5cab5c1642f1a8162d6e6c,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science",50133881

Doppler lidar are hampered by several sources of uncertainty in the lidar
measurement, affecting both bias and random errors. Two problems encountered
especially for nacelle-mounted lidar are solid interference due to
intersection of the line of sight with solid objects behind, within, or in
front of the measurement volume and spectral noise due primarily to
limited photon capture. These two uncertainties, especially that due to
solid interference, can be reduced with high-fidelity retrieval techniques
(i.e., including both quality assurance/quality control and subsequent
parameter estimation). Our work compares three such techniques, including
conventional thresholding, advanced filtering, and a novel application of
supervised machine learning with ensemble neural networks, based on their
ability to reduce uncertainty introduced by the two observed nonideal
spectral features while keeping data availability high. The approach
leverages data from a field experiment involving a continuous-wave (CW)
SpinnerLidar from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) that provided
scans of a wide range of flows both unwaked and waked by a field turbine.
Independent measurements from an adjacent meteorological tower within the
sampling volume permit experimental validation of the instantaneous velocity
uncertainty remaining after retrieval that stems from solid interference and
strong spectral noise, which is a validation that has not been performed
previously. All three methods perform similarly for non-interfered returns,
but the advanced filtering and machine learning techniques perform better
when solid interference is present, which allows them to produce overall
standard deviations of error between 0.2 and 0.3 m s−1, or a 1 %–22 %
improvement versus the conventional thresholding technique, over the rotor
height for the unwaked cases. Between the two improved techniques, the
advanced filtering produces 3.5 % higher overall data availability, while
the machine learning offers a faster runtime (i.e., ∼ 1 s
to evaluate) that is therefore more commensurate with the requirements of
real-time turbine control. The retrieval techniques are described in terms
of application to CW lidar, though they are also relevant to pulsed lidar.
Previous work by the authors (Brown and Herges, 2020) explored a novel
attempt to quantify uncertainty in the output of a high-fidelity lidar
retrieval technique using simulated lidar returns; this article provides
true uncertainty quantification versus independent measurement and does so
for three techniques rather than one.

Research on public opinion in the field of machine learning usually focuses on micro-sentiment judgment, which is unable to offer support for the evaluation of public opinion events without additional data, and research from the perspective of artificial weighting has the disadvantage of the confusion of explanation. Judging the urgency of public opinion events is usually based on human perception, which is fuzzy and conforms to the attribute of fuzzy mathematics. Therefore, the index system in this paper was constructed in line with five principles, from which the weights were scientifically evaluated by integrating the DEMATEL and ANP model, and fuzzy mathematics was applied to determine the urgency level of public opinion. The result has three-fold significance. First, the index system constructed was more closely linked. Second, the integration of the DEMATEL and ANP weight calculating model took the interdependence of indicators fully into account. Third, fuzzy mathematics provided support for determining the public opinion crisis level, especially in the absence of immediate dissemination data.",Applied Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2023,2023-05-06,3,16,"Hua Wang, Ling Luo, Tao Liu","2155242880, 2114162969, 2149917006",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0022e5a46097180bf7c98c038c14d48631acb150,Computer Science,2155242880

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from proximal sensors and the high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provide an opportunity to monitor the crop water status efficiently. Based on data from an experimental tomato field with intensive aerial and plant-based measurements, we developed random forest machine learning regression models to estimate tomato stem water potential (ψ stem), (using observations from proximal sensors and 12-band UAV imagery, respectively, along with weather data. The proximal sensor-based model estimation agreed well with the plant ψ stem with R 2 of 0.74 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.63 bars. The model included PRI, normalized difference vegetation index, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature and tracked well with the seasonal dynamics of ψ stem across different plots. A separate model, built with multiple vegetation indices (VIs) from UAV imagery and weather variables, had an R 2 of 0.81 and MAE of 0.67 bars. The plant-level ψ stem maps generated from UAV imagery closely represented the water status differences of plots under different irrigation treatments and also tracked well the temporal change among flights. PRI was found to be the most important VI in both the proximal sensor- and the UAV-based models, providing critical information on tomato plant water status. This study demonstrated that machine learning models can accurately estimate the water status by integrating PRI, other VIs, and weather data, and thus facilitate data-driven irrigation management for processing tomatoes.",Frontiers in Plant Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],e110cc75-cd00-4b7f-968c-fd70b464a553,Frontiers in Plant Science,Unknown,14,N/A,2023,2023-04-06,6,87,"Zhehan Tang, Yufang Jin, P.

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a washing procedure that guarantees effective and safe cleaning. This organization recommends that States promote this activity and monitor it continuously. Based on this fact, this article presents a work oriented to study the feasibility of identifying the moments in which a person carried out a hand washing, determining its beginning and duration, as well as if these washings were compliant with the WHO guidelines. The identification of washing moments is made through the analysis, by means of Machine Learning techniques, of the data that can be collected from the inertial sensors of the smartwatch the person is wearing. This study was carried out with the participation of 15 volunteers. Data was not only collected in controlled settings but, also, more than 600 hours of sensor measurements come from free-live conditions. The results of the study showed that it is feasible to build a solid solution based on the use of low cost wearables for the identification of washing moments. The solution is very effective (with F1 over 95%) with user-dependent models. Also, with user-independent models, the identification of WHO washings is also very effective (with F1 above 85%), but more limited in the detection of free washings (F1 around 55%).",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,133574-133593,9,N/A,2021,,4,29,"Juan M.

This study retrospectively investigated newly diagnosed cases of MBNs from our laboratory to investigate mutation landscapes in Chinese patients with MBNs and to combine mutational information and machine learning (ML) into clinical applications for MBNs, especially for subtype classification. Methods Samples from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database were collected for ML model construction and cases from our laboratory were used for ML model validation. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation Random Forest algorithm was used for ML model construction. Mutation detection was performed by NGS and tumor cell size was confirmed by cell morphology and/or flow cytometry in our laboratory. Results Totally 849 newly diagnosed MBN cases from our laboratory were retrospectively identified and included in mutational landscape analyses. Patterns of gene mutations in a variety of MBN subtypes were found, important to investigate tumorigenesis in MBNs. A long list of novel mutations was revealed, valuable to both functional studies and clinical applications. By combining gene mutation information revealed by NGS and ML, we established ML models that provide valuable information for MBN subtype classification. In total, 8895 cases of 8 subtypes of MBNs in the COSMIC database were collected and utilized for ML model construction, and the models were validated on the 849 MBN cases from our laboratory. A series of ML models was constructed in this study, and the most efficient model, with an accuracy of 0.87, was based on integration of NGS testing and tumor cell sizes. Conclusions The ML models were of great significance in the differential diagnosis of all cases and different MBN subtypes.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stage of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this, we proposed a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. In general we have six machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, classifier and feed forward neural network to establish models. In existing system random forest achieved the performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. In proposed system, By analysing the misjudgments generated by the above model, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron which could achieve an efficient accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.

The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease’s onset.

The severity of MS disease is monitored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, composed of several functional sub-scores. Early and accurate classification of MS disease severity is critical for slowing down or preventing disease progression via applying early therapeutic intervention strategies. Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) create opportunities to apply data-driven and predictive modeling tools for this goal. Previous studies focusing on using single-modal machine learning and deep learning algorithms were limited in terms of prediction accuracy due to data insufficiency or model simplicity. In this paper, we proposed the idea of using patients’ multimodal longitudinal and longitudinal EHR data to predict multiple sclerosis disease severity in the future. Our contribution has two main facets. First, we describe a pioneering effort to integrate structured EHR data, neuroimaging data and clinical notes to build a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict patient’s MS severity. The proposed pipeline demonstrates up to 19% increase in terms of the area under the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) compared to models using single-modal data.

There is a major gap between a model that looks good on paper and a model that performs well in the drug discovery process. We are trying to shrink this gap by introducing the Evaluation Framework For predicting Efficiency of Cancer Treatment (EFFECT) benchmark suite based on the DepMap and GDSC data sets to facilitate the creation of well-applicable machine learning models capable of predicting gene essentiality and/or drug sensitivity on in vitro cancer cell lines. We show that standard evaluation metrics like Pearson correlation are misleading due to inherent biases in the data. Thus, to assess the performance of models properly, we propose the use of cell line/perturbation exclusive data splits, perturbation-wise evaluation, and the application of our Bias Detector framework, which can identify model predictions not explicable by data bias alone. Testing the EFFECT suite on a few popular machine learning (ML) models showed that while library-standard non-linear models have measurable performance in splits representing precision medicine and target identification tasks, the actual corrected correlations are rather low, showing that even simple knock-out (KO)/drug sensitivity prediction is a yet unsolved task.

Regional ethnic traditional sports are not only a sports business but also a tourism resource. The construction of a reasonable regional sports tourism resource classification model is fundamental to the development of sports tourism resources. However, the existing sports tourism resources classification is mostly constructed manually based on the national standard tourism resources classification system. The efficiency and accuracy of the traditional manual classification are poor and cannot reflect the characteristics of regional ethnic traditional sports tourism. In order to solve the above problems, a machine learning-based classification method for regional ethnic traditional sports tourism resources is proposed. Firstly, the relevant concepts and characteristics of traditional sports tourism resources are introduced. Then, taking the development of traditional sports of ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province as the research object, SWOT analysis, literature, interview, questionnaire, and mathematical statistics are used to investigate and analyse the overall status of the development of regional ethnic traditional sports. Secondly, a classification evaluation method based on an optimised back-propagation (BP) neural network is proposed. Finally, the optimised BP neural network model is applied to the classification of traditional sports tourism resources. The experimental results show that the optimised BP model performs well in the classification of traditional sports tourism resources, verifying its effectiveness.",Mobile Information Systems,journal,,6b6df2de-21bc-4137-9859-3fcef46f6a21,Mobile Information Systems,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2022,2022-08-21,4,35,"Cuihan Li, S.

The results of robust features were also compared with conventional techniques without considering the robustness of radiomic features. Methods An in-house developed lung phantom was developed with two 22mm lesion sizes based on a clinical study. A specific motor was built to simulate motion in two orthogonal directions. Lesions of both clinical and phantom studies were segmented using a Fuzzy C-means-based segmentation algorithm. After inducing motion and extracting 105 radiomic features in 4 feature sets, including shape, first-, second-, and higher-order statistics features from each region of interest (ROI) of the phantom image, statistical analyses were performed to select robust features against motion. Subsequently, these robust features and a total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from 126 clinical data. Various feature selection (FS) and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers were implemented to predict the LVI of NSCLC, followed by comparing the results of predicting LVI using robust features with common conventional techniques not considering the robustness of radiomic features. Results Our results demonstrated that selecting robust features as input to FS algorithms and ML classifiers surges the sensitivity, which has a gentle negative effect on the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) of predictions compared with commonly used methods in 12 of 15 outcomes. The top performance of the LVI prediction was achieved by the NB classifier and RFE FS without considering the robustness of radiomic features with 95% area under the curve of AUC, 67% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, the top performance of the LVI prediction using robust features belonged to the NB classifier and Boruta feature selection with 92% AUC, 86% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Conclusion Robustness over various influential factors is critical and should be considered in a radiomic study. Selecting robust features is a solution to overcome the low reproducibility of radiomic features. Although setting robust features against motion in a phantom study has a minor negative impact on the accuracy and AUC of LVI prediction, it boosts the sensitivity of prediction to a large extent.",Cancer Imaging,journal,['JournalArticle'],cff64e27-1d82-4bc4-9b24-1316078a9407,Cancer Imaging,Unknown,25,N/A,2025,2025-03-12,0,53,"Seyyed Ali Hosseini, G.

However, building a Machine learning model from scratch to classify Thai cultural images can be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data. In this study, we investigate the use of transfer learning for the task of image classification on a dataset of Thai cultural images. We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration. To better understand the reasoning behind the predictions made by the models, we deployed the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique to generate heatmaps that the models attend to when making predictions.

This is a difficult question that was addressed carefully in a recent paper that focused on the validity of the GRACE score to predict in-hospital mortality. (1) Why is this high-quality study by Mangariello and Gitelman important? Prediction models are increasingly published in the medical literature. Newer methods are proposed, such as labeled machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. Whatever the method of development, the key issue is whether the prediction model or algorithm provides valid predictions for physicians and their patients who rely on them as a source of information and decision making. Indeed, the authors rightly argue that many differences between settings may be present. These include differences in patient characteristics, healthcare systems, and socioeconomic environment. Moreover, treatment may change over time. All these differences may make a previously developed model not valid for the particular setting where the model is applied, for example the Dr. Juan A. Fernández Hospital in Buenos Aires. Therefore, a model may need updating for a specific setting.

First, to improve data quality, we preprocessed the data via interpolation and normalization. Next, to ensure the description integrity of model input, we extracted nine time-domain features based on the statistical characteristics of sEMG signals over time. Finally, we classified the samples using XGBoost and cross-validation (CV) and compared the results to those produced by the support vector machine (SVM) and the deep neural network (DNN).

Thirty percent of patients do not respond to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Sialylation is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosing CD and predicting anti-TNF medication outcomes in CD. Three potential biomarkers (SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2) were screened using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning based on sialylation-related genes. Moreover, the combined model of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 showed excellent diagnostic value in both the training and validation cohorts. Importantly, a Sial-score was constructed based on the expression of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2. The Sial-low group showed a lower level of immune infiltration than the Sial-high group. Anti-TNF therapy was effective for 94.4% of patients in the Sial-low group but only 15.8% in the Sial-high group. The Sial-score had an outstanding ability to predict and distinguish between responders and non-responders.

The Baekje weir in South Korea presents an interesting case as the weir has undergone full gate opening, which is generally not the case for weirs and reservoirs, providing valuable opportunity for simulating weir removal conditions. The main objectives are investigation of groundwater level fluctuations under various weir operations, distances from the weir, and seasonal variations. The study utilizes observed data that simulates conditions with and without the weir, including scenarios of full gate opening. Multiple machine learning algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—are used to develop accurate groundwater level prediction models. The models' performance is assessed using coefficient of determination, Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indices, and visualized through Taylor diagrams. Results indicate that XGBoost outperforms other models in all three groups during both training and testing phases. Specifically, XGBoost surpasses RF by 2.09% (R2), 5.66% (RMSE), and 10.1% (MAE) in training, and outperforms SVR by 11.2% (R2), 42.0% (RMSE), and 129.2% (MAE) in testing.

Although the human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied extensively in the last few decades, the in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose estimation problems. However, the in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes with specific challenges, including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout the day and having pose distribution different from the common human surveillance viewpoint. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly reduce the effectiveness of the existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge, the infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with the unconventional pose perspective, a 2- end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. The deep learning framework proves to be the most effective model in human pose estimation; however, the lack of large public dataset for in-bed poses prevents us from using a large network from scratch. In this paper, we explored the idea of employing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-tuning the model using our own shallow (limited in size and different in perspective and color) in-bed IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-trained CNN called convolutional pose machine (CPM) was fine-tuned for in-bed pose estimation by re-training its specific intermediate layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.",IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],5b1ab359-1a03-4a1b-b41d-332a3fbfd5b3,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,Unknown,7,N/A,2017,2017-11-03,58,44,"Shuangjun Liu, Yu Yin, S.

Clients who want to classify their data send them to a server that performs their inference using a trained model. The client must trust the server and provide the data in plaintext. Moreover, if the classification is done at a third-party cloud service, the model owner also needs to trust the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privately evaluating decision trees. The protocol uses a novel private comparison function based on fully homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) scheme and a programmable bootstrapping technique. Our comparison function for 32-bit and 64-bit integers is 26% faster than the naive TFHE implementation. The protocol is designed to be non-interactive and is less complex than the existing interactive protocols. Our experiment results show that our technique scales linearly with the depth of the decision tree and efficiently evaluates large decision trees on real datasets. Compared with the state of the art, ours is the only non-interactive protocol to evaluate a decision tree with high precision on encrypted parameters.

This study employs computational algorithms to automatically identify and classify features in X‐Ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy images. Principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian mixture (GM) clustering, are implemented to label features on a collection of XRF maps of human atherosclerotic plaque samples. The investigation involves the hard X‐Ray nanoprobe (NanoMAX) at MAX IV synchrotron radiation facility, utilizing scanning transmission X‐Ray microscopy (STXM) and XRF techniques. The analysis covers regions of interest scanned by the beam with a step size of 200 nm, yielding XRF maps of elements like calcium, iron, and zinc. These maps reveal intricate structures unsuitable for manual labeling. However, they can be accurately classified in an automated fashion using GM. Prior to clustering, PCA is used to deal with repeated patterns and background areas. The resulting clusters are associated with different types of features, which can be identified as specific tissues confirmed by histology.

Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are used to inform citizens about the political stances of the parties that involved in the upcoming elections, in an effort to facilitate their decision making process and increase their participation in this democratic process. VAA is a Web application that calls the users and parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, which are based on the current affairs of their country and then it recommends to each user the party that better fits their political views. SVAAs, a social recommendation approach of VAAs, on the other hand, base their recommendation on the VAA community of users in a collaborative filtering manner. In this paper we resort to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of SVAAs. In particular, we try to model party-supporters using HMMs and then use these models to recommend each VAA user the party whose model best fits his/her answer sequence of the VAA policy statements. HMMs proved to be effective machine learning tools for sequential and correlated data and this is the main rationale behind this study. VAA policy statements are usually correlated and grouped into categories such as external policy, economy, society, etc. As a result, opting from the various answer choices in each policy statement might be related with selections in previous and subsequent policy statements. Given that the order of policy statements is kept fixed within each VAA one can assume that (a) answer patterns (sequences of choices for all policy statements included in the VAA) can be found that characterise ‘typical’ voters of particular parties, and (b) the answer choice in each policy statement can be ‘predicted’ from previous answer choices.

Given the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges of employing children, young adults (18–40) can serve as suitable substitutes due to the similarity in their taste sensitivity. Taste panellists need not be experts in sensory evaluation so long as a reference product is used during evaluation; however, they should be screened for bitterness taste detection thresholds. For a more robust evaluation during the developmental phase, considerations of a scoring system and the calculation of an acceptance value may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of recommending a formulation for further development. On the technological front, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be exploited in taste-masking optimisation of medicinal formulations as they can model complex relationships between variables and enable predictions not possible previously to optimise product profiles. Machine learning classifiers may therefore tackle the challenge of predicting the bitterness intensity of paediatric formulations. While advancements have been made, further work is needed to identify effective taste-masking techniques for specific drug molecules. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms, using human panellist acceptability scores, can aid in enhancing paediatric formulation development and overcoming taste-masking challenges.",Pharmaceutics,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3c77be64-fcd3-444d-a98d-f563ab841a7e,Pharmaceutics,Unknown,15,N/A,2023,2023-08-01,4,54,"O.

Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid separation)–residue positions distant in sequence, but in close proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL::Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models folded was reduced by an average of 2 Å for a benchmark of 25 membrane proteins.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,12,N/A,2017,2017-05-24,5,45,"Pedro L Teixeira, Jeffrey L.

Methods A systematic search was conducted in ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts from July 2005 to May 2022. Machine learning approaches, including modified Lasso penalized regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were applied to identify hub ARGs, thereby developing a prediction model termed ARG classifier. Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the model was comprehensively analyzed using multi-transcriptome data. Subsequently, we systematically correlated the ARG classifier/hub ARGs with immunological characteristics of multiple aspects, including immune cell infiltration, immune and molecular pathways, cytokine levels, and immune-related genes. Further, we collected clinical specimens to preliminarily investigate ARG expression levels and to assess the diagnostic performance of ARG classifier. Results A total of ten GEO and three ArrayExpress datasets were included in this study. Based on machine learning algorithms, eight key ARGs (ATG4C, BAX, BIRC5, ERBB2, FKBP1B, HIF1A, NCKAP1, and NFKB1) were integrated to establish ARG classifier. The model exhibited excellent diagnostic values (AUC > 0.85) in multiple datasets and multiple points in time and superiorly distinguished sepsis from other critical illnesses. ARG classifier showed significant correlations with clinical characteristics or endotypes and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.70) than other clinical characteristics. Additionally, the identified hub ARGs were significantly associated with immune cell infiltration (B, T, NK, dendritic, T regulatory, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), immune and molecular pathways (inflammation-promoting pathways, HLA, cytolytic activity, apoptosis, type-II IFN response, complement and coagulation cascades), levels of several cytokines (PDGFRB, IL-10, IFNG, and TNF), which indicated that ARG classifier/hub ARGs adequately reflected the immune microenvironment during sepsis. Finally, using clinical specimens, the expression levels of key ARGs in patients with sepsis were found to differ significantly from those of control patients, and ARG classifier exhibited superior diagnostic performance, compared to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion Collectively, a diagnostic and prognostic model (ARG classifier) based on eight ARGs was developed which may assist clinicians in diagnosis of sepsis and recognizing patient at high risk to guide personalized treatment. Additionally, the ARG classifier effectively reflected the immune microenvironment diversity of sepsis and may facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",Journal of Inflammation Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],2264e13c-a38e-4a95-ad47-1fd698d3fc68,Journal of Inflammation Research,6165 - 6186,15,N/A,2022,2022-11-01,15,31,"Zhen Chen, Liming Zeng, Genglong Liu, Yangpeng Ou, Chuangang Lu, Ben Yang, Liuer Zuo","2117102276, 48973295, 2109614753, 12043454, 1677675795, 2163274691, 11909287",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028df26e5831b753f7ae8cdafb379cbd4e78165,"Computer Science, Medicine",2117102276

Previous studies have shown that endorsing conspiracy beliefs leads to lower protective guideline adherence (i.e., wearing face masks), posing a threat to public health measures. The current study expands this research across the lifespan, i.e., in a sample of adolescents with mental health problems. Here, we investigated the association between conspiracy beliefs and guideline adherence while also exploring the predictors of conspiracy beliefs. Methods N  = 93 adolescent psychiatric outpatients (57% female, mean age: 15.8) were assessed using anonymous paper–pencil questionnaires. Endorsement of generic and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was assessed, in addition to items measuring adherence to protective guidelines and mental health (stress, depressive symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and adverse childhood experiences). Multiple regressions and supervised machine learning (conditional random forests) were used for analyses. Results Fourteen percent of our sample fully endorsed at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory, while protective guidelines adherence was relatively high ( M  = 4.92, on a scale from 1 to 7). The endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs—but not of generic conspiracy beliefs—was associated with lower guideline adherence (β = − 0.32, 95% CI − 0.53 to − 0.11, p  < .001). Conditional random forests suggested that adverse childhood experiences and peer and conduct problems were relevant predictors of both conspiracy belief categories. Conclusion While a significant proportion of our sample of adolescents in psychiatric treatment endorsed conspiracy beliefs, the majority did not. Furthermore, and to some degree, contrary to public perception, we found that adolescents show relatively good adherence to public health measures—even while experiencing a high degree of mental distress. The predictive value of adverse childhood experiences and peer/conduct problems for conspiracy beliefs might be explained by compensatory mechanisms to ensure the safety, structure, and inclusion that conspiracies provide.",Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],12be30c9-5ddf-49b3-bed9-d9fe5fcd9a19,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,Unknown,17,N/A,2023,2023-01-24,2,69,"Andreas Goreis, Bettina Pfeffer, H.

We find that both neural networks that incorporate distance within the jet as an input and boosted decision trees including radial distance information can provide significant improvement in jet charge extraction over current methods. Specifically, convolutional, recurrent, and recursive networks can provide the largest improvement over traditional methods, in part by effectively utilizing distance within the jet or clustering history.

Considering the countless impacts of human activity on persons' everyday life, we have analyzed the correlation between human activity and their product preferences in our study and proposed that daily human activity could be a metric for product recommendation models. To address this previously unaccounted phenomenon, a new approach is presented in our study that gives real-time recommendations to users by observing their activeness in daily life. However, product recommendation systems mostly believe in ratings, and the purchase behavior of users instead of investigating the precious insights of users' daily activities. But we examined smartphones' GPS sensor data using machine learning algorithms to urge insights from users' daily activeness and proposed a model for predicting the product of interest of the purchasers, based on the activeness of their daily life. Moreover, based on our model, we have introduced a prototype of a real-time recommendation system, especially for the retail shops that rely on users' implicit data from smartphone sensors to form product recommendations. For conducting our study, we developed an android application that—collects embedded smartphone sensor data and can detect objects to provide product recommendations and product details.

However finding effective solution to these problems has been rendered difficult. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents an analytical Machine learning model that suitably combined the graph signature with random forest techniques. This study presents the design and realization of a novel Intelligent Citizenship Identity through family pedigree using Graph Signature based random forest (GSB-RF) model. The study also showcases the development of a novel graph signature technique referred to as Canonical Code Signature(CCS) method. The CCS method is used at the pre-processing stage of the identification process to build signature for any given tuple. Performance comparisim between the present system and the baseline techniques which includes: the K-Nearest Neighbour and the traditional Random Forest shows that the present system outperformed the baseline method studied. The proposed system shows capability to perform continuous re-identification of Citizens based on their family pedigree with ability to select best sample with low computational complexity, high identification accuracy and speed. Our experimental result shows that the precision rate and identification quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%.

Especially as the number of variables in real-world medical data increases, causal discovery becomes more and more effective. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop new causal discovery algorithms suitable for small data sets for situations where sample sizes are insufficient to detect reasonable causal relationships, such as rare diseases and emerging infectious diseases. This study aims to develop a new causal discovery algorithm suitable for a small number of real-world medical data using quantum computing, one of the emerging information technologies attracting attention for its application in machine learning. In this study, a new algorithm that applies the quantum kernel to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, one of the causal discovery algorithms, is developed. Experiments on several artificial data sets showed that the new algorithm proposed in this study was more accurate than existing methods with the Gaussian kernel under various conditions in the low-data regime. When the new algorithm was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which the causal structure could be correctly estimated even when the amount of data was small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing the new algorithm on real quantum hardware was discussed. This study suggests that the new proposed algorithm using quantum computing might be a good choice among the causal discovery algorithms in the low-data regime for novel medical knowledge discovery.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLOS ONE,Unknown,18,N/A,2021,2021-10-09,6,44,H.

Unfortunately, traditional Signature‐based IDSs (SIDSs) perform poorly against previously unseen adversarial attacks. Anomaly‐based IDSs (AIDSs) use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to overcome these limitations. However, AIDS performance can be poor when trained on imbalanced datasets. To address the challenge of AIDS performance caused by these unbalanced training datasets, generative adversarial models are proposed to obtain adversarial attacks from one side and analyse their quality from another. According to extensive usage and reliability criteria for generative adversarial models in different disciplines, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) are employed to serve AIDS. The authors have extensively assessed their abilities and robustness to deliver high‐quality attacks for AIDS. AIDSs are constructed, trained, and tuned based on these models to measure their impacts. The authors have employed two datasets: NSL‐KDD and CICIDS‐2017 for generalisation purposes, where ML and DL approaches are utilised to implement AIDSs. Their results show that the WGAN model outperformed GANs and BiGAN models in binary and multiclass classifications for both datasets.",IET Networks,conference,['JournalArticle'],22af107a-3e64-455e-92c6-82141a5a7e6a,IET Networks,28-44,13,201922af107a-3e64-455e-92c6-82141a5a7e6a,2023,2023-08-28,6,15,"Mohammad Arafah, Iain W.

Our system uses a dual Doppler radar mounted onto a restroom ceiling and wall. Machine learning methods, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, support vector machine, and random forest methods, are applied to the Doppler radar data to verify the model’s efficiency and features. Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom. These findings indicate that daily restroom monitoring using the proposed radar system accurately recognizes human behaviors and allows early detection of fall accidents.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,22,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-02-22,18,41,"K.

Despite the overwhelming QCD background, recent advances in jet substructure have put the observation of the gg→H→bb¯$$ gg\to H\to b\overline{b} $$ channel at the LHC within the realm of possibility. In order to enhance the sensitivity to this process, we develop a two-stream convolutional neural network, with one stream acting on jet information and one using global event properties. The neural network significantly increases the discovery potential of a Higgs signal, both for high-pT Standard Model production as well for possible beyond the Standard Model contributions. Unlike most studies for boosted hadronically decaying massive particles, the boosted Higgs search is unique because double b-tagging rejects nearly all background processes that do not have two hard prongs. In this context — which goes beyond state-of-the-art two-prong tagging — the network is studied to identify the origin of the additional information leading to the increased significance. The procedures described here are also applicable to related final states where they can be used to identify additional sources of discrimination power that are not being exploited by current techniques.",Journal of High Energy Physics,journal,,cb5c6d2c-8c82-406e-b42e-b691561f3e4e,Journal of High Energy Physics,1-25,2018,N/A,2018,2018-07-27,28,111,"J.

Methods After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. Results This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm explains the individualized predictions. Conclusions In conclusion, our study accomplished the successful development and validation of ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with CHF combined with CKD.

Tumors in different organs can share molecular features, while those in the same organ can be heterogeneous. This disconnect impacts clinical trials, drug development, and patient care. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning, offer promising avenues for reclassifying cancers through comprehensive integration of molecular, histopathological, imaging, and clinical characteristics. AI‐driven approaches have the potential to reveal novel cancer subtypes, identify new prognostic variables, and guide more precise treatment strategies for improving patient outcomes.",Clinical and Translational Science,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3286b810-5251-4142-a03d-c7c20b90fd89,Clinical and Translational Science,Unknown,17,N/A,2024,2024-08-29,1,16,Sean Khozin,2318270439,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002cc9e3f3d43d08403170cef089728abeba33b7,"Computer Science, Medicine",2318270439

The iCPH platform combines humanoid robots as “physical twins” of human and “digital twins” that simulates humans and robots in cyber-space. Several critical research topics are introduced to address this challenge by leveraging the advanced model-based analysis together with data-driven learning to exploit collected data from the integrated platform of iCPH. Definition of general description is identified as the first topic as a common basis of contact motions compatible to both humans and humanoids. Then, we set continual learning of a feasible contact motion network as the second challenge by benefiting from model-based approach and machine learning bridged by the efficient analytical gradient computation developed by the author and his collaborators. The final target is to establish a high-level symbolic system allowing automatic understanding and generation of contact motions in unexperienced environments.

When an object is placed on the metasurface, local changes can be detected in one or more of the structure’s meta-atoms. This interaction generally modifies the inductance of the meta-atom, resulting in changes to the overall input impedance of the surface. We derive the properties of the structure and its behaviour in terms of superposition and demonstrate that observing the meta-surface from a single point is sufficient for unambiguous localisation and identification. To model these changes effectively and identify the position of an object, we employ a neural network machine learning algorithm.

It creates an adverse impact on flyrock. Thus, it is essential to forecast flyrock to minimize the environmental effects. The objective of this study is to forecast/estimate the amount of flyrock produced during blasting by applying three creative composite intelligent models: equilibrium optimizer-coupled extreme learning machine (EO-ELM), particle swarm optimization-based extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). To obtain a successful conclusion, we considered 114 blasting data parameters consisting of eight inputs (hole diameter, burden, stemming length, rock density, charge-per-meter, powder factor (PF), blastability index (BI), and weathering index), and one output parameter (flyrock distance). We then compared the results of different models using seven different performance indices. Every predictive model accomplished the results comparable with the measured values of flyrock. To show the effectiveness of the developed EO-ELM, the result from each model run 10-times is compared. The average result shows that the EO-ELM model in testing (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 32.14, MAE = 19.78, MAPE = 20.37, NSE = 0.93, VAF = 93.97, A20 = 0.57) achieved a better performance as compared to the PSO-ANN model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 64.44, MAE = 36.02, MAPE = 29.96, NSE = 0.72, VAF = 74.72, A20 = 0.33) and PSO-ELM model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 48.55, MAE = 26.97, MAPE = 26.71, NSE = 0.84, VAF = 84.84, A20 = 0.51). Further, a non-parametric test is performed to assess the performance of these three models developed. It shows that the EO-ELM performed better in the prediction of flyrock compared to PSO-ELM and PSO-ANN. We did sensitivity analysis by introducing a new parameter, WI.

We present outcome (‘recovered’, ‘isolated’ or ‘death’) risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over ‘early’ datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used ‘country’, ‘age’ and ‘gender’ as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient’s ‘disease’ history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results The use of a patient’s ‘disease’ history improves the prediction of ‘death’ by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent’s ‘disease’ history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient’s ‘disease’ history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions.

Therefore, it is vital to predict NAO events. Since the NAO event can be quantified by the NAO index, an effective neural network model EEMD-ConvLSTM, which is based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), is proposed for NAO index prediction in this paper. EEMD is applied to preprocess NAO index data, which are issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NAO index data are decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). After being filtered by the energy threshold, the remaining IMFs are used to reconstruct new NAO index data as the input of ConvLSTM. In order to evaluate the performance of EEMD-ConvLSTM, six methods were selected as the benchmark, which included traditional models, machine learning algorithms, and other deep neural networks. Furthermore, we forecast the NAO index with EEMD-ConvLSTM and the Rolling Forecast (RF) and compared the results with those of Global Forecast System (GFS) and the averaging of 11 Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model ensemble members (ENSM) provided by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. The experimental results show that EEMD-ConvLSTM not only has the highest reliability from evaluation metrics, but also can better capture the variation trend of the NAO index data.",Atmosphere,journal,,0a6835b2-217d-4708-8735-f574a583a7d7,Atmosphere,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2019,2019-05-07,27,32,"Shijin Yuan, Xiaodan Luo, Bin Mu, Jing Li, G.

Mining of symbolic data is more difficult than numerical data due to the lack of inherent geometric properties of this type of data. In this paper, we use two kinds of kernel learning methods to create a kernel estimation model and a nonlinear classification algorithm for symbolic data. By using the kernel smoothing method, we construct a squared-error consistent probability estimator for symbolic data, followed by a new data transformation model proposed to embed symbolic data into Euclidean space. Based on the model, the inner product and distance measure between symbolic data objects are reformulated, allowing a new Support Vector Machine (SVM), called SVM-S, to be defined for nonlinear classification on symbolic data using the Mercer kernel learning method. The experiment results show that SVM can be much more effective for symbolic data classification based on our proposed model and measures.","Soft Computing - A Fusion of Foundations, Methodologies and Applications",journal,['JournalArticle'],32505816-936f-497d-8f3c-ee241a290329,Soft Computing,1249 - 1259,26,N/A,2021,2021-10-25,1,52,"Xuanhui Yan, Lifei Chen, G.

Although different solutions have been exercised against phishing, phishing attacks have dramatically increased in the past few years. Recent studies have shown that machine learning has become prominent in the present anti-phishing context, and the techniques like deep learning have extensively improved anti-phishing tools’ detection ability. This paper proposes PhishDet, a new way of detecting phishing websites through Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network and Graph Convolutional Network using URL and HTML features. PhishDet is the first of its kind, which uses the powerful analysis and processing capabilities of Graph Neural Network in the anti-phishing domain and recorded 96.42% detection accuracy, with a 0.036 false-negative rate. It is effective against zero-day attacks, and the average detection time which is 1.8 seconds could also be considered realistic. The feature selection of PhishDet is automatic and occurs inside the system, as PhishDet gradually learns URLs and HTML content features to handle constantly changing phishing attacks. This has outperformed similar solutions by achieving a 99.53% f1-score with a public benchmark dataset. However, PhishDet requires periodic retraining to maintain its performance over time. If such retraining could be facilitated, PhishDet could fight against phishers for a more extended period to safeguard Internet users from this Internet threat.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,82355-82375,10,N/A,2022,,23,70,"Subhash Ariyadasa, S.

This approach is based on the fact that at a given EFT order, the full angular distribution in the most important electroweak processes can be expressed as a sum of a fixed number of basis functions. The coefficients of these basis functions — the so-called angular moments — and their energy dependance, thus form an ideal set of experimental observables that encapsulates the complete multi-dimensional differential information of the process. This approach is generic and the observables constructed allow to avoid blind directions in the SMEFT parameter space. While this method is applicable to many of the important electroweak processes, as a first example we study the pp → V(ℓℓ)h(bb) process (V ≡ Z/W±, ℓℓ ≡ ℓ+ℓ−/ℓ±ν), including QCD NLO effects, differentially. We show that using the full differential data in this way plays a crucial role in simultaneously and maximally constraining the different vertex structures of the Higgs coupling to gauge bosons.

To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit. In comparison with other similar types of models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF), the classification accuracy of JMLA is 97.9% on the train set. The accuracy rate on the test set reached 97.6%. The results of the research demonstrate that JMLA can improve the accuracy of the glass type classification problem, greatly enhance the research efficiency of archaeological staff, and gain a more reliable result.",Applied Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2023,2023-05-30,4,70,"Zhi-Xing Li, Pengsen Lu, Guang-Yan Wang, Jia-Hui Li, Zhen-Hao Yang, Yunpeng Ma, Hong-Hai Wang","2218899393, 2214180256, 2152582807, 2218880417, 2029319614, 2218675820, 2196698773",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0032ae42a28ed484aa7440742767b0e9e9a7dcff,"History, Materials Science",2218899393

With huge success and diverse benefits, the paradigm faces several challenges as well. Power consumption, dynamic resource scaling, and over- and under-provisioning issues are challenges for the cloud computing paradigm. The research has been carried out in cloud computing for resource utilization prediction to overcome over- and under-provisioning issues. Over-provisioning of resources consumes more energy and leads to high costs. However, under-provisioning induces Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and Quality of Service (QoS) degradation. Most of the existing mechanisms focus on single resource utilization prediction, such as memory, CPU, storage, network, or servers allocated to cloud applications but overlook the correlation among resources. This research focuses on multi-resource utilization prediction using Functional Link Neural Network (FLNN) with hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs’ chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed. The dataset and code used are publicly available on Mendeley Data and GitHub, respectively.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLOS ONE,Unknown,18,N/A,2023,2023-06-21,8,57,"Marinara Marcato, Salvatore Tedesco, C.

 With the emerging developments in millimeter-wave/5G technologies, the potential for wireless Internet of things devices to achieve widespread sensing, precise localization, and high data-rate communication systems becomes increasingly viable. The surge in interest surrounding virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies is attributed to the vast array of applications they enable, ranging from surgical training to motion capture and daily interactions in VR spaces. To further elevate the user experience, and real-time and accurate orientation detection of the user, the authors proposes the utilization of a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system coupled with an ultra-low-power, sticker-like millimeter-wave identification (mmID). The mmID features four backscattering elements, multiplexed in amplitude, frequency, and spatial domains. This design utilizes the training of a supervised learning classification convolutional neural network, enabling accurate real-time three-axis orientation detection of the user. The proposed orientation detection system exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 90.58% over three axes at a distance of 8 m. This high accuracy underscores the precision of the orientation detection system, particularly tailored for medium-range VR/AR applications. The integration of the FMCW-based mmID system with machine learning proves to be a promising advancement, contributing to the seamless and immersive interaction within virtual and augmented environments.",International journal of microwave and wireless technologies,journal,['JournalArticle'],976d9362-f9c5-46d8-b219-e34993ab000d,International Journal of Microwave and Wireless Technologies,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,2024-11-13,0,3,"Marvin Joshi, Charles A.

The emergence and/or worsening of chronic pain are known sequelae of IPV; however, not all those who experience IPV develop chronic pain. To mitigate its development, it is critical to identify the factors that are associated with increased risk of pain after IPV. This proof-of-concept study used machine-learning strategies to predict pain severity and interference in 47 young women, ages 18 to 30, who experienced an incident of IPV (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) within three months of their baseline assessment. Young women are more likely than men to experience IPV and to subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Women completed a comprehensive assessment of theory-driven cognitive and neurobiological predictors of pain severity and pain-related interference (e.g., pain, coping, disability, psychiatric diagnosis/symptoms, PTSD/trauma, executive function, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress response). Gradient boosting machine models were used to predict symptoms of pain severity and pain-related interference across time (Baseline, 1-,3-,6- follow-up assessments). Models showed excellent predictive performance for pain severity and adequate predictive performance for pain-related interference. This proof-of-concept study suggests that machine-learning approaches are a useful tool for identifying predictors of pain development in survivors of recent IPV. Baseline measures of pain, family life impairment, neuropsychological function, and trauma history were of greatest importance in predicting pain and pain-related interference across a 6-month follow-up period. Present findings support the use of machine-learning techniques in larger studies of post-IPV pain development and highlight theory-driven predictors that could inform the development of targeted early intervention programs. However, these results should be replicated in a larger dataset with lower levels of missing data.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,16,N/A,2021,2021-07-29,5,90,"E.

Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14 months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000 cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis.

However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume. The findings contribute to our understanding of onabotulinumA injection treatment for OAB and support evidence-based decision-making using readily available information.",Cureus,journal,['JournalArticle'],87c855fc-c59a-4443-832a-e5b1ca14b9f3,Cureus,Unknown,15,N/A,2023,2023-07-01,4,27,"N.

Although the body of work in privacy has been steadily growing over the past few years, research on the privacy aspects of machine learning has received less focus than the security aspects. Our contribution in this research is an analysis of more than 45 papers related to privacy attacks against machine learning that have been published during the past seven years. We propose an attack taxonomy, together with a threat model that allows the categorization of different attacks based on the adversarial knowledge, and the assets under attack. An initial exploration of the causes of privacy leaks is presented, as well as a detailed analysis of the different attacks.

Although formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are deemed crucial for research and clinical applications, the fixation process results in molecular damage to nucleic acids, thus confounding their use in genome sequence analysis. Methods to improve genomic data quality from FFPE tissues have emerged, but there remains significant room for improvement. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from matched Fresh Frozen (FF) and FFPE tissue samples to optimize a sensitive and precise FFPE single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling approach. We present methods to reduce the prevalence of false-positive SNVs by applying combinatorial techniques to five publicly available variant callers. We also introduce FFPolish, a novel variant classification method that efficiently classifies FFPE-specific false-positive variants.

The genetic association signals between 5-HTTLPR and psychiatric phenotypes, however, have been inconsistent across many studies. Since the polymorphism cannot be tested via available SNP arrays, we had previously proposed an efficient machine learning algorithm to predict the genotypes of 5-HTTLPR based on the genotypes of eight nearby SNPs, which requires access to individual-level genotype and phenotype data. To utilize the advantage of publicly available GWAS summary statistics obtained from studies with very large sample sizes, we develop a GWAS summary-statistics-based approach for testing the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) associations with various phenotypes. We first cross-verify the accuracy of the summary-statistics-based approach for 61 phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Since we observed a strong similarity between the predicted individual-level 5-HTTLPR genotype-based approach and the summary-statistics-based approach, we applied our method to the available neurobehavioral GWAS summary statistics data obtained from large-scale GWAS. We found no genome-wide significant evidence for association between 5-HTTLPR and any of the neurobehavioral traits.

However, some of these algorithms are inscrutable, namely, they produce predictions that humans cannot understand or explain. This trait is in tension with the emphasis on reason‐giving in administrative law. The article explores this tension, advancing two interrelated arguments. First, providing adequate reasons is a significant facet of respecting individuals’ agency. Incorporating inscrutable algorithmic predictions into administrative decision‐making compromises this normative ideal. Second, as a long‐term concern, the use of inscrutable algorithms by administrative agencies may generate systemic effects by gradually reducing the realm of the humanly explainable in public life, a phenomenon Max Weber termed ‘re‐enchantment’. As a result, the use of inscrutable machine learning algorithms might trigger a special kind of re‐enchantment, making us comprehend less rather than more of shared human experience, and consequently altering the way we understand the administrative state and experience public life.",Modern law review,journal,['JournalArticle'],2cba0d8a-bec0-49e1-bf6e-6cd5f329fe73,The Modern Law Review,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2023,2023-10-08,1,0,"Eden Sarid, Omri Ben-Zvi","153899576, 1412373604",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003ac96deaefc09dee4446f9c10554fb09f6fba7,"Computer Science, Law, Political Science",153899576

The Jucazinho Dam, built in 1998, emerged as a response to the scarcity of water in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil. After having less than 1% of its water storage capacity in 2016, the dam recovered in 2020 after interventions by the local water utility. In this context, the reliability of influent flow prediction models for dams becomes crucial for managers. This study proposed hydrological models based on artificial intelligence that aim to generate flow series, and we evaluated the adaptability of these models for the operation of the Jucazinho Dam. Data normalization between 0 and 1 was applied to avoid the predominance of variables with high values. The model was based on machine learning and employed support vector regression (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), as provided by the Python Sklearn library. The selection of the monitoring stations took place via the Brazilian National Water and Sanitation Agency’s (ANA) HIDROWEB portal, and we used Spearman’s correlation to identify the relationship between precipitation and flow. The evaluation of the performance of the model involved graphical analyses and statistical criteria such as the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the percentage of bias (PBIAS), the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean standard deviation ratio (RSR). The results of the statistical coefficients for the test data indicated unsatisfactory performance for long-term predictions (8, 16 and 32 days ahead), revealing a downward trend in the quality of the fit with an increase in the forecast horizon. The SVM model stood out by obtaining the best indices of NSE, PBIAS, R2 and RSR. The graphical results of the SVM models showed underestimation of the flow values with an increase in the forecast horizon due to the sensitivity of the SVM to complex patterns in the time series. On the other hand, the RF and ANN models showed hyperestimation of the flow values as the number of forecast days increased, which was mainly attributed to overfitting. In summary, this study highlights the relevance of artificial intelligence in flow prediction for the efficient management of dams, especially in water scarcity and data-scarce scenarios. A proper choice of models and the ensuring of reliable input data are crucial for obtaining accurate forecasts and can contribute to water security and the effective operation of dams such as Jucazinho.",Hydrology,journal,['JournalArticle'],5dc07f39-44b5-44be-b79f-081977809832,Hydrology,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2024,2024-07-04,2,17,"Erickson Johny Galindo da Silva, Artur Paiva Coutinho, Jean Firmino Cardoso, Saulo de Tarso Marques Bezerra","2310193780, 2253481515, 2310050405, 94014125",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003b1449565f0afd675b7fb59f35693776eb2c77,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",2310193780

Machine learning can be used in many applications such as face detection, speech recognition, medical diagnostics, statistical arbitrage, traffic prediction, etc. The traffic environment includes everything that can affect traffic on the road, whether it is traffic lights, accidents, rallies, or even road repairs that can cause congestion. If we have preconceived information very close to all of the above and the many everyday situations that can affect traffic, the driver or passenger can make an informed decision. It also helps with the future of automotive vehicles. In the present decades, traffic data has been massively generated, and we have moved towards big data concepts for transportation. The to be had site visitors glide forecasting strategies use a few site visitors’ prediction fashions and are nonetheless unsatisfactory to address real-global applications. It is lumbering to figure out the traffic flow precisely since the information accessible for the transportation framework is madly colossal. In this work, we arranged to utilize machine learning, genetic, soft computing, and deep learning algorithms to analyse the big-data for the transportation system with much-reduced complexity. Moreover, Image Processing algorithms are included in traffic sign recognition, which inevitably helps for the right training of autonomous vehicles. In economic years, Mobility GPS has become very popular in big cities in determining traffic percentage with the help of centralized traffic - server management.

A complex system has diverse observation features and complex internal structures, which have been difficult to study with regard to health condition estimation. To describe continuous and gradually changing time-based characteristics of a complex system’s health condition, this study develops a feature selection model based on the information amount and stability. Then, a reliability tree analysis model is designed according to the selected relevant features, the reliability tree is developed using expert knowledge, and the node weight is calculated by the correlation coefficient generated during the feature selection process. Using the simple recurrent unit (SRU), which is a time series machine learning algorithm that achieves a high operating efficiency, the results of the reliability tree analysis are combined to establish a tree-structure SRU (T-SRU) model for complex system health condition estimation. Finally, NASA turbofan engine data are used for verification.

The instruments used so far for dietary monitoring (eg, food frequency questionnaires, food diaries, and telephone interviews) are inexpensive and easy to implement but show important inaccuracies. Alternative methods based on wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated from these types of devices. Objective This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable estimate of caloric intake. Methods The study will capture four individual eating activities outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email, flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the University of Padova. Results The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high accuracy. Conclusions Building an automatic calculation method for caloric intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg, for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different segments of the population.

Due to the limitations of current diagnostic tools in these cases, novel approaches must be brought forward to improve treatment outcomes for these patients. The objective of this study was to develop a machine-learning-based software for primary cancer site prediction (OncoOrigin), based on genetic data acquired from tumor DNA sequencing. By design, this was an in silico diagnostic study, conducted using data from the cBioPortal database (accessed on 21 September 2024) and several data processing and machine learning Python libraries. The study involved over 20,000 tumor samples with information on patient age, sex, and the presence of genetic variants in over 600 genes. The main outcome of interest was machine-learning-based discrimination between cancer site classes. Model quality was assessed by training set cross-validation and evaluation on a segregated test set. Finally, the optimal model was incorporated with a graphical user interface into the OncoOrigin software. Feature importance for class discrimination was also determined on the optimal model. Out of the four tested machine learning estimators, the XGBoostClassifier-based model proved superior in test set evaluation, with a top-2 accuracy of 0.91 and ROC-AUC of 0.97. Unlike other machine learning models published in the literature, OncoOrigin stands out as the only one integrated with a graphical user interface, which is crucial for facilitating its use by oncology specialists in everyday clinical practice, where its application and implementation will have the greatest value in the future.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,Unknown,26,N/A,2025,2025-03-01,0,38,"P.

Despite the growing knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction and ulcerative colitis (UC), the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in UC remains to be fully explored. Methods We integrated 1137 UC colon mucosal samples from 12 multicenter cohorts worldwide to create a normalized compendium. Differentially expressed mitochondria-related genes (DE-MiRGs) in individuals with UC were identified using the “Limma” R package. Unsupervised consensus clustering was utilized to determine the intrinsic subtypes of UC driven by DE-MiRGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to investigate module genes related to UC. Four machine learning algorithms were utilized for screening DE-MiRGs in UC and construct MiRGs diagnostic models. The models were developed utilizing the over-sampled training cohort, followed by validation in both the internal test cohort and the external validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Xcell and CIBERSORT algorithms, while potential biological mechanisms were explored through GSVA and GSEA algorithms. Hub genes were selected using the PPI network. Results The study identified 108 DE-MiRGs in the colonic mucosa of patients with UC compared to healthy controls, showing significant enrichment in pathways associated with mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation. The MiRGs diagnostic models for UC were constructed based on 17 signature genes identified through various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities. Utilizing the identified DE-MiRGs from the normalized compendium, 941 patients with UC were stratified into three subtypes characterized by distinct cellular and molecular profiles. Specifically, the metabolic subtype demonstrated enrichment in epithelial cells, the immune-inflamed subtype displayed high enrichment in antigen-presenting cells and pathways related to pro-inflammatory activation, and the transitional subtype exhibited moderate activation across all signaling pathways. Importantly, the immune-inflamed subtype exhibited a stronger correlation with superior response to four biologics: infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and golimumab compared to the metabolic subtype. Conclusion This analysis unveils the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune microenvironment in UC, thereby offering novel perspectives on the potential pathogenesis of UC and precision treatment of UC patients, and identifying new therapeutic targets.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,Unknown,15,N/A,2024,2024-07-04,1,77,"Yi-fan Zhang, Meng-ying Fan, Qi-rui Bai, Rong Zhao, Shan Song, Li Wu, Jun-hui Lu, Jing-wei Liu, Qi Wang, Yuan Li, Xing Chen","2270958682, 2309982371, 2310040392, 2266167149, 2310320981, 2161944199, 2310188122, 2309962147, 2310246652, 2310440004, 2271219376",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e31ab99c90e5720ecd5fd6d74e672b887876c,"Biology, Environmental Science, Medicine",2270958682

Tumors can have devastating implications if not accurately and promptly detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the methods frequently used to detect brain tumors owing to its excellent resolution. In the past few decades, substantial research has been conducted in the field of classifying brain images, ranging from traditional methods to deep-learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). To accomplish classification, machine-learning methods require manually created features. In contrast, CNN achieves classification by extracting visual features from unprocessed images. The size of the training dataset had a significant impact on the features that CNN extracts. The CNN tends to overfit when its size is small. Deep CNNs (DCNN) with transfer learning have therefore been developed. The aim of this work was to investigate the brain MR image categorization potential of pre-trained DCNN VGG-19, VGG-16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 models using data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Validation of the test set utilizing accuracy, recall, Precision, and F1 score showed that the pre-trained VGG-19 model with transfer learning exhibited the best performance.

Despite its widespread use across various fields, the extreme learning machine (ELM) also suffers from multicollinearity issues. To address this challenge, the ridge and Liu estimators, drawn from statistics literature, have been integrated into ELM theory, resulting in a notable advancement. This study aims to further enhance the capabilities of ridge and Liu estimators within the ELM framework by introducing two innovative two-parameter algorithms (TP1-ELM and TP2-ELM) that simultaneously incorporate both estimators. The proposed algorithms undergo comprehensive benchmarking against ELM, ELM-based algorithms, and other commonly used machine learning techniques across seven diverse datasets. Benchmark results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform both ELM-focused approaches and traditional machine learning algorithms on most datasets, yielding more generalizable and stable results. These findings suggest that the proposed algorithms offer a promising alternative to traditional machine learning techniques for regression and classification tasks, particularly in scenarios where multicollinearity is a concern.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,102355-102367,12,N/A,2024,,0,68,Hasan Yıldırım,2238706836,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003fb578fc586082308689f125933f28cc5debc6,"Computer Science, Mathematics",2238706836

Validation of the algorithms and outcome measures used by mHealth apps is of paramount importance, as poorly validated apps have been found to be harmful to patients. Falls are a complex, common and costly problem in the older adult population. Deficits in balance and postural control are strongly associated with falls risk. Assessment of balance and falls risk using a validated smartphone app may lessen the need for clinical assessments which can be expensive, requiring non-portable equipment and specialist expertise. This study reports results for the real-world deployment of a smartphone app for self-directed, unsupervised assessment of balance and falls risk. The app relies on a previously validated algorithm for assessment of balance and falls risk; the outcome measures employed were trained prior to deployment on an independent data set. Results for a sample of 594 smartphone assessments from 147 unique phones show a strong association between self-reported falls history and the falls risk and balance impairment scores produced by the app, suggesting they may be clinically useful outcome measures. In addition, analysis of the quantitative balance features produced seems to suggest that unsupervised, self-directed assessment of balance in the home is feasible.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Unknown,21,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-07-01,20,40,"B.

As the sophistication of malware continues to increase, the demand for innovative approaches to improve detection capabilities become paramount. Machine learning/Deep learning models are being increasingly used for Malware Detection, however one of the most important and frequently overlooked aspects of building such models is feature encoding. This research paper explores the importance of feature encoding to improve the efficiency of threat detection and proposes a novel entropy-based encoding scheme for the categorical features present in the data extracted from malicious inputs. The KDDCUP99, UNSW-NB15 and CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 datasets have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encoding scheme. The results of the proposed encoding scheme are validated against seven other encoding schemes to ascertain the credibility and usability of the proposed scheme. The efficiency of the proposed system evaluated by applying different encoded versions of the datasets to train various machine learning models and determining the classification performance of the models on each dataset. The machine learning models trained with the proposed encoding scheme produced stable classification results and outperformed other encoding schemes when dimensionality reduction was applied on the data. The ensemble classifier trained using the proposed scheme was able to classify the data with an F1 score of 99.99% when the dimension-reduced entropy-encoded KDD Cup99 dataset was used to build the model. On the CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 dataset, the entropy encoding has exhibited a slightly improved classification parameters with the ensemble methods yielding a peak F1 score of 99.27%. We have also determined the feature importance values of the features present in the datasets to study the change in the contribution levels of the features when multiple categorical encoding schemes are applied upon the data.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,91187-91216,12,N/A,2024,,2,102,"Vipin Das, B.

Currently, no specific clinical decision rules are available for OAT patients. The aim of the study was to identify which clinical risk factors easily identifiable at first ED evaluation may be associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in OAT patients who suffered an MTBI. Methods Three thousand fifty-four patients in OAT with MTBI from four Italian centers were retrospectively considered. A decision tree analysis using the classification and regression tree (CART) method was conducted to evaluate both the pre- and post-traumatic clinical risk factors most associated with the presence of post-traumatic ICH after MTBI and their possible role in determining the patient’s risk. The decision tree analysis used all clinical risk factors identified at the first ED evaluation as input predictor variables. Results ICH following MTBI was present in 9.5% of patients (290/3054). The CART model created a decision tree using 5 risk factors, post-traumatic amnesia, post-traumatic transitory loss of consciousness, greater trauma dynamic, GCS less than 15, evidence of trauma above the clavicles, capable of stratifying patients into different increasing levels of ICH risk (from 2.5 to 61.4%). The absence of concussion and neurological alteration at admission appears to significantly reduce the possible presence of ICH. Conclusions The machine-learning-based CART model identified distinct prognostic groups of patients with distinct outcomes according to on clinical risk factors. Decision trees can be useful as guidance in patient selection and risk stratification of patients in OAT with MTBI.",BMC Emergency Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],f3c74b00-234d-45fc-89bd-c2099985b72b,BMC Emergency Medicine,Unknown,22,N/A,2022,2022-03-24,7,29,"G.

In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking ‘big’ by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking ‘deep’ by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that ‘business travel’, which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.",IEEE Access,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,60447-60458,9,N/A,2021,,51,56,"N.

This article, though, sheds some light on the actual differences that can be seen in how men and women drive. In this study, GPS-recorded driving dynamics data from 123 drivers, 48 women and 75 men, are analysed and drivers are categorised as aggressive, normal or gentle. A total of 10% of the drivers was categorised as aggressive, with an even distribution between the genders. For the gentle drivers, 11% of the drivers, the men dominated. The driving style investigation was extended to utilise machine learning, confirming the results from statistical tools. As driving style highly impacts a vehicle’s fuel consumption, while switching over to battery electric vehicles it is important to investigate how the different driving styles impact battery utilisation. Two Li-ion battery cell types were tested utilising the same load cycle with three levels of current amplitude, to represent accelerations for the three drive categories. While one cell type was insensitive to the current amplitude, the highly energy-optimised cell proved to be sensitive to higher current amplitudes, corresponding to a more aggressive driving style. Thus, the amplitude of the dynamic current can for some cells be a factor that needs to be considered for lifetime predictions, while it can be neglected for other cells.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2022,2022-09-16,5,41,"E.

This study explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and citizen engagement in improving road safety for vulnerable populations (pedestrians, cyclists) in Genoa, Italy. Aligned with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the project aims for a 50% reduction in traffic accidents by 2030.The AI4PublicPolicy initiative introduces the Virtual Policy Management Environment (VPME) platform. VPME utilizes ML, Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and chatbots to empower the policy development lifecycle. Citizen feedback is integrated through workshops and surveys, fostering a citizen-centric approach. The Genoa pilot program demonstrates VPME's capabilities. ML models analyse historical accident and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to predict future high-risk areas. These predictions inform resource allocation and targeted interventions for pedestrian crossings and school walking routes (""Pedibus""). Dashboards visualize the model outputs, allowing users to assess risk levels and predict accident occurrences. Future improvements include incorporating additional data sources (demographics, real-time traffic) for enhanced model accuracy. Citizen engagement played a vital role. Co-creation workshops facilitated stakeholder participation in defining Use Cases, User Stories, and project objectives. Discussions focused on integrating data from environmental, traffic, and citizen reporting systems with VPME solutions. Participants evaluated the project approach and provided valuable feedback. The project highlights the potential of AI and citizen collaboration for data-driven policymaking. This approach empowers municipalities to make informed decisions that prioritize public safety and well-being.

Diagnostic errors are an underappreciated cause of preventable mortality in hospitals and pose a risk for severe patient harm and increase hospital length of stay.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to explore the potential of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in improving diagnostic safety surveillance. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of the feasibility and potential to use electronic health records clinical notes and existing case review data.


METHODS
Safety Learning System case review data from 1 large health system composed of 10 hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from February 2016 to September 2021 were analyzed. The case review outcome included opportunities for improvement including diagnostic opportunities for improvement. To supplement case review data, electronic health record clinical notes were extracted and analyzed. A simple logistic regression model along with 3 forms of logistic regression models (ie, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Ridge, and Elastic Net) with regularization functions was trained on this data to compare classification performances in classifying patients who experienced diagnostic errors during hospitalization. Further, statistical tests were conducted to find significant differences between female and male patients who experienced diagnostic errors.


RESULTS
In total, 126 (7.4%) patients (of 1704) had been identified by case reviewers as having experienced at least 1 diagnostic error. Patients who had experienced diagnostic error were grouped by sex: 59 (7.1%) of the 830 women and 67 (7.7%) of the 874 men. Among the patients who experienced a diagnostic error, female patients were older (median 72, IQR 66-80 vs median 67, IQR 57-76; P=.02), had higher rates of being admitted through general or internal medicine (69.5% vs 47.8%; P=.01), lower rates of cardiovascular-related admitted diagnosis (11.9% vs 28.4%; P=.02), and lower rates of being admitted through neurology department (2.3% vs 13.4%; P=.04). The Ridge model achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.885), specificity (0.797), positive predictive value (PPV; 0.24), and F1-score (0.369) in classifying patients who were at higher risk of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing can be a potential solution to more effectively identifying and selecting potential diagnostic error cases for review and therefore reducing the case review burden.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2baad992-2268-4c38-9120-e453622f2eeb,Journal of medical Internet research,"

Remote monitoring frameworks for disease detection at an early stage are opposed by most conventional works. Even so, it ran into issues like increased operational complexity, higher resource costs, inaccurate predictions, longer data collection times, and a lower convergence rate. A remote health monitoring framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict heart disease and diabetes from medical datasets is the goal of this project. Patients' health data is collected via smart devices, and the resulting data is then combined using a variety of nodes, including a detection node, a visualisation node, and a prognostic node. People with long-term illnesses (such as the elderly and disabled) are in such greater demand than ever before that a new approach to healthcare delivery is essential. In the evolved paradigm, conventional physical medical services foundations like clinics, nursing homes, and long haul care offices will be old. Due to recent advancements in modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the smart healthcare system has become increasingly necessary (ML). This paper will discuss wearable and smartphone technologies, AI for medical diagnostics, and assistive structures, including social robots, that have been created for the surrounding upheld living climate.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT. Materials and Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I–II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors. Results Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794–0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873–0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789–0.915), respectively.

Although CaOx crystallization inhibitors have been suggested as a therapeutic modality already decades ago, limited progress has been made in the discovery of potent molecules with efficacy in animal disease models. Herein, an image‐based machine learning approach to systematically screen chemically modified myo‐inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) analogues is utilized, which enables the identification of a highly active divalent inositol phosphate molecule. To date, this is the first molecule shown to completely inhibit the crystallization process in the nanomolar range, reduce crystal–cell interactions, thereby preventing CaOx‐induced transcriptomic changes, and decrease renal CaOx deposition and kidney injury in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria. In conclusion, IP6 analogues based on such a scaffold may represent a new treatment option for CaOx nephropathies.",Advancement of science,journal,['JournalArticle'],28927fa0-8dca-4082-a7d0-abd989c8ef12,Advanced Science,Unknown,7,N/A,2020,2020-02-27,32,44,"Anna Kletzmayr, S.

Although there are differences between insomnia and SD, they have similar symptoms and the same animal model. Currently, there is a lack of microarray data on insomnia. Therefore, for now, we are going to apply the SD data to insomnia. Although many studies have explained the possible mechanisms associated with insomnia, no previous studies have considered the key genes associated with insomnia or the relationship between insomnia and immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between key genes and immune cells by identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of insomnia. Next, we verified the efficacy of these biomarkers experimentally. Methods First, we downloaded four microarrays (GSE11755, GSE12624, GSE28750, and GSE48080) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 239 normal human blood samples and 365 blood specimens from patients with SD. Then, we analyzed two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model to investigate these key genes. Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not. Discussion In summary, we identified a key gene (C2CD2L) that may facilitate the development of biomarkers for insomnia.",Frontiers in Neurology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3513ce18-3757-4358-b15f-7060af98e6d0,Frontiers in Neurology,Unknown,14,N/A,2023,2023-11-28,2,25,"Qianfei Wang, Dong Liu, Tianci Gao, Yulei Tao, Xin Li, Yuan Liu, Zhiliang Liu, Jianqiang Mei, Fen-qiao Chen","1754116731, 2269175808, 2261798802, 2261896580, 2269321127, 2253506296, 2109097712, 2052119092, 1753972539",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00471583b7d751fc7043be63f18eaa4b25985bec,"Biology, Medicine",1754116731

The starting point in this research is to identify subjects, which could be users of I4.0 or its elements, based on the similarity of indicators with indicators of a sample of 58 identified I4.0 companies. We developed a machine-learning model by using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) for this purpose, an approach that has not been used in any similar research. This research shows that the main difference between I4.0 and traditional industry is mostly observable in significantly better business performance of investment indicators, cost efficiency, technical equipment and market competitiveness.

Here, the authors propose a framework of integrated environment based on multi‐ agents to automate the full process of academic advising. The proposed framework consists of six agents namely, student agent, instructor agent, administrator agent, performance agent, schedule agent, and smart advisor agent. These agents are interacting together with the help of smart advisor agent, which manages the communication between them and provides smart advice based on machine learning techniques. In addition, the analysis of the proposed framework along with the deployment map is discussed by the authors.

Various sources of information can be used to this end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of sequences is modest. Author summary When two protein families interact, their sequences feature statistical dependencies. First, interacting proteins tend to share a common evolutionary history. Second, maintaining structure and interactions through the course of evolution yields coevolution, detectable via correlations in the amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",bioRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,PLOS Computational Biology,Unknown,19,N/A,2022,2022-08-24,6,49,"C.

Efficient microplastic monitoring is imperative to understanding the long-term effects and progression of microplastic effects in the environment. Numerical models are valuable in studying microplastic transport as they can be used to examine the effects of different parameters systematically to help elucidate the fate and transport processes of microplastics, thus providing a holistic view of microplastics in the ocean environment. By incorporating physical parameters (such as size, shape, density, and identity of microplastics), numerical models have gained better understanding of the physics of microplastic transport, predicted sinking velocities more accurately, and estimated microplastic pathways in marine environments. However, availability of large amounts of information about microplastic physical and chemical parameters is sparse. Machine learning and computer-vision tools can aid in acquiring environmental information and provide input to develop more accurate models and verify their predictions. More accurate models can further the understanding of microplastic transport, facilitate monitoring efforts, and thus optimize where more data collection can take place to ultimately improve machine learning tools. This review offers a perspective on how image-based machine learning can be exploited to help uncover the physics of microplastic transport behaviors. Additionally, the authors hope the review inspires studies that can bridge the gap between numerical modeling and machine learning for microplastic analysis to exploit their joined potential.",Journal of Applied Physics,journal,['Review'],ca503368-0618-4d11-aaeb-79d57f586f10,Journal of Applied Physics,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2023,2023-01-14,23,58,"S.

However, the inference and learning problems in the Boltzmann machine are NP-hard. The investigation of an effective learning algorithm for the Boltzmann machine is one of the most important challenges in the field of statistical machine learning. In this paper, we study Boltzmann machine learning based on the (first-order) spatial Monte Carlo integration method, referred to as the 1-SMCI learning method, which was proposed in the author’s previous paper. In the first part of this paper, we compare the method with the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation (MPLE) method using a theoretical and a numerical approaches, and show the 1-SMCI learning method is more effective than the MPLE.

As with any machine learning implementation, the challenge on the utilization of MLPNN in rainfall forecasting lies in the development and evaluation of MLPNN models which delivers optimal forecasting performance. This research conducted performance analysis of MLPNN models through data preparation, model designing, and model evaluation in order to determine which parameters are the best-fit configurations for MLPNN model implementation in rainfall forecasting. During rainfall data preparation, imputation process and spatial correlation evaluation of weather variables from various weather stations showed that the geographical location of the chosen weather stations did not have a direct correlation between stations with respect to rainfall behavior leading to the decision of utilizing the weather station having the most complete weather data to be fed in the MLPNN. By conducting performance analysis of MLPNN models with different combinations of training algorithms, activation functions, learning rate, and momentum, it was found out that MLPNN model having 100 hidden neurons with Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm and Sigmoid activation function delivered the lowest RMSE of 0.031537 while another MLPNN model having the same number of hidden neurons, the same activation function but Resilient Propagation as training algorithm had the lowest MAE of 0.0209.

With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding. Methods The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit ≥ 18 years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features ( n  = 88) were selected with clinicians’ input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in > 0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. Results There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632–0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs.

The method for developing recommendations based on collaborative filtering such as Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and hybrid methods of Machine Learning (ML) has been improved. The paper describes the design principles and functional requirements to a recommendation system in the form of a Web application for choosing the content required by user using movies as an example. The research has focused on solving issues related to cold start and scalability within the method of collaborative filtering. To effectively address these tasks, we have used hybrid training methods. A hybrid recommendation system (HRS) has been practically implemented for providing relevant content recommendations using movies as an example, taking into consideration the user's personal preferences based on the constructed hybrid method. We have improved an algorithm for developing content recommendations based on the collaborative filtering and Machine Learning for the combined filtration of similarity indicators among users or goods. The hybrid algorithm receives initial information in a different form, normalizes it, and generates relevant recommendations based on a combination of CF and CBF methods. Machine Learning is capable of defining those factors that influence the selection of relevant films, which improves development of recommendations specific to the user. To solve these tasks, a new improved method has been proposed, underlying which, in contrast to existing systems of recommendations, are the hybrid methods and Machine Learning. Machine Learning data for the designed HRS were borrowed from MovieLens. We have analyzed methods for developing recommendations to the user; existing recommendation systems have been reviewed.

Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2 mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. The F1 scores and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.86, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.86, and 0.81, 0.77, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. The explanation of the model output based on SHAP values can provide a reference basis for medical physicists when adjusting the plan, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of treatment plans.Conclusion: It is feasible to use a machine learning method based on radiomics to establish a gamma pass rate classification prediction model for IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvis. The XGBoost model performs better in classification than the other three tree-based ensemble models, and global explanations and single-sample explanations of the model output through SHAP values may offer reference for medical physicists to provide high-quality plans, promoting the clinical application and implementation of GPR prediction models, and providing safe and efficient personalized QA management for patients.",Frontiers of Physics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f0455aa5-b1f5-47b0-afdb-accda588a9c4,Frontiers in Physics,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2023,2023-08-10,1,34,"Q.

Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. Methods The multi-institutional PHIS+ clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children’s hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Results Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity . Conclusions NLP-based pneumonia information extraction of pediatric diagnostic imaging reports performed better than domain experts in this pilot study. NLP is an efficient method to extract information from a large collection of imaging reports to facilitate CER.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,journal,"['Study', 'JournalArticle']",2baad992-2268-4c38-9120-e453622f2eeb,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Unknown,19,N/A,2017,2017-05-01,17,40,"S.

However, they have strong relations since a longer processing time triggers a change in schedule. Although promising approaches already exist for mapping the influence of manufacturing processes on production scheduling, the variability of the production environment, including changing process conditions, technological parameters and the status of current orders, is usually ignored. For this reason, this paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that adaptively refines the production schedule by applying Machine Learning (ML)-models during the manufacturing process in order to predict the process-dependent parameters that influence the schedule. With the proper prediction of these parameters based on the process conditions, the production schedule is proactively adjusted to changing conditions not only to ensure the sufficient product quality but also to reduce the negative effects and losses that delayed rescheduling would cause. The proposed approach aims on minimizing the overall lateness by utilizing an active data exchange between the scheduling system and the predictive ML-models on the process level. The efficiency of the solution is demonstrated by a realistic case study using discrete event simulation.",MM Science Journal,journal,,c4287a50-1d43-4821-8ab3-26d575809b6d,MM Science Journal,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2019,2019-11-13,6,34,"M.

Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance.

A reflection on a data-driven concept of health,"Through hypothetical scenarios, this paper analyses whether machine learning (ML) could resolve one of the main shortcomings present in Christopher Boorse’s Biostatistical Theory of health (BST). In doing so, it foregrounds the boundaries and challenges of employing ML in formulating a naturalist (i.e., prima facie value-free) definition of health. The paper argues that a sweeping dataist approach cannot fully make the BST truly naturalistic, as prior theories and values persist. It also points out that supervised learning introduces circularity, rendering it incompatible with a naturalistic perspective. Additionally, it underscores the need for pre-existing auxiliary theories to assess results from unsupervised learning. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the epistemological entanglements between data and data processing methods to manage expectations about what data patterns can predict. In conclusion, the paper argues against delegating the final authority for defining complex concepts like health to AI systems, as it necessitates ethical judgment and capacities for deliberation that AI currently lacks. It also warns against granting creators and deployers of AI systems the discretionary authority to determine these definitions outside the wider social discussion, advocating for ongoing public engagement on normative notions. Failure to do so risks limiting individuals and collectives’ ability to shape a just digital future and diminishes their fundamental epistemic agency.",Ethics and Information Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],09bb329a-45bc-4561-860f-c8ac0e958895,Ethics and Information Technology,1-12,26,N/A,2023,2023-12-12,1,35,Ariel Guersenzvaig,2282850201,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004bbd2f00372355c5b4bf4085025c9c64de1ad2,"Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy",2282850201

We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), and high (0.5 < z < 1.0). By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for ∼60%–70% of the host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of ∼80%–95%, depending on the redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve a disk precision of 96%/82%/79% and bulge precision of 90%/90%/80% (for the three redshift bins) at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of 30%/43%/42%. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging surveys.",Astrophysical Journal,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",7652ece8-fbd3-4050-b927-cf29d7f0eaa8,The Astrophysical Journal,Unknown,944,N/A,2022,2022-12-20,3,76,"Chuan Tian, C.

This work presents a method to project the data from some discrete sensory locations to the overall reactor domain during conduction cooldown scenarios similar to High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). The existing models for conductive cooldown in a heterogeneous multi-body system, such as an assembly of prismatic blocks or pebble beds relies on knowledge of the thermal contact conductance, requiring significant knowledge of local thermal contacts and heat transport possibilities across those contacts. With a priori knowledge of bulk geometry features and some discrete sensors, a machine learning approach was devised. The presented work uses an experimental facility to mimic conduction cooldown with an assembly of 68 cylindrical rods initially heated to 1200 K. High-fidelity temperature data were collected using an infrared (IR) camera to provide training data to the model and validate the predicted temperature data. The machine learning approach used here first converts the macroscopic bulk geometry information into Graph-Laplacian, and then uses the eigenvectors of the Graph-Laplacian to develop Kernel functions. Support vector regression (SVR) was implemented on the obtained Kernels and used to predict the thermal response in a packed rod assembly during a conduction cooldown experiment. The usage of SVR modeling differs from most models today because of its representation of thermal coupling between rods in the core. When trained with thermographic data, the average normalized error is less than 2% over 400 s, during which temperatures of the assembly have dropped by more than 500 K.

Recently, several efficient link prediction algorithms have been developed, demonstrating robust results in both prediction accuracy and interpretability. However, existing research has not clearly established the relationship between network characteristics and link creation mechanisms. The ability to predict complex networks with diverse features still requires further investigation. In light of this, we introduce a novel framework designed to combine the best features of different link prediction algorithms when applied to the network, with the aim of achieving more reliable predictions about how networks will evolve in consequence. According to the proposed framework, this first focuses on the feature extraction stage. During this phase, we systematically identify and extract a comprehensive set of features from the network before moving on to the classification phase. Here, we utilize state-of-the-art ensemble learning models to assess and classify potential links within the network. By training our Machine Learning (ML) models on the extracted features, we can effectively predict whether a particular link is likely to form (positive link) or unlikely to form (negative link). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: Twitch and Facebook. Additionally, we assessed their performance on these datasets by conducting specific preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning steps. This research makes a significant contribution to improving link prediction in dynamic social networks.",Journal of Advances in Information Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],f4784c7b-6592-49eb-a116-7290e0398868,Journal of Advances in Information Technology,Unknown,Unknown,N/A,2025,,0,60,"Mohamed Badiy, Fatima Amounas, Mourade Azrour, Abdullah Alnajim, Abdulatif Alabdulatif, Sheroz Khan, Salma Bendaoud","2165409280, 2257021137, 34383536, 2292615146, 3412554, 2297446456, 120902465",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004cd6d5cc917a5149bf985daf80695c9ef52ffc,Computer Science,2165409280
