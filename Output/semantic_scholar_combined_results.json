        "abstract": "In the era of burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) popularity, understanding the patterns of EV users\u2019 behavior is imperative. This paper examines the trends in household charging sessions\u2019 timing, duration, and energy consumption by analyzing real-world residential charging data. By leveraging the information collected from each session, a novel framework is introduced for the efficient, real-time prediction of important charging characteristics. Utilizing historical data and user-specific features, machine learning models are trained to predict the connection duration, charging duration, charging demand, and time until the next session. These models enhance the understanding of EV users\u2019 behavior and provide practical tools for optimizing the EV charging infrastructure and effectively managing the charging demand. As the transportation sector becomes increasingly electrified, this work aims to empower stakeholders with insights and reliable models, enabling them to anticipate the localized demand and contribute to the sustainable integration of electric vehicles into the grid.",

        "title": "Personalized Prediction of Response to Smartphone-Delivered Meditation Training: Randomized Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "Background Meditation apps have surged in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals turning to these apps to cope with stress, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a \u201cPersonalized Advantage Index\u201d (PAI) reflecting an individual\u2019s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group \u00d7 PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

        "abstract": "Background Humans must be able to cope with the huge amounts of information produced by the information technology revolution. As a result, automatic text summarization is being employed in a range of industries to assist individuals in identifying the most important information. For text summarization, two approaches are mainly considered: text summarization by the extractive and abstractive methods. The extractive summarisation approach selects chunks of sentences like source documents, while the abstractive approach can generate a summary based on mined keywords. For low-resourced languages, e.g., Urdu, extractive summarization uses various models and algorithms. However, the study of abstractive summarization in Urdu is still a challenging task. Because there are so many literary works in Urdu, producing abstractive summaries demands extensive research. Methodology This article proposed a deep learning model for the Urdu language by using the Urdu 1 Million news dataset and compared its performance with the two widely used methods based on machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). The results show that the suggested deep learning model performs better than the other two approaches. The summaries produced by extractive summaries are processed using the encoder-decoder paradigm to create an abstractive summary. Results With the help of Urdu language specialists, the system-generated summaries were validated, showing the proposed model\u2019s improvement and accuracy.",

Therefore, in this paper, by analyzing the problems of current network intrusion detection (NID) and combining the application of transfer theory in the detection model, a NID model based on transfer component analysis (TCA) is proposed. Among them, the specific mathematical derivation of the algorithm and the detection process of transfer model are introduced in detail. Then, the classification performance of KNN and SVM based on TCA algorithm for network abnormal traffic is compared. The results show that the TCA algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy of NID, which is meaningful to expand the application scope of network abnormal traffic detection scheme based on machine learning.",

        "abstract": "In tropical and subtropical areas, malaria stands as a profound public health challenge, causing an estimated 247 million cases worldwide annually. Given the absence of a viable vaccine, the timely and effective treatment of malaria remains a critical priority. However, the growing resistance of parasites to currently utilized drugs underscores the critical need for the identification of new antimalarial therapies. Here, we aimed to identify potential new drug candidates against Plasmodium falciparum, the main causative agent of malaria, by analyzing the transcriptomes of different life stages of the parasite and identifying highly expressed genes. We searched for genes that were expressed in all stages of the parasite\u2019s life cycle, including the asexual blood stage, gametocyte stage, liver stage, and sexual stages in the insect vector, using transcriptomics data from publicly available databases. From this analysis, we found 674 overlapping genes, including 409 essential ones. By searching through drug target databases, we discovered 70 potential drug targets and 75 associated bioactive compounds. We sought to expand this analysis to similar compounds to known drugs. So, we found a list of 1557 similar compounds, which we predicted as actives and inactives using previously developed machine learning models against five life stages of Plasmodium spp. From this analysis, two compounds were selected, and the reactions were experimentally evaluated. The compounds HSP-990 and silvestrol aglycone showed potent inhibitory activity at nanomolar concentrations against the P. falciparum 3D7 strain asexual blood stage. Moreover, silvestrol aglycone exhibited low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, transmission-blocking potential, and inhibitory activity comparable to those of established antimalarials. These findings warrant further investigation of silvestrol aglycone as a potential dual-acting antimalarial and transmission-blocking candidate for malaria control.",

        "abstract": "In biomaterials development, creating materials with desirable properties can be a time\u2010consuming and resource\u2010intensive process, often relying on serendipitous discoveries. A potential route to accelerate this process is to employ artificial intelligence methodologies such as machine learning (ML). Herein, the possibility to predict anti\u2010inflammatory properties of the polymers by using a simplified model of inflammation and a restrained dataset is explored. Cellular assays with 50 different polymers are conducted using the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. These experiments generate a dataset which is used to develop a ML model based on Bayesian logistic regression. After conducting a Bayesian logistic regression analysis, two ML models, K\u2010nearest neighbors (KNN) and Na\u00efve Bayes, are employed to predict anti\u2010inflammatory polymers properties. The study finds that the probability of a polymer having anti\u2010inflammatory properties is multiplied by three if it is a polycation, and that nitric oxide secretion is a good indicator in determining the anti\u2010inflammatory properties of a polymer, which in this work are defined by tumor necrosis factor alpha expression decrease. Overall, the study suggests that with appropriate dataset design, ML techniques can provide valuable information on functional polymer properties, enabling faster and more efficient biomaterial development.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, many platforms provide open educational resources to learners. So, they must browse and explore several suggested contents to better assimilate their courses. To facilitate the selecting task of these resources, the present paper proposes an intelligent tutoring system that can access teaching contents available on the web automatically and offers them to learners as additional information sources. In doing so, the authors highlight the description logic approach and its knowledge representation strength that underwrites the modulization, inference, and querying about a web ontology language, and enhanced traditional tutoring systems architecture using ontologies and description logic to enable them to access various data sources on the web. Finally, this article concludes that the combination of machine learning with the semantic web has provided a supportive study environment and enhanced the schooling conditions within open and distance learning.",

        "title": "The aggrephagy-related gene TUBA1B influences clinical outcomes in glioma patients by regulating the cell cycle",
        "abstract": "Background Gliomas are common primary malignant brain tumors, with glioblastoma (GBM) being the most aggressive subtype. GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high TUBA1B expression is closely associated with glioma malignancy and poor prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) radiomic feature-based machine learning (ML) models in classifying the Gleason grade group (GG) of prostate cancer. Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 203 patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI before prostate biopsy were included. After manual segmentation, radiomic features (RFs) were extracted from T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, and high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI). Patients were split into training sets and testing sets according to a ratio of 8:2. A pipeline considering combinations of two feature selection (FS) methods and six ML classifiers was developed and evaluated. The performance of models was assessed using the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1-measure, and the area under curve (AUC). Results: On high b-value DWMRI-derived features, a combination of FS method recursive feature elimination (RFE) and classifier random forest achieved the highest performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs, with 97.0% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity, 98.0% precision, and 97.0% F1-measure. The method also achieved an average AUC for GG of 98%. Conclusion: Preoperative mpMRI radiomic analysis based on ML, as a noninvasive approach, showed good performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs. Advances in Knowledge: Herein, radiomic models based on preoperative mpMRI and ML were developed to classify prostate cancer into 5 GGs. Our study provides evidence that analysis of quantitative RFs extracted from high b-value DWMRI images based on a combination of FS method RFE and classifier random forest can be applied for multiclass grading of prostate cancer with an accuracy of 97.0%.",

A bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT)-based model was used to generate themes related to this perception. A qualitative thematic analysis and an independent review of the theme labels were conducted by the researchers. Results The findings indicate that public perceptions revolved around four themes: (1) health prevention and protection, (2) convenient living environments, (3) cognitive health and social integration, and (4) protecting the rights and interests of the older adult. Discussion Our study found that although the Plan aligns with most of these themes, it lacks clear planning for financial security and marital life.",

        "abstract": "Tailored disaster preparedness interventions may be more effective and equitable, yet little is known about specific factors associated with disaster household preparedness for older adults and/or those with African American/Black identities. This study aims to ascertain differences in the importance features of machine learning models of household disaster preparedness for four groups to inform culturally tailored intervention recommendations for nursing practice. A machine learning model was developed and tested by combining data from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Federal Emergency Management Agency National Household Survey. The primary outcome variable was a composite readiness score. A total of 252 variables from 15,048 participants were included. Over 10% of the sample self-identified as African American/Black and 30.3% reported being 65 years of age or older. Importance features varied regarding financial and insurance preparedness, information seeking and transportation between groups. These results reiterate the need for targeted interventions to support financial resilience and equitable resource access. Notably, older adults with Black racial identities were the only group where TV, TV news, and the Weather Channel was a priority feature for household disaster preparedness. Additionally, reliance on public transportation was most important among older adults with Black racial identities, highlighting priority needs for equity in disaster preparedness and policy.",

        "abstract": "Motivation Missense variants play a crucial role in cancer development, and distinguishing between those that frequently occur in cancer genomes and those that are rare may provide valuable insights into important functional mechanisms and consequences. Specifically, if common variants confer growth advantages, they may have undergone positive selection across different patients due to similar selection pressures. Moreover, studies have demonstrated the significance of rare mutations that arise as resistance mechanisms in response to drug treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of both recurrent and rare variants in cancer. In addition to this, most existing tools for variant prediction focus on distinguishing variants found in normal and disease populations, often without considering the specific disease contexts in which these variants arise. Instead, they typically build predictors that generalise across all diseases. Here, we introduce CanDrivR-CS, a set of cancer-specific gradient boosting models designed to distinguish between rare and recurrent cancer variants. Results We curated missense variant data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Cancer-type-specific models significantly outperformed a baseline pan-cancer model, achieving a maximum leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) F1 score of up to 90% for CanDrivRSKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma) and 89% for CanDrivR-SKCA (Skin Adenocarcinoma), compared to 79.2% for the baseline model. Notably, DNA shape properties consistently ranked among the top features for distinguishing recurrent and rare variants across all cancers. Specifically, recurrent missense variants frequently occurred in DNA bends and rolls, potentially implicating regions prone to DNA replication errors and acting as mutational hotspots. Availability and Implementation All training and test data, and Python code are available in our CanDrivR-CS GitHub repository: https://github.com/amyfrancis97/CanDrivR-CS.",

        "title": "An Improved Transfer Learning Model for Cyanobacterial Bloom Concentration Prediction",
        "abstract": "The outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms is a serious water environmental problem, and the harm it brings to aquatic ecosystems and water supply systems cannot be underestimated. It is very important to establish an accurate prediction model of cyanobacterial bloom concentration, which is a challenging issue. Machine learning techniques can improve the prediction accuracy, but a large amount of historical monitoring data is needed to train these models. For some waters with an inconvenient geographical location or frequent sensor failures, there are not enough historical data to train the model. To deal with this problem, a fused model based on a transfer learning method is proposed in this paper. In this study, the data of water environment with a large amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the source domain in order to learn the knowledge of cyanobacterial bloom growth characteristics and train the prediction model. The data of the water environment with a small amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the target domain in order to load the model trained in the source domain. Then, the training set of the target domain is used to participate in the inter-layer fine-tuning training of the model to obtain the transfer learning model. At last, the transfer learning model is fused with a convolutional neural network to obtain the prediction model. Various experiments are conducted for a 2 h prediction on the test set of the target domain. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of cyanobacterial blooms for the water environment with a low data volume.",

        "abstract": "Advances in early insect detection have been reported using digital technologies through camera systems, sensor networks, and remote sensing coupled with machine learning (ML) modeling. However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5\u201399.3% for NIR and between 94.2\u201399.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.",

        "title": "At the Confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Edge Computing in IoT-Based Applications: A Review and New Perspectives",
        "abstract": "Given its advantages in low latency, fast response, context-aware services, mobility, and privacy preservation, edge computing has emerged as the key support for intelligent applications and 5G/6G Internet of things (IoT) networks. This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents. These are the same factors that most studies have used to evaluate the success of an edge-based application. In this review, we first provide an in-depth analysis of the state of the art of AI in edge-based applications with a focus on eight application areas: smart agriculture, smart environment, smart grid, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart education, smart transportation, and security and privacy. Then, we present a qualitative comparison that emphasizes the main objective of the confluence, the roles and the use of artificial intelligence at the network edge, and the key enabling technologies for edge analytics. Then, open challenges, future research directions, and perspectives are identified and discussed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.",

        "abstract": "Background As primary care populations age, timely identification of palliative care need is becoming increasingly relevant. Previous studies have targeted particular patient populations with life-limiting disease, but few have focused on patients in a primary care setting. Toward this end, we propose a stepped-wedge pragmatic randomized trial whereby a machine learning algorithm identifies patients empaneled to primary care units at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, United States) with high likelihood of palliative care need. Methods 42 care team units in 9 clusters were randomized to 7 wedges, each lasting 42 days. For care teams in treatment wedges, palliative care specialists review identified patients, making recommendations to primary care providers when appropriate. Care teams in control wedges receive palliative care under the standard of care. Discussion This pragmatic trial therefore integrates machine learning into clinical decision making, instead of simply reporting theoretical predictive performance. Such integration has the possibility to decrease time to palliative care, improving patient quality of life and symptom burden.

        "abstract": "Spontaneous activity plays a crucial role in brain development by coordinating the integration of immature neurons into emerging cortical networks. High levels and complex patterns of spontaneous activity are generally associated with low rates of apoptosis in the cortex. However, whether spontaneous activity patterns directly encode for survival of individual cortical neurons during development remains an open question. Here, we longitudinally investigated spontaneous activity and apoptosis in developing cortical cultures, combining extracellular electrophysiology with calcium imaging. These experiments demonstrated that the early occurrence of calcium transients was strongly linked to neuronal survival. Silent neurons exhibited a higher probability of cell death, whereas high frequency spiking and burst behavior were almost exclusively detected in surviving neurons. In local neuronal clusters, activity of neighboring neurons exerted a pro-survival effect, whereas on the functional level, networks with a high modular topology were associated with lower cell death rates. Using machine learning algorithms, cell fate of individual neurons was predictable through the integration of spontaneous activity features. Our results indicate that high frequency spiking activity constrains apoptosis in single neurons through sustained calcium rises and thereby consolidates networks in which a high modular topology is reached during early development.",

        "title": "Challenges Faced During Implementation of Digital Twin in Construction Project Monitoring",
        "abstract": "Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining popularity because they provide precise digital copies of assets, processes, and systems. This is especially true when these DTs are paired with real-time simulation models that make use of modern technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. These combinations can provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of the monitored systems. Digital twin (DT) has shown tremendous potential to bring about revolutionary improvements in the field of construction site surveillance. There is, however, a notable paucity of empirical research identifying the constant elements affecting DT adoption in this industry. This research tries to fill that void by identifying the important elements that determine the usage of DT in construction. The study adopts a complete framework with the goal of increasing the use of DT in building site monitoring. The elements influencing the adoption and effectiveness of distributed ledger technology (DT) are divided into three categories: technological, organizational, and economic. Technological factors include the system's appropriateness and the robustness of the data infrastructure. Organizational considerations include the company's openness to innovation and leadership support. Economic aspects include things like return on investment (ROI) and cost-effectiveness. The research technique combines case studies and literature reviews to examine the benefits and drawbacks of DT in construction monitoring. This study's expected output is a comprehensive framework that aids construction businesses in optimizing the use of DT in site monitoring. This would allow for more efficient, data-driven, and forward-thinking processes. The study's ultimate purpose is to provide critical knowledge that will assist the building sector in adopting cutting-edge methods. The industry may better plan for the integration of this sophisticated technology into their operations by knowing the potential of DT and the variables driving its adoption. This, in turn, can lead to more efficiency, lower risks, and improved overall performance",

        "abstract": "Comprehensive growth index (CGI) more accurately reflects crop growth conditions than single indicators, which is crucial for precision irrigation, fertilization, and yield prediction. However, many current studies overlook the relationships between different growth parameters and their varying contributions to yield, leading to overlapping information and lower accuracy in monitoring crop growth. Therefore, this study focuses on winter wheat and constructs a comprehensive growth monitoring index (CGIac), based on adaptive weight allocation of growth parameters\u2019 contribution to yield, using data such as leaf area index (LAI), soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, plant height (PH), biomass (BM), and plant water content (PWC). Using UAV data on vegetation indices, feature selection was performed using the Elastic Net. The growth inversion model was then constructed using machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector regression (SVR). Based on the optimal growth inversion model for winter wheat, spatial distribution of wheat growth in the study area is obtained. The findings demonstrated that CGIac outperforms CGIav (constructed using equal weighting) and CGIcv (built using the coefficient of variation) in yield correlation and prediction accuracy. Specifically, the yield correlation of CGIac improved by up to 0.76 compared to individual indices, while yield prediction accuracy increased by up to 23.14%. Among the evaluated models, the RF model achieved the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.895 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0058. A comparison with wheat orthophotos from the same period confirmed that the inversion results were highly consistent with actual growth conditions in the study area. The proposed method significantly improved the accuracy and applicability of winter wheat growth monitoring, overcoming the limitations of single parameters in growth prediction. Additionally, it provided new technological support and innovative solutions for regional crop monitoring and precision farming operations.",

        "abstract": "Reaction databases provide a great deal of useful information to assist planning of experiments, but do not provide any interpretation or chemical concepts to accompany this information. In this work reactions are labeled with experimental conditions and network analysis shows that consistencies within clusters of data points can be leveraged to organize this information. In particular, this analysis shows how particular experimental conditions (specifically solvent) are effective in enabling specific organic reactions (Friedel-Crafts, Aldol addition, Claisen condensation, Diels-Alder, and Wittig), including variations within each reaction class. An example of network analysis is shown in the graphical abstract, where data points for a Claisen condensation reaction break into clusters that depend on the catalyst and chemical structure. This type of clustering, which mimics how a chemist reasons, is derived directly from the network. Therefore the findings of this work could augment synthesis planning by providing predictions in a fashion that mimics human chemists. To numerically evaluate solvent prediction ability, three methods are compared: network analysis (through the k-nearest neighbor algorithm), a support vector machine, and a deep neural network. The most accurate method in 4 of the 5 test cases is the network analysis, with deep neural networks also showing good prediction scores. The network analysis tool was evaluated by an expert panel of chemists, who generally agreed that the algorithm produced accurate solvent choices while simultaneously being transparent in the underlying reasons for its predictions.",

Its simple but universal principles have found applications in the most diverse disciplines, including economics, social sciences, evolutionary biology, as well as logic, system science and computer science. Despite its long-standing tradition and its many advances, game theory is still a young and developing science. In this paper, we describe some recent and exciting applications in the \ufb01elds of machine learning and privacy.",

        "title": "The Machine Prediction of the Mutual Trade between the PRC and the Czech Republic in the Global Extraordinary Situation",
        "abstract": "Research background: International trade is a substantial constituent of the global and regional economic development. The analysis of mutual trade serves as a tool for a monetary expression of economic transactions between a particular country and its foreign partners for a specific period. For the Czech Republic (CR), the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is the biggest exporter and the second biggest importer. The USA, however, imposes a number of economic sanctions against the PRC that do not have any significant impact on the trade between both countries and the overall growth of the Chinese economy, yet they affect the behavior of consumers and producers both in the USA and in the PRC.\nPurpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to use machine learning for predicting the future values of the mutual trade between the CR and the PRC for one calendar year (i.e. 12 months).\nMethods: Monthly data of these two states\u00b4 import and export are used to predict bilateral trade flow. The time series begins in January 2005 and ends in April 2020. Thus, the time series contains 184 data lines. Artificial intelligence - artificial neural networks - is used to predict bilateral trade flow between the PRC and the CR. The development of trade is then compared with the mutual sanctions of the PRC and the USA.\nFindings & Value added: This is expected that the mutual trade balance to be negative from the perspective of the CR. COVID-19 or the sanctions imposed in the international trade will not significantly affect the development of the mutual trade between the CR and the PRC.",

        "abstract": "The spatiotemporal proteome of the intervertebral disc (IVD) underpins its integrity and function. We present DIPPER, a deep and comprehensive IVD proteomic resource comprising 94 genome-wide profiles from 17 individuals. To begin with, protein modules defining key directional trends spanning the lateral and anteroposterior axes were derived from high-resolution spatial proteomes of intact young cadaveric lumbar IVDs. They revealed novel region-specific profiles of regulatory activities and displayed potential paths of deconstruction in the leveland location-matched aged cadaveric discs. Machine learning methods predicted a \u2018hydration matrisome\u2019 that connects extracellular matrix with MRI intensity. Importantly, the static proteome used as point-references can be integrated with dynamic proteome (SILAC/degradome) and transcriptome data from multiple clinical samples, enhancing robustness and clinical relevance. The data, findings, and methodology, available on a web interface (http://www.sbms.hku.hk/dclab/ DIPPER/), will be valuable references in the field of IVD biology and proteomic analytics. Introduction The 23 intervertebral discs (IVDs) in the human spine provide stability, mobility, and flexibility. IVD degeneration (IDD), most common in the lumbar region (Saleem et al., 2013; Teraguchi et al., 2014), is associated with a decline in function and a major cause of back pain, affecting up to 80% of the world\u2019s population at some point in life (Rubin, 2007), presenting significant socioeconomic burdens. Multiple interacting factors such as genetics, influenced by ageing, mechanical and other stress factors, contribute to the pathobiology, onset, severity, and progression of IDD (Munir et al., 2018). IVDs are large, avascular, extracellular matrix (ECM)-rich structures comprising three compartments: a hydrated nucleus pulposus (NP) at the centre, surrounded by a tough annulus fibrosus (AF) at the periphery, and cartilaginous endplates of the adjoining vertebral bodies (Humzah and Soames, 1988). The early adolescent NP is populated with vacuolated notochordal-like cells, which are gradually replaced by small chondrocyte-like cells (Risbud et al., 2015).

        "abstract": "Natural products play a significant role in cancer chemotherapy. They are likely to provide many lead structures, which can be used as templates for the construction of novel drugs with enhanced antitumor activity. Traditional research approaches studied structure-activity relationship of natural products and obtained key structural properties, such as chemical bond or group, with the purpose of ascertaining their effect on a single cell line or a single tissue type. Here, for the first time, we develop a machine learning method to comprehensively predict natural products responses against a panel of cancer cell lines based on both the gene expression and the chemical properties of natural products. The results on two datasets, training set and independent test set, show that this proposed method yields significantly better prediction accuracy. In addition, we also demonstrate the predictive power of our proposed method by modeling the cancer cell sensitivity to two natural products, Curcumin and Resveratrol, which indicate that our method can effectively predict the response of cancer cell lines to these two natural products. Taken together, the method will facilitate the identification of natural products as cancer therapies and the development of precision medicine by linking the features of patient genomes to natural product sensitivity.",

        "title": "Deep Learning based Effective Steganalysis",
        "abstract": "There is an evident paradigm shift in steganalysis techniques with discovery of deep learning networks. As steganalysis is a classification task, it is done by machine learning classifiers and ensembles of them. But with the proliferation of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks in many areas, the performance of steganalysis techniques have jumped up to a another high, because of the application of Convolutional Neural Networks. The traditional steganalysis techniques consists two important steps, i.e., feature extraction and classification; where as deep learning networks learn the features automatically, eliminating the need of extraction of handcrafted features. Because of this feature CNNs were highly successful in image recognition and image classification techniques. In addition to that, feature extraction and classification are combined together in deep learning hence classification would be more effective because of the learning of the features which are really important for classification. But in Steganalysis the task is to detect very subtle and weak noise created by the hidden data with steganography techniques. We have designed a deep CNN architecture customized for steganalysis task based on existing residual neural networks frame. We have introduced a descriptor to capture the inter pixel dependencies and which acts as an indicator for weightage of a particular feature maps. Thus the classifier can give more weightage to effective feature maps instead of treating all the feature maps equally. We have also used a gating mechanism by using sigmoid function after nonlinear activation function sandwiched between two fully connected layers. This enhancement to the existing deep residual neural networks has given better results in terms of error detection rate compared to the other deep learning based steganalysis techniques.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a shape\u2010based inflow scenarios reduction framework applied in long\u2010term hydro\u2010thermal scheduling. This scheduling problem involves strategically managing the limited stored hydro energy in coordination with the electricity system. The scenario fan problem, selected as a long\u2010term hydro\u2010thermal scheduling approach, can effectively represent the individual hydropower plants and their short\u2010term flexibility within the long\u2010term scheduling process, making it well\u2010suited for capturing the disaggregated physical characteristics of hydro stations. However, the computational burden of scenario fan problem increases due to the complexity of the cascaded system and the large number of inflow scenarios. To tackle these challenges, a machine learning clustering method is developed for extracting shape\u2010based features to capture the energy and shape attributes of hydro inflows. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing it with four established clustering methods. This evaluation was carried out on a hydro\u2010thermal test case, utilizing both in\u2010sample and out\u2010of\u2010sample data analysis. The findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other methods in terms of computational time by 42.6% and optimal reservoir trajectories by 12.1% considering K\u2010means using Euclidean distance as the benchmark. Additionally, this study showcases the feasibility of performing long\u2010term hydro\u2010thermal scheduling at a granular level, with detailed topological information and a shorter time scale. This expanded approach opens up new possibilities for addressing the integration of renewable energy resources within the realm of long\u2010term hydro\u2010thermal scheduling.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important topics in the field of wireless sensor networks is the development of approaches to improve network lifetime. In this paper, an energy-efficient control and routing protocol for wireless sensor networks is presented. This algorithm is based on reinforcement learning for energy management in the network. This protocol seeks to optimize routing policies to maximize the long-term reward received by each node, using reinforcement learning, which is a machine learning approach. In order to improve the lifetime of wireless sensor network, three energy management approaches have been proposed. The first approach is to navigate correctly using reinforcement learning to reduce the length of the routes and to improve energy consumption. The second approach is to exploit a sleep scheduling technique to improve node energy consumption. The last approach is used to restrict data transmission of each node based on the received data change rate. Simulation results show that in terms of network lifespan, the proposed method significantly outperforms previous reported methods.",

        "title": "Unraveling the role of ADAMs in clinical heterogeneity and the immune microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma: insights from single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA sequencing",
        "abstract": "Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and heterogeneous tumor with limited treatment options and unfavorable prognosis. The crucial role of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) gene family in the tumor microenvironment of HCC remains unclear. Methods This study employed a novel multi-omics integration strategy to investigate the potential roles of ADAM family signals in HCC. A series of single-cell and spatial omics algorithms were utilized to uncover the molecular characteristics of ADAM family genes within HCC. The GSVA package was utilized to compute the scores for ADAM family signals, subsequently stratified into three categories: high, medium, and low ADAM signal levels through unsupervised clustering. Furthermore, we developed and rigorously validated an innovative and robust clinical prognosis assessment model by employing 99 mainstream machine learning algorithms in conjunction with co-expression feature spectra of ADAM family genes. To validate our findings, we conducted PCR and IHC experiments to confirm differential expression patterns within the ADAM family genes. Results Gene signals from the ADAM family were notably abundant in endothelial cells, liver cells, and monocyte macrophages. Single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analyses have both revealed the molecular heterogeneity of the ADAM gene family, further emphasizing its significant impact on the development and progression of HCC. In HCC tissues, the expression levels of ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 were markedly elevated. Elevated ADAM family signal scores were linked to adverse clinical outcomes and disruptions in the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming. An ADAM prognosis signal, developed through the utilization of 99 machine learning algorithms, could accurately forecast the survival duration of HCC, achieving an AUC value of approximately 0.9. Conclusions This study represented the inaugural report on the deleterious impact and prognostic significance of ADAM family signals within the tumor microenvironment of HCC.",

        "abstract": "Considering the challenge of population ageing and the substantial health problem among the elderly population from falls, the purpose of this study was to verify whether it is possible to distinguish accurately between older fallers and non-fallers, based on data from wearable inertial sensors collected during a specially designed test battery. A comprehensive but practical test battery using 5 wearable inertial sensors for multifactorial fall risk assessment was designed. This was followed by an experimental study on 196 community-dwelling Korean older women, categorized as fallers (N1\u2009=\u200982) and non-fallers (N2\u2009=\u2009114) based on prior history of falls. Six machine learning models (logistic regression, na\u00efve bayes, decision tree, random forest, boosted tree and support vector machine) were proposed for faller classification. Results indicated that compared with non-fallers, fallers performed significantly worse on the test battery. In addition, the application of sensor data and support vector machine for faller classification achieved an overall accuracy of 89.4% with 92.7% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity. These findings suggest that wearable inertial sensor based systems show promise for elderly fall risk assessment, which could be implemented in clinical practice to identify \u201cat-risk\u201d individuals reliably to promote proactive fall prevention.",

        "title": "Hip and Wrist-Worn Accelerometer Data Analysis for Toddler Activities",
        "abstract": "Although accelerometry data are widely utilized to estimate physical activity and sedentary behavior among children age 3 years or older, for toddlers age 1 and 2 year(s), accelerometry data recorded during such behaviors have been far less examined. In particular, toddler\u2019s unique behaviors, such as riding in a stroller or being carried by an adult, have not yet been examined. The objective of this study was to describe accelerometry signal outputs recorded during participation in nine types of behaviors (i.e., running, walking, climbing up/down, crawling, riding a ride-on toy, standing, sitting, riding in a stroller/wagon, and being carried by an adult) among toddlers. Twenty-four toddlers aged 13 to 35 months (50% girls) performed various prescribed behaviors during free play in a commercial indoor playroom while wearing ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on a hip and a wrist. Participants\u2019 performances were video-recorded. Based on the video data, accelerometer data were annotated with behavior labels to examine accelerometry signal outputs while performing the nine types of behaviors. Accelerometer data collected during 664 behavior assessments from the 21 participants were used for analysis. Hip vertical axis counts for walking were low (median = 49 counts/5 s). They were significantly lower than those recorded while a toddler was \u201ccarried\u201d by an adult (median = 144 counts/5 s; p < 0.01). While standing, sitting, and riding in a stroller, very low hip vertical axis counts were registered (median \u2264 5 counts/5 s). Although wrist vertical axis and vector magnitude counts for \u201ccarried\u201d were not higher than those for walking, they were higher than the cut-points for sedentary behaviors. Using various accelerometry signal features, machine learning techniques showed 89% accuracy to differentiate the \u201ccarried\u201d behavior from ambulatory movements such as running, walking, crawling, and climbing. In conclusion, hip vertical axis counts alone may be unable to capture walking as physical activity and \u201ccarried\u201d as sedentary behavior among toddlers. Machine learning techniques that utilize additional accelerometry signal features could help to recognize behavior types, especially to differentiate being \u201ccarried\u201d from ambulatory movements.",

        "abstract": "One of the most significant graph data analysis tasks is graph classification, as graphs are complex data structures used for illustrating relationships between entity pairs. Graphs are essential in many domains, such as the description of chemical molecules, biological networks, social relationships, etc. Real-world graphs are complicated and large. As a result, there is a need to find a way to represent or encode a graph\u2019s structure so that it can be easily utilized by machine learning models. Therefore, graph embedding is considered one of the most powerful solutions for graph representation. Inspired by the Doc2Vec model in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this paper first investigates different ways of (sub)graph embedding to represent each graph or subgraph as a fixed-length feature vector, which is then used as input to any classifier. Thus, two supervised classifiers\u2014a deep neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)\u2014are proposed to enhance graph classification. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed models obtain competitive results and are superior to some traditional classification methods and deep-learning-based approaches on three out of five benchmark datasets, with an impressive accuracy rate of 94% on the NCI1 dataset.",

        "abstract": "In the current technological era, artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly popular.\u00a0 Machine learning, as the branch of AI is taking charge in every field such as healthcare, the Stock market, Automation, Robotics, Image Processing, and so on. In the current scenario, machine learning and/or deep learning are becoming very popular in medical science for disease prediction. Much research is underway in the form of disease prediction models by machine learning. To ensure the performance and accuracy of the machine learning model, it is important to keep some basic things in mind during training. The machine learning model has several issues which must be rectified duration of the training of the model so that the learning model works efficiently such as model selection, parameter tuning, dataset splitting, cross-validation, bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, underfitting, and so on. Under- and over-fitting are the two main issues that affect machine learning models. This research paper mainly focuses on minimizing and/or preventing the problem of overfitting and underfitting machine learning models.",

Herein, a flexible biomimetic ANS with multimode fuzzy perception and brain\u2010like cognition is developed, by fusing the ion migration\u2010modulated MXene synapse and machine learning (ML). First of all, the elementary perceptual ability to mimic biological neuroreceptors is demonstrated. Motion artifact in the ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) current is eliminated. Furthermore, the multimode perception and brain\u2010like cognition are accomplished by synaptic currents (SCs) and nine ML algorithms. Finally, the cognitions of materials, gestures, and motions are conducted by distributing the ANS devices across body joints, and with the optimal ML method, the accuracies can reach 80%, 100%, and 90%, respectively. This synapse\u2010based ANS may provide a new idea for developing next\u2010generation neuromorphic intelligent robots.",

        "title": "EVlncRNA-Dpred: improved prediction of experimentally validated lncRNAs by deep learning",
        "abstract": "Abstract Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) played essential roles in nearly every biological process and disease. Many algorithms were developed to distinguish lncRNAs from mRNAs in transcriptomic data and facilitated discoveries of more than 600 000 of lncRNAs. However, only a tiny fraction (<1%) of lncRNA transcripts (~4000) were further validated by low-throughput experiments (EVlncRNAs). Given the cost and labor-intensive nature of experimental validations, it is necessary to develop computational tools to prioritize those potentially functional lncRNAs because many lncRNAs from high-throughput sequencing (HTlncRNAs) could be resulted from transcriptional noises. Here, we employed deep learning algorithms to separate EVlncRNAs from HTlncRNAs and mRNAs. For overcoming the challenge of small datasets, we employed a three-layer deep-learning neural network (DNN) with a K-mer feature as the input and a small convolutional neural network (CNN) with one-hot encoding as the input. Three separate models were trained for human (h), mouse (m) and plant (p), respectively. The final concatenated models (EVlncRNA-Dpred (h), EVlncRNA-Dpred (m) and EVlncRNA-Dpred (p)) provided substantial improvement over a previous model based on support-vector-machines (EVlncRNA-pred). For example, EVlncRNA-Dpred (h) achieved 0.896 for the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve, compared with 0.582 given by sequence-based EVlncRNA-pred model. The models developed here should be useful for screening lncRNA transcripts for experimental validations. EVlncRNA-Dpred is available as a web server at https://www.sdklab-biophysics-dzu.net/EVlncRNA-Dpred/index.html, and the data and source code can be freely available along with the web server.",

        "abstract": "This work documents the properties of a number of isomers of molecular formula C2H5NO from the most stable, acetamide, through 1,2-oxazetidine and including even higher energy species largely of a dipolar nature. Only two of the isomers have been detected in emissions from the interstellar medium (ISM); possible further candidates are identified, and the likelihood of their being detectable is considered. In general, hardly any of these compounds have been discussed in the existing chemical literature, so this work represents an important contribution extending the canon of chemical bonding which can contribute to machine learning, providing a more exacting test of AI applications. The presence in the ISM of acetamide, CH3C(O)NH2, is the subject of current debate with no clear and obvious paths to its formation; it is shown that a 1,3-[H]-transfer from (E,Z)-ethanimidic acid, CH3C(OH)=NH, is feasible in spite of an energy barrier of 130 kJ mol\u20131. It is speculated that imidic acid can itself be formed from abundant precursors, H2O and CH3C\u2261N, in an acid-induced, water addition, autocatalytic reaction on water\u2013ice grains. H3CC\u2261NH3CC\u2261NH+ + H2OH3CC(O+H2)=NHH3CC(OH)=NH + H3O+",

        "abstract": "Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, forms in cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin. There are low-income regions that lack specialized dermatologists, causing skin cancer to be diagnosed in advanced stages. In Peru, in high Andean communities with low resources, the problem is aggravated by the high incidence of ultraviolet radiation and lack of medical resources to make the diagnosis. Normally, mole images are obtained from dermatoscopes. The present work seeks to use mole images obtained from smartphones to make the classification of them as suspected or not suspected of being melanoma, by means of a feature extraction algorithm. The first step is to make color and lighting corrections. After this, the image is segmented using the K-Means algorithm, and we obtain the areas of the mole and skin. With the segmented mole we proceed to extract the main visual characteristics and then use classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest and naive bayes, which obtained an accuracy of 0.9473, 0.7368 and 0.6842, respectively. These results show that it is possible to use images obtained from smartphones to develop a classification algorithm with 94.73% accuracy to detect melanoma in skin moles.",

        "abstract": "RNA sequencing has become the standard technique for high resolution genome-wide monitoring of gene expression. As such, it often comprises the first step towards understanding complex molecular mechanisms driving various phenotypes, spanning organ development to disease genesis, monitoring and progression. An advantage of RNA sequencing is its ability to capture complex transcriptomic events such as alternative splicing which results in alternate isoform abundance. At the same time, this advantage remains algorithmically and computationally challenging, especially with the emergence of even higher resolution technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing. Although several algorithms have been proposed for the effective detection of differential isoform expression from RNA-Seq data, no widely accepted golden standards have been established. This fact is further compounded by the significant differences in the output of different algorithms when applied on the same data. In addition, many of the proposed algorithms remain scarce and poorly maintained. Driven by these challenges, we developed a novel integrative approach that effectively combines the most widely used algorithms for differential transcript and isoform analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We demonstrate its usability by applying it on simulated data based on several organisms, and using several performance metrics; we conclude that our strategy outperforms the application of the individual algorithms. Finally, our approach is implemented as an R Shiny application, with the underlying data analysis pipelines also available as docker containers.",

        "abstract": "Scene text detection, this task of detecting text from real images, is a hot research topic in the machine vision community. Most of the current research is based on an anchor box. These methods are complex in model design and time-consuming to train. In this paper, we propose a new Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection (FCOS)-based text detection method that can robustly detect multioriented and multilingual text from natural scene images in a per pixel prediction approach. Our proposed text detector employs an anchor-free approach, unlike state-of-the-art text detectors that do not rely on a predefined anchor box. In order to enhance the feature representation ability of FCOS for text detection tasks, we apply the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) as the backbone network, enhancing the model learning capacity and increasing the receptive field. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on multioriented (ICDAR-2015, ICDAR-2017 MLT) and horizontal (ICDAR-2013) text detection benchmark tasks. Moreover, our method has an f-measure of 88.65 and 86.32 for the benchmark datasets ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015, respectively, and 80.75 for the ICDAR-2017 MLT dataset.",

        "abstract": "\u2013 This research explores the integration of Software-Defined Networking into 5G-enabled Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (5G-VANETs) with a focus on the implementation of a package filtering model. The goal is to enhance networking within these dynamic environments. By leveraging SDN's centralized control capabilities, this study aims to optimize network performance, enhance security, and improve the quality of service in 5G-VANETs. The outcomes of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems and vehicular communication networks. As the VANET milieu operates dynamically, the major issues are to afford high reliability, low latency, and high bandwidth. 5G significantly provides seamless connectivity and ultrafast speed for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Advancements in internet of vehicle brought few security issues such as illegal device access, data injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To avoid these issues, this work implements the Package Filtering Model (PFM) that is trained using machine learning and ready to use for real-time detection. It filters out the fraudulent transaction based on the frequency and behavioural characteristics of the communication. The simulation results ensure that the proposed mechanism affords enhanced packet delivery, lower transmission delay, minimum fraud package, and bare minimum block processing time compared to the existing state-of-the-art mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN\nA systemic review and a meta-analysis. We also provided a retrospective cohort for validation in this study.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\n(1) Using a meta-analysis to determine the pooled discriminatory ability of The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classical algorithm (CA) and machine learning algorithms (MLA); and (2) test the hypothesis that SORG-CA has less variability in performance than SORG-MLA in non-American validation cohorts as SORG-CA does not incorporates regional-specific variables such as body mass index as input.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter data extraction from the included studies, logit-transformation was applied for extracted AUCs for further analysis. The discriminatory abilities of both algorithms were directly compared by their logit (AUC)s. Further subgroup analysis by region (America vs non-America) was also conducted by comparing the corresponding logit (AUC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe pooled logit (AUC)s of 90-day SORG-CA was .82 (95% confidence interval [CI], .53-.11), 1-year SORG-CA was 1.11 (95% CI, .74-1.48), 90-day SORG-MLA was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.63), and 1-year SORG-MLA was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.17-1.98). All the algorithms performed better in United States than in Taiwan (P < .001). The performance of SORG-CA was less influenced by a non-American cohort than SORG-MLA.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese observations might highlight the importance of incorporating region-specific variables into existing models to make them generalizable to racially or geographically distinct regions.",

        "abstract": "This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of gender inequality in Sri Lanka, focusing on the relationship between key socioeconomic factors and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) from 1990 to 2022. By applying machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees and Ensemble methods, the study investigates the influence of economic indicators such as GDP per capita, government expenditure, government revenue, and unemployment rates on gender disparities. The analysis reveals that higher GDP and government revenues are associated with reduced gender inequality, while greater unemployment rates exacerbate disparities. Explainable AI techniques (SHAP) further highlight the critical role of government policies and economic development in shaping gender equality. These findings offer specific insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions aimed at reducing gender gaps in Sri Lanka, particularly by prioritizing economic growth and inclusive public spending.",

        "abstract": "Tahu berformalin adalah salah satu jenis makanan yang sering mengandung bahan-bahan kimia yang dapat mengawetkan daripada tahu tanpa formalin. Pada tahu berformalin dapat memberikan tekstur lebih kenyal dan berwarna putih bersih. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengklasifikasikan tahu berformalin dan tahu tidak berformalin. Pada paper ini menggunakan algoritma Stochastic Gradient Descent atau dalam penerapannya lebih dikenal dengan SGD Classifier yang merupakan bagian dari algoritma machine learning untuk klasifikasi, regresi maupun jaringan syaraf tiruan serta algoritma ini sangat efisien pada dataset berskala besar. Penelitian ini mencoba menerapkan algoritma SGD pada dataset tahu berformalin dengan jumlah dataset yakni 11000 yang dimana 5500 data tahu berformalin dan 5500 data tahu tidak berformalin. Setelah dilakukan beberapa tahapan dalam pengujian dengan algoritma SGD maka diperolah hasil akurasi, presisi, recall, f1-score pada model yang masing-masing 82.6% untuk akurasi, 81.7% untuk presisi, 84.1% untuk recall, 83.5% untuk f1-score dan dilakukan pengujian menggunakan 10 data yang tidak termasuk dalam data latih memperoleh performansi rata-rata akurasi sebesar 70%, presisi 71%, recall 70% dan f1-score 70%.",

        "abstract": "Background Society is burdened with stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) complicates clinical manifestations of stroke. In this study, we redefined the CSVD burden score and incorporated it into a novel radiological-clinical prediction model for SAP. Materials and methods A total of 1278 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 were included. The participants were divided into training and testing groups using fivefold cross-validation method. Four models, two traditional statistical models (logistic regression and ISAN) and two machine learning models (random forest and support vector machine), were established and evaluated. The outcomes and baseline characteristics were compared between the SAP and non-SAP groups. Results Among the of 1278 patients, 281(22.0%) developed SAP after their first ICH. Multivariate analysis revealed that the logistic regression (LR) model was superior in predicting SAP in both the training and testing groups. Independent predictors of SAP after ICH included total CSVD burden score (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03\u20131.54), haematoma extension into ventricle (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.87\u20133.31), haematoma with multilobar involvement (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.44\u20133.18), transpharyngeal intubation operation (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.7\u20135.62), admission NIHSS score\u2009\u2265\u200910 (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.42\u20133.01), male sex (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16\u20132.52), and age\u2009\u2265\u200967 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.56\u20133.22). The patients in the SAP group had worse outcomes than those in the non-SAP group. Conclusion This study established a clinically combined imaging model for predicting stroke-associated pneumonia and demonstrated superior performance compared with the existing ISAN model. Given the poor outcomes observed in patients with SAP, the use of individualised predictive nomograms is vital in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Most EEG-based BCI systems make use of well-studied patterns of brain activity. However, those systems involve tasks that indirectly map to simple binary commands such as \"yes\" or \"no\" or require many weeks of biofeedback training. We hypothesized that signal processing and machine learning methods can be used to discriminate EEG in a direct \"yes\"/\"no\" BCI from a single session. Blind source separation (BSS) and spectral transformations of the EEG produced a 180-dimensional feature space. We used a modified genetic algorithm (GA) wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to search the space of feature subsets. The GA-based search found feature subsets that outperform full feature sets and random feature subsets. Also, BSS transformations of the EEG outperformed the original time series, particularly in conjunction with a subset search of both spaces. The results suggest that BSS and feature selection can be used to improve the performance of even a \"direct,\" single-session BCI.",

        "abstract": "This paper utilizes multi-objective optimization for efficient fabrication of a novel Carbon Nanotube (CNT) based nanocomposite proximity sensor. A previously developed model is utilized to generate a large data set required for optimization which included dimensions of the film sensor, applied excitation frequency, medium permittivity, and resistivity of sensor dielectric, to maximize sensor sensitivity and minimize the cost of the material used. To decrease the runtime of the original model, an artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented by generating a one-thousand samples data set to create and train a black-box model. This model is used as the fitness function of a genetic algorithm (GA) model for dual-objective optimization. We also represented the 2D Pareto Frontier of optimum solutions and scatters of distribution. A parametric study is also performed to discern the effects of the various device parameters. The results provide a wide range of geometrical data leading to the maximum sensitivity at the minimum cost of conductive nanoparticles. The innovative contribution of this research is the combination of GA and ANN, which results in a fast and accurate optimization scheme.",

        "abstract": "Smart speaker voice assistants (VAs) such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have been widely adopted due to their seamless integration with smart home devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. These VA services raise privacy concerns, especially due to their access to our speech. This work considers one such use case: the unaccountable and unauthorized surveillance of a user's emotion via speech emotion recognition (SER). This paper presents DARE-GP, a solution that creates additive noise to mask users' emotional information while preserving the transcription-relevant portions of their speech. DARE-GP does this by using a constrained genetic programming approach to learn the spectral frequency traits that depict target users' emotional content, and then generating a universal adversarial audio perturbation that provides this privacy protection. Unlike existing works, DARE-GP provides: a) real-time protection of previously unheard utterances, b) against previously unseen black-box SER classifiers, c) while protecting speech transcription, and d) does so in a realistic, acoustic environment. Further, this evasion is robust against defenses employed by a knowledgeable adversary. The evaluations in this work culminate with acoustic evaluations against two off-the-shelf commercial smart speakers using a small-form-factor (raspberry pi) integrated with a wake-word system to evaluate the efficacy of its real-world, real-time deployment.",

        "abstract": "Recent technological and methodological changes in farming have led to an emerging set of claims about the role of digital technology in food production. Known as precision agriculture, the integration of digital management and surveillance technologies in farming is normatively presented as a revolutionary transformation. Proponents contend that machine learning, Big Data, and automation will create more accurate, efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly food production, staving off both food insecurity and ecological ruin. This article contributes a critique of these rhetorical and discursive claims to a growing body of critical literature on precision agriculture. It argues precision agriculture is less a revolution than an evolution, an effort to shore up and intensify the conventional farming system responsible for generating many of the social and environmental problems precision agriculture is presented as solving. While precision agriculture advocates portray it as a radical, even democratic epistemological break with the past, this paper locates truth claims surrounding datafication and algorithmic control in farming within deeper historical contexts of the capitalist rationalization of production and efforts to quantify and automate physical and mental labor. Abjuring the growing cultural tendency to treat algorithmic systems as revolutionary in favor of social and historical dimensions of precision agriculture, can help re-frame the discussion about its design and use around real, socially and ecologically oriented change in farming, and so ensure that the possibilities and benefits of precision agriculture are as evenly and effectively shared as possible.",

        "title": "Protein disorder prediction by condensed PSSM considering propensity for order or disorder",
        "abstract": "BackgroundMore and more disordered regions have been discovered in protein sequences, and many of them are found to be functionally significant. Previous studies reveal that disordered regions of a protein can be predicted by its primary structure, the amino acid sequence. One observation that has been widely accepted is that ordered regions usually have compositional bias toward hydrophobic amino acids, and disordered regions are toward charged amino acids. Recent studies further show that employing evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) improves the prediction accuracy of protein disorder. As more and more machine learning techniques have been introduced to protein disorder detection, extracting more useful features with biological insights attracts more attention.ResultsThis paper first studies the effect of a condensed position specific scoring matrix with respect to physicochemical properties (PSSMP) on the prediction accuracy, where the PSSMP is derived by merging several amino acid columns of a PSSM belonging to a certain property into a single column. Next, we decompose each conventional physicochemical property of amino acids into two disjoint groups which have a propensity for order and disorder respectively, and show by experiments that some of the new properties perform better than their parent properties in predicting protein disorder. In order to get an effective and compact feature set on this problem, we propose a hybrid feature selection method that inherits the efficiency of uni-variant analysis and the effectiveness of the stepwise feature selection that explores combinations of multiple features. The experimental results show that the selected feature set improves the performance of a classifier built with Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) in comparison with the feature set constructed with PSSMs or PSSMPs that adopt simply the conventional physicochemical properties.ConclusionDistinguishing disordered regions from ordered regions in protein sequences facilitates the exploration of protein structures and functions. Results based on independent testing data reveal that the proposed predicting model DisPSSMP performs the best among several of the existing packages doing similar tasks, without either under-predicting or over-predicting the disordered regions. Furthermore, the selected properties are demonstrated to be useful in finding discriminating patterns for order/disorder classification.",

The proposed conceptual and methodological approach to machine learning of the process of assessing human capital of enterprises, taking into account the cognitive psychology of man and reflective attitudes in the human environment, can increase the effectiveness of decision-making in the field of human capital development management. The training involves indicators of return on investment in the individual, in the types of components of human capital, which are characterized by properties (creativity, competence, purposefulness, communication, motivation), where between their varieties there are appropriate reflective relationships. The main difficulty of this approach to the choice of alternative solutions for finding options for the use of human capital is the correct selection of indicators of significance (return) of contributions to the development of types of human capital, on the basis of which cycles occur of systemic learning. This approach can simplify the search for and developments of human capital development strategies, present alternative ways, and simplify management decisions.",

        "title": "Comparison of Residual Network-50 and Convolutional Neural Network Conventional Architecture For Fruit Image Classification",
        "abstract": "Classification of fruit images using machine learning technology has had a significant impact on human life by enabling accurate recognition of various fruits. With the advancements in technology, machine learning architectures have become increasingly diverse and sophisticated, providing enhanced capabilities for fruit image classification. However, previous studies have primarily focused on classifying fruits at a basic level. Therefore, there is a growing need for the development and application of Fruit Image Classification systems within the community, particularly in the field of agriculture. Such applications can play a pivotal role in leveraging technology to benefit the agricultural sector, empowering users to gain satisfaction and knowledge regarding different fruits through the utilization of these applications. In this study, we employ both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and a Residual Network-50 for fruit image classification. To ensure robust performance evaluation, the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, with fruits categorized into specific classes. Furthermore, identical preprocessing and optimization techniques are applied to both architectures to maintain consistency and fairness during the evaluation process. The results of our classification experiments on a dataset consisting of 17 different fruit classes reveal that the conventional CNN architecture achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.998 (99%) with a minimal loss of 0.009. On the other hand, the Residual Network-50 demonstrates a slightly lower accuracy of 0.994 (99%) but with a slightly higher loss of 0.02. Despite the higher loss, the Residual Network-50's accuracy remains comparable to that of the conventional architecture, showcasing its potential for fruit image classification. By leveraging the power of machine learning and these advanced architectures, fruit image classification systems can provide valuable insights and assistance to users. They can facilitate informed decision-making in various domains, including agriculture, food production, and consumer education.",

        "abstract": "Computational modeling of chemical and biological systems at atomic resolution is a crucial tool in the chemist\u2019s toolset. The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations. Computational modelling of chemical systems requires a balance between accuracy and computational cost. Here the authors use transfer learning to develop a general purpose neural network potential that approaches quantum-chemical accuracy for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions.",

        "abstract": "In the Internet age, social media has fully penetrated into people's lives. As one of the well-developed online platforms with a large user base, Reddit allows users to independently publish current news, life experiences, and interesting life stories. However, sometimes it sends a negative tone that affects the brand of a company or individual and destroys profits and it is necessary to prevent Twitter by identifying hate words. The biggest innovation of this post is that we use reddit data to compare various methods simultaneously. As we process more data, trying deep learning will yield good results. Compared to other machine learning classifiers, the transformer classifier achieves the best results.",

        "abstract": "In this research, we aimed to perform a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of immune cell infiltration in osteoarthritic cartilage and synovium and identify potential risk genes. Datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We integrated the datasets, removed the batch effects and analyzed immune cell infiltration along with differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the positively correlated gene modules. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-cox regression analysis was performed to screen the characteristic genes. The intersection of the DEGs, characteristic genes and module genes was identified as the risk genes. The WGCNA analysis demonstrates that the blue module was highly correlated and statistically significant as well as enriched in immune-related signaling pathways and biological functions in the KEGG and GO enrichment. LASSO-cox regression analysis screened 11 characteristic genes from the hub genes of the blue module. After the DEG, characteristic gene and immune-related gene datasets were intersected, three genes, PTGS1, HLA-DMB and GPR137B, were identified as the risk genes in this research. In this research, we identified three risk genes related to the immune system in osteoarthritis and provide a feasible approach to drug development in the future.",

        "abstract": "There are many phishing websites detection techniques in literature, namely white-listing, black-listing, visual-similarity, heuristic-based, and others. However, detecting zero-hour or newly designed phishing website attacks is an inherent property of machine learning and deep learning techniques. By considering a promising solution of machine learning and deep learning techniques, researchers have made a great deal of effort to tackle the this problem, which persists due to attackers constantly devising novel strategies to exploit vulnerability or gaps in existing anti-phishing measures. In this study, an extensive effort has been made to rigorously review recent studies focusing on Machine Learning and Deep Learning Based Phishing Websites Detection to excavate the root cause of the aforementioned problems and offer suitable solutions. The study followed the significant criterion to search, download, and screen relevant studies, then to evaluate criterion-based selected studies. The findings show that significant research gaps are available in the rigorously reviewed studies. These gaps are mainly related to imbalanced dataset usage, improper selection of dataset source(s), the unjustified reason for using specific train-test dataset split ratio, scientific disputes on website features inclusion and exclusion, lack of universal consensus on phishing website lifespans and on what is defining a small dataset size, and run-time analysis issues. The study clearly presented a summary of the comparative analysis performed on each reviewed research work so that future researchers could use it as a structured guideline to develop a novel solution for anti-phishing website attacks.",

        "title": "River flow prediction based on improved machine learning method: Cuckoo Search-Artificial Neural Network",
        "abstract": "One of the largest hydropower facilities currently in operation in Malaysia is the Terengganu hydroelectric facility. As a result, for hydropower generation to be sustainable, future water availability in hydropower plants must be known. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely estimate how the river flow will alter as a result of changing rainfall patterns. Finding the best value for the hyper-parameters is one of the problems with machine learning algorithms, which have lately been adopted by many academics. In this research, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is integrated with a nature-inspired optimizer, namely Cuckoo search algorithm (CS-ANN). The performance of the proposed algorithm then will be examined based on statistical indices namely Root-Mean-Square Error (RSME) and Determination Coefficient ( R 2 ). Then, the accuracy of the proposed model will be then examined with the stand-alone Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The statistical indices results indicate that the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model showed an improvement based on R 2 value as compared to ANN model with R 2 of 0.900 at training stage and R 2 of 0.935 at testing stage. RMSE value, for ANN model, is 127.79 m 3 /s for training stage and 12.7 m 3 /s at testing stage. While for the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model, RMSE value is equal to 121.7 m 3 /s for training stage and 10.95 m 3 /s for testing stage. The results revealed that the proposed model outperformed the stand-alone model in predicting the river flow with high level of accuracy. Although the proposed model could be applied in different case study, there is a need to tune the model internal parameters when applied in different case study.",

        "abstract": "At present, the determination of tunnel parameters mainly rely on engineering experience and human judgment, which leads to the subjective decision of parameters and an increased construction risk. Machine learning algorithms could provide an objective theoretical basis for tunnel parameter decision making. However, due to the limitations of a machine learning model\u2019s performance and parameter selection methods, the prediction model had poor prediction results and low reliability for parameter research. To solve the above problems, based on a large number of construction parameters of a composite section subway in Shenzhen, this paper combined dimensionality reduction data with service analysis to optimize the selection process of shield tunneling parameters, and determined the total propulsion force, cutter head torque, cutter head speed, and advance rate as key tunneling parameters. Based on an LGBM algorithm and Bayesian optimization, the prediction model of key tunneling parameters of an earth pressure balance shield was established. The results showed that the average error of the LGBM model on the test set was 8.18%, the average error of the cutter head torque was 13.93%, the average error of the cutter head speed was 3.16%, and the average error of advance rate was 13.35%. Compared with the RF model, the prediction effect and the generalization on the test set were better. Therefore, an LGBM algorithm could be used as an effective prediction method for tunneling parameters in tunnel construction and provide guidance for the setting of tunneling parameters.",

        "title": "Political Opinion Analysis in Social Networks: Case of Twitter and Facebook",
        "abstract": "The 21st century has been characterized by an increased attention to social networks. Nowadays, going 24 hours without getting in touch with them in some way has become difficult. Facebook and Twitter, these social platforms are now part of everyday life. Thus, these social networks have become important sources to be aware of frequently discussed topics or public opinions on a current issue. A lot of people write messages about current events, give their opinion on any topic and discuss social issues more and more. The emergence and enormous popularity of these social networks have led to the emergence of several types of analysis to take advantage of them. One of them is the analysis of opinions in texts. It aims at automatically classifying opinions in order to position them on a sentiment scale, thus allowing to characterize a set of opinions without having to rely on a human to read them. Currently, opinion analysis offers us a lot of information related to public opinion, either in the commercial world or in the political world. Many studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB), perform well in this type of classification. In our study, we first propose an approach for tracking and analyzing political opinions in social networks. Then, we propose a trained and evaluated machine learning model for political opinion classification. And finally, the study aims at setting up a web interface to collect and analyze in real time political opinions from social networks",

        "abstract": "With the pressing need to improve the poorly rated transportation infrastructure, asset managers leverage predictive maintenance strategies to lower the life cycle costs while maximizing or maintaining the performance of highways. Hence, the limitations of prediction models can highly impact prioritizing maintenance tasks and allocating budget. This study aims to investigate the potential of different predictive models in reaching an effective and efficient maintenance plan. This paper reviews the literature on predictive analytics for a set of highway assets. It also highlights the gaps and limitations of the current methodologies, such as subjective assumptions and simplifications applied in deterministic and probabilistic approaches. This article additionally discusses how these shortcomings impact the application and accuracy of the methods, and how advanced predictive analytics can mitigate the challenges. In this review, we discuss how advancements in technologies coupled with ever-increasing computing power are creating opportunities for a paradigm shift in predictive analytics. We also propose new research directions including the application of advanced machine learning to develop extensible and scalable prediction models and leveraging emerging sensing technologies for collecting, storing and analyzing the data. Finally, we addressed future directions of predictive analysis associated with the data-rich era that will potentially help transportation agencies to become information-rich.",

        "abstract": "The paper compares classical models for determining the thermophysical properties of steels based primarily on empirical equations derived using linear regression methods with models created using machine learning methods. The selected investigated quantities include phase transformation temperatures, specific heat capacity, coefficient of thermal expansion. The results of both approaches are verified on the measured data by methods of thermal analysis such as differential scanning calorimetry, differential thermal analysis and dilatometry. The methods are evaluated both in terms of the accuracy of predictions and in terms of the adequacy of use for a specific purpose, or in terms of the complexity of creating and using the model.",

        "abstract": "High-dimensional datasets often display heterogeneity due to heteroskedasticity or other forms of non-location-scale covariance effects. When the size of datasets becomes very large, it may be infeasible to store all of the high-dimensional datasets on one machine, or at least to keep the datasets in memory. In this paper, we consider penalized expectile regression using smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and adaptive LASSO penalties, which can effectively detect the heteroskedasticity of high-dimensional data. We propose a communication-efficient approach for distributed sparsity learning, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines. By selecting the appropriate tuning parameters, we show that the proposed estimators display oracle properties. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Anemia is a state of poor health where there is presence of low amount of red blood cell in blood stream. This research aims to design a model for prediction of Anemia in children under 5 years of age using Complete Blood Count reports. Data are collected from Kanti Children Hospital which consist of 700 data records. Then they are preprocessed, normalized, balanced and selected machine learning algorithms were applied. It is followed by verification, validation along with result analysis. Random Forest is the best performer which showed accuracy of 98.4%. Finally, Feature Selection as well as Ensemble Learning methods, Voting, Stacking, Bagging and Boosting were applied to improve the performance of algorithms. Selecting the best performer algorithm, stacking with other algorithms, bagging it, boosting it are very much crucial to improve accuracy despite of any time issue for prediction of anemia in children below 5 years of age.",

This analysis represents the first of its kind in estimating the spatiotemporal patterns in the Bull\u2019s Trench Kilns across the Brick Belt, as well as its connections with various UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With a principal focus on Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7 regarding the effective measures to end modern slavery by 2030, the article provides additional evidence on the intersections that exist between SDG 8.7 and those relating to urbanisation (SDG 11, 12), environmental degradation and pollution (SDG 3, 14, 15), and climate change (SDG 13). Our findings are then used to make a series of pragmatic suggestions for mitigating the most extreme SDG risks associated with brick production in ways that can improve human lives and human freedom.",

        "title": "Smoothed Analysis of Belief Propagation for Minimum-Cost Flow and Matching",
        "abstract": "Belief propagation (BP) is a message-passing heuristic for statistical inference in graphical models such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields. BP is used to compute marginal distributions or maximum likelihood assignments and has applications in many areas, including machine learning, image processing, and computer vision. However, the theoretical understanding of the performance of BP is unsatisfactory. Recently, BP has been applied to combinatorial optimization problems. It has been proved that BP can be used to compute maximum-weight matchings and minimum-cost flows for instances with a unique optimum. The number of iterations needed for this is pseudo-polynomial and hence BP is not efficient in general. We study belief propagation in the framework of smoothed analysis and prove that with high probability the number of iterations needed to compute maximum-weight matchings and minimum-cost flows is bounded by a polynomial if the weights/costs of the edges are randomly perturbed. To prove our upper bounds, we use an isolation lemma by Beier and Vocking (SIAM J. Comput., 2006) for matching and generalize an isolation lemma for min-cost flow by Gamarnik, Shah, and Wei (Oper. Res., 2012). We also prove almost matching lower tail bounds for the number of iterations that BP needs to converge.",

        "title": "Forecasting solar photosynthetic photon flux density under cloud cover effects: novel predictive model using convolutional neural network integrated with long short-term memory network",
        "abstract": "Forecast models of solar radiation incorporating cloud effects are useful tools to evaluate the impact of stochastic behaviour of cloud movement, real-time integration of photovoltaic energy in power grids, skin cancer and eye disease risk minimisation through solar ultraviolet (UV) index prediction and bio-photosynthetic processes through the modelling of solar photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). This research has developed deep learning hybrid model (i.e., CNN-LSTM) to factor in role of cloud effects integrating the merits of convolutional neural networks with long short-term memory networks to forecast near real-time (i.e., 5-min) PPFD in a sub-tropical region Queensland, Australia. The prescribed CLSTM model is trained with real-time sky images that depict stochastic cloud movements captured through a total sky imager (TSI-440) utilising advanced sky image segmentation to reveal cloud chromatic features into their statistical values, and to purposely factor in the cloud variation to optimise the CLSTM model. The model, with its competing algorithms (i.e., CNN, LSTM, deep neural network, extreme learning machine and multivariate adaptive regression spline), are trained with 17 distinct cloud cover inputs considering the chromaticity of red, blue, thin, and opaque cloud statistics, supplemented by solar zenith angle (SZA) to predict short-term PPFD. The models developed with cloud inputs yield accurate results, outperforming the SZA-based models while the best testing performance is recorded by the objective method (i.e., CLSTM) tested over a 7-day measurement period. Specifically, CLSTM yields a testing performance with correlation coefficient r\u2009=\u20090.92, root mean square error RMSE\u2009=\u2009210.31 \u03bc mol of photons m\u22122 s\u22121, mean absolute error MAE\u2009=\u2009150.24 \u03bc mol of photons m\u22122 s\u22121, including a relative error of RRMSE\u2009=\u200924.92% MAPE\u2009=\u200938.01%, and Nash Sutcliffe\u2019s coefficient ENS\u2009=\u20090.85, and Legate and McCabe\u2019s Index LM\u2009=\u20090.68 using cloud cover in addition to the SZA as an input. The study shows the importance of cloud inclusion in forecasting solar radiation and evaluating the risk with practical implications in monitoring solar energy, greenhouses and high-value agricultural operations affected by stochastic behaviour of clouds. Additional methodological refinements such as retraining the CLSTM model for hourly and seasonal time scales may aid in the promotion of agricultural crop farming and environmental risk evaluation applications such as predicting the solar UV index and direct normal solar irradiance for renewable energy monitoring systems.",

        "title": "Fine-Grained Named Entity Recognition Using a Multi-Stacked Feature Fusion and Dual-Stacked Output in Korean",
        "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task to identify spans that mention named entities and to annotate them with predefined named entity classes. Although many NER models based on machine learning have been proposed, their performance in terms of processing fine-grained NER tasks was less than acceptable. This is because the training data of a fine-grained NER task is much more unbalanced than those of a coarse-grained NER task. To overcome the problem presented by unbalanced data, we propose a fine-grained NER model that compensates for the sparseness of fine-grained NEs by using the contextual information of coarse-grained NEs. From another viewpoint, many NER models have used different levels of features, such as part-of-speech tags and gazetteer look-up results, in a nonhierarchical manner. Unfortunately, these models experience the feature interference problem. Our solution to this problem is to adopt a multi-stacked feature fusion scheme, which accepts different levels of features as its input. The proposed model is based on multi-stacked long short-term memories (LSTMs) with a multi-stacked feature fusion layer for acquiring multilevel embeddings and a dual-stacked output layer for predicting fine-grained NEs based on the categorical information of coarse-grained NEs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed model is capable of state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the proposed model can effectively alleviate the unbalanced data problem that frequently occurs in a fine-grained NER task. In addition, the multi-stacked feature fusion layer contributes to the improvement of NER performance, confirming that the proposed model can alleviate the feature interference problem. Based on this experimental result, we conclude that the proposed model is well-designed to effectively perform NER tasks.",

        "abstract": "Many mobile electronics devices, including smartphones and tablets, require the user to interact physically with the device via tapping the touchscreen. Conveniently, these compact devices are also equipped with high-precision transducers such as accelerometers and microphones, integrated mechanically and designed on-board to support a range of user functionalities. However, unintended access to these transducer signals (bypassing normal on-board data access controls) may allow sensitive user interaction information to be detected and thereby exploited. In this study, we show that acoustic features extracted from the on-board microphone signals, supported with accelerometer and gyroscope signals, may be used together with machine learning techniques to successfully determine the user\u2019s touch input location on a touchscreen: our ensemble model, namely the random forest model, predicts touch input location with up to 86% accuracy in a realistic scenario. Accordingly, we present the approach and techniques used, the performance of the model developed, and also discuss limitations and possible mitigation methods to thwart possible exploitation of such unintended signal channels.",

        "abstract": "We investigate techniques for supervised domain adaptation for neural machine translation where an existing model trained on a large out-of-domain dataset is adapted to a small in-domain dataset. In this scenario, overfitting is a major challenge. We investigate a number of techniques to reduce overfitting and improve transfer learning, including regularization techniques such as dropout and L2-regularization towards an out-of-domain prior. In addition, we introduce tuneout, a novel regularization technique inspired by dropout. We apply these techniques, alone and in combination, to neural machine translation, obtaining improvements on IWSLT datasets for English\u2192German and English\u2192Russian. We also investigate the amounts of in-domain training data needed for domain adaptation in NMT, and find a logarithmic relationship between the amount of training data and gain in BLEU score.",

        "abstract": "In perfusion MRI, image voxels form a spatially organized network of systems, all exchanging indicator with their immediate neighbors. Yet the current paradigm for perfusion MRI analysis treats all voxels or regions\u2010of\u2010interest as isolated systems supplied by a single global source. This simplification not only leads to long\u2010recognized systematic errors but also fails to leverage the embedded spatial structure within the data. Since the early 2000s, a variety of models and implementations have been proposed to analyze systems with between\u2010voxel interactions. In general, this leads to large and connected numerical inverse problems that are intractible with conventional computational methods. With recent advances in machine learning, however, these approaches are becoming practically feasible, opening up the way for a paradigm shift in the approach to perfusion MRI. This paper seeks to review the work in spatiotemporal modelling of perfusion MRI using a coherent, harmonized nomenclature and notation, with clear physical definitions and assumptions. The aim is to introduce clarity in the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art of this promising new approach to perfusion MRI, and help to identify gaps of knowledge and priorities for future research.",

        "abstract": "CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) is a membrane protein involved in lipid metabolism and has been linked to pathological conditions associated with metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. A case-control study was conducted and included 177 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 173 control subjects to study the involvement of CD36 gene rs1761667 (G>A) and rs1527483 (C>T) polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of T2DM and dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Lipid profile, blood sugar, gender and age were measured and recorded. Also, genotyping analysis for both polymorphisms was performed. Following statistical analysis, 10 different neural networks and machine learning (ML) tools were used to predict subjects with diabetes or dyslipidemia. Towards further understanding of the role of CD36 protein and gene in T2DM and dyslipidemia, a protein-protein interaction network and meta-analysis were carried out. For both polymorphisms, the genotypic frequencies were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). On the other hand, some ML tools like multilayer perceptron gave high prediction accuracy (\u2265 0.75) and Cohen\u2019s kappa (\u03ba) (\u2265 0.5). Interestingly, in K-star tool, the accuracy and Cohen\u2019s \u03ba values were enhanced by including the genotyping results as inputs (0.73 and 0.46, respectively, compared to 0.67 and 0.34 without including them). This study confirmed, for the first time, that there is no association between CD36 polymorphisms and T2DM or dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Prediction of T2DM and dyslipidemia, using these extensive ML tools and based on such input data, is a promising approach for developing diagnostic and prognostic prediction models for a wide spectrum of diseases, especially based on large medical databases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A deeper analysis on Comparative Quality Estimation is presented by extending the state-of-the-art methods with adequacy and grammatical features from other Quality Estimation tasks. The previously used linear method, unable to cope with the augmented features, is replaced with a boosting classifier assisted by feature selection. The methods indicated show improved performance for 6 language pairs, when applied on the output from MT systems developed over 7 years. The improved models compete better with reference-aware metrics. Notable conclusions are reached through the examination of the contribution of the features in the models, whereas it is possible to identify common MT errors that are captured by the features. Many grammatical/fluency features have a good contribution, few adequacy features have some contribution, whereas source complexity features are of no use. The importance of many fluency and adequacy features is language-specific.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Road geometry is pertinent information in various GIS studies. Reliable and updated road information thus calls for conventional on-site survey being replaced by more accurate and efficient remote sensing technology. Generally, this approach involves image enhancement and extraction of relevant features, such as elongate gradient and intersecting corners. Thus far, its implication is often impeded by wrongly extraction of other urban peripherals with similar pixel characteristics. This paper therefore proposes the fusion of THEOS satellite image and topographic derivatives, obtained from underlying Digital Surface Models (DSM). Multi-spectral indices in thematic layers and surface properties of designated roads were both fed into state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The results were later fused, taken into account consistently leveled road surface. The proposed technique was thus able to eliminate irrelevant urban structures such as buildings and other constructions, otherwise left by conventional index based extraction. The numerical assessment indicates recall of 84.64%, precision of 97.40% and overall accuracy of 97.78%, with 0.89 Kappa statistics. Visual inspection reported herewith also confirms consistency with ground truth reference.",

        "abstract": "Raising the threat of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks means that high and adapted detection tools are required now more than ever. This research focuses on exploring the latest solutions in preventing DDoS attacks and emphasizes how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is involved in enhancing end-to-end detection techniques. Through the analysis of several key approaches, this work notes that AI-guided models quickly identify and counteract any unusual traffic patterns that may indicate an oncoming DDoS attack. Essential aspects towards creating more resilient networks against such attacks include machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data analytics together with AI based detection systems for traffic pattern recognition. Importantly, AI does well in behavioral analysis because it can distinguish and adapt to changing attack vectors. Additionally, it puts AI into perspective as making positive mitigation strategies possible that contain quick interferences such as temporary halt of traffic, rerouting and targeted block listing with real time control panel operations. On the contrary, current DDoS detection prevention techniques remain critically addressed of persistent challenges and limitations fundamental to them. From what emerges, they should always be ready for innovation and improvement because of how attacks might evolve over time. This paper aligns itself with the position that AI-driven detection mechanisms are natural to network security against DDoS attacks. It underlines the importance of integrating AI-based solutions with conventional practices in order to enhance network resilience and efficiently counteract cyber threats that are evolving all the time.",

        "abstract": "Multi-physical field sensing and machine learning have drawn great attention in various fields such as sensor networks, robotics, energy devices, smart buildings, intelligent system and so on. In this paper, we present a novel efficient method for thermal and energy management based on bimodal airflow-temperature sensing and reinforcement learning, which expedites an exploration process by self-learning and adjusts action policy only through actuators interacting with the environment, being free of the controlled object model and priori experiences. In general, training of reinforcement learning requires a large amount of data iterations, which takes a long time and is not suitable for real-time control. Here, we propose an approach to speed up the learning process by indicating the action adjustment direction. We adopt tailor-designed bimodal sensors to simultaneously detect airflow and temperature field, which provides comprehensive information for reinforcement learning. The proposed thermal and energy management incorporates bimodal parametric sensing with an improved actor-critic algorithm to realize self-learning control. Experiments of thermal and energy management in a multi-module integrated system validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which demonstrate high efficiency, fast response, and good robustness in various control scenarios. The proposed methodology can be widely applied to thermal and energy management of diverse integrated systems.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts motor functions. Early and accurate detection of PD is crucial for effective treatment and management. This research explores the application of machine learning techniques to detect Parkinson's disease using vocal features from the UCI Parkinson's Disease Data Set. The study compares the performance of four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with each model evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrix metrics. The Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier achieved perfect accuracy on the training set, while the SVM model demonstrated the highest accuracy (89.74%) on the test set with a recall rate of 96.77%. These findings indicate that machine learning models, particularly SVM, can effectively contribute to the early detection of Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract": "\n The satellite imagery classification task is fundamental to spatial knowledge discovery. Land Cover and Land usage (LULC) maps are created using a variety of image classification techniques, making it easier to conduct research on spatial and ecological processes as well as human activities. One of the most well-known applications of geographical monitoring is LULC classification. Owing to its improved feature learning and feature expression capacity, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has made several breakthroughs in feature extraction as well as classification of multispectral images in recent times as compared with conventional machine learning approaches. But on the other hand, standard CNN models have certain disadvantages, for instance, a large number of layers, which contribute to difficult computing costs. The Hybrid Enriched Stacked Auto Encoder and Pre-Activated Residual Convolutional Neural Network combined with a Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (HESAE-FFO-MPARCNN) has formulated where FFO used to optimise parameters and thus enhance the accuracy of classification in this work to tackle this issue. The designed FFO-MPARCNN model with its modified hyperparameters produces higher classical models as PB-RNN, ResNet and FHS-DBN for computational efficiency and accuracy of classification.",

        "abstract": "Although social media has become the most widely utilized and active form of communication, research on its usage in crisis management is still in its early stages. As a result, this research examines the rising body of knowledge on social media and crisis management. [1] Between October 2017 and January 2018, a review was conducted, which included locating and retrieving records from an electronic database. The outcomes of this study indicated that the rise of social media has altered the landscape of crisis communication by allowing for greater engagement. However, due to its nature, social media might also be used to spark a crisis. This means that the crisis can be both produced and disseminated through social media. Nonetheless, social media's promise as a crisis-resolution tool is undeniable. It has the capability of proving a claim, dispelling false rumors, or just demonstrating a fact. As a result, practitioners should understand how social media works and how to best use it to interact with their stakeholders. This study also includes other findings, limits, and useful suggestions for scholars and practitioners interested in learning more about the role of social media on crisis communication and management. As most of the crisis problem were reported via twitter. However, most of the problem reported and corresponding responses via twitter were not successfully exchanged between victim\u2019s and resource organization. As a result, most of the tweets were not getting help. Thus, we designed a platform where people can avail the resources of crisis through tweets matching concept using machine learning.",

        "title": "The advantage of intergenic regions as genomic features for machine-learning-based host attribution of Salmonella Typhimurium from the USA",
        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica is a taxonomically diverse pathogen with over 2600 serovars associated with a wide variety of animal hosts including humans, other mammals, birds and reptiles. Some serovars are host-specific or host-restricted and cause disease in distinct host species, while others, such as serovar S. Typhimurium (STm), are generalists and have the potential to colonize a wide variety of species. However, even within generalist serovars such as STm it is becoming clear that pathovariants exist that differ in tropism and virulence. Identifying the genetic factors underlying host specificity is complex, but the availability of thousands of genome sequences and advances in machine learning have made it possible to build specific host prediction models to aid outbreak control and predict the human pathogenic potential of isolates from animals and other reservoirs. We have advanced this area by building host-association prediction models trained on a wide range of genomic features and compared them with predictions based on nearest-neighbour phylogeny. SNPs, protein variants (PVs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles and intergenic regions (IGRs) were extracted from 3883 high-quality STm assemblies collected from humans, swine, bovine and poultry in the USA, and used to construct Random Forest (RF) machine learning models. An additional 244 recent STm assemblies from farm animals were used as a test set for further validation. The models based on PVs and IGRs had the best performance in terms of predicting the host of origin of isolates and outperformed nearest-neighbour phylogenetic host prediction as well as models based on SNPs or AMR data. However, the models did not yield reliable predictions when tested with isolates that were phylogenetically distinct from the training set. The IGR and PV models were often able to differentiate human isolates in clusters where the majority of isolates were from a single animal source. Notably, IGRs were the feature with the best performance across multiple models which may be due to IGRs acting as both a representation of their flanking genes, equivalent to PVs, while also capturing genomic regulatory variation, such as altered promoter regions. The IGR and PV models predict that ~45\u200a% of the human infections with STm in the USA originate from bovine, ~40\u200a% from poultry and ~14.5\u200a% from swine, although sequences of isolates from other sources were not used for training. In summary, the research demonstrates a significant gain in accuracy for models with IGRs and PVs as features compared to SNP-based and core genome phylogeny predictions when applied within the existing population structure.

        "title": "Improving depth-of-interaction resolution in pixellated PET detectors using neural networks",
        "abstract": "Parallax error is a common issue in high-resolution preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) scanners as well as in clinical scanners that have a long axial field of view (FOV), which increases estimation uncertainty of the annihilation position and therefore degrades the spatial resolution. A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction (DOI) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network (NN), as well as a multiple linear regression (MLR)-based method to estimate DOI in depolished PET detector arrays with single-sided readout. The algorithms were tested on an 8\u00d7 8 array of 1.53\u00d7 1.53\u00d7 15 mm3 crystals and a 4\u00d7 4 array of 3.1\u00d7 3.1\u00d7 15 mm3 crystals, both made of Ce:LYSO scintillators and coupled to a 4\u00d7 4 array of 3\u00d7 3 mm3 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Using the conventional linear DOI estimation method resulted in an average DOI resolution of 3.76 mm and 3.51 mm FWHM for the 8\u00d7 8 and the 4\u00d7 4 arrays, respectively. Application of MLR outperformed the conventional method with average DOI resolutions of 3.25 mm and 3.33 mm FWHM, respectively. Using the machine learning approaches further improved the DOI resolution, to an average DOI resolution of 2.99 mm and 3.14 mm FWHM, respectively, and additionally improved the uniformity of the DOI resolution in both arrays. Lastly, preliminary results obtained by using only a section of the crystal array for training showed that the NN-based methods could be used to reduce the number of calibration steps required for each detector array.",

        "abstract": "This research proposes a stacking machine learning method to accurately predict the compressive strength of recycled concrete. The model integrates eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Extra Trees (ET), Decision Tree (DT), and Linear Regression (LR) models, aiming to maximize the prediction accuracy of concrete compressive strength. The model was evaluated using a combination of 63 self-made recycled concrete datasets and 1030 concrete datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Through optimization based on SHAP values, the new model achieved statistical metrics of RMSE = 1.969, MAE = 1.113, and R2 = 0.987. The comparison and analysis with the existing work show that this method has excellent performance. Additionally, the feature importance analysis based on SHAP values identified the key input variables affecting concrete compressive strength and improved the model\u2019s prediction performance.",

        "abstract": "The amount of data residing in social media currently untapped is certainly limitless as millions of people are constantly posting a message or the other to public forums on the internet. Twitter being one of the largest social media networks with over 336 million monthly active users has proven to be a fertile ground for harvesting opinion from multiple people. This work explores how opinion can be extracted from tweets to discover people\u2019s view concerning a certain subject matter. It focuses mainly on overcoming the limitation of the current approach to social media sentiment based mining for decision making which is that opinions derived from multiple sources are limited to available connections on the social media platforms and lack of improved accuracy of mined opinions. In order to achieve this, the proposed framework provides a platform to mine opinions from more than the available friends and connections on the social media platform and in addition, improve the quality of the opinion mined by implementing supervised learning algorithms with learning by induction in Twitter data analysis. In this research, three different supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to a dataset curated by graduate students at Stanford in order to accurately classify tweets into either positive or negative sentiment based on its content. It was discovered that Maximum Entropy had the highest accuracy of 83.5% among the three algorithms. The research has provided a web application which would enable users such as CEOs, Market Analysts, and random users make quality decision based on others\u2019 opinions.",

        "abstract": "With the growth in the communication systems, opinions became the most used communication method in the corporates, research and education. Nevertheless, with the increasing popularity the challenge for all internet service providers is to keep matching the demand for bandwidth. The major challenge to keep the bandwidth up to the usage is dealing with the spam messages. A spam communication or review is something that the sender uses for promotion and for the received may be useless. Thus for the receiver the messages are mostly unimportant. The detection of the spam reviews cannot be done at the review server end and need to done at the receiver side. Failing in detecting the spam can easily overload the review communication channel and reduce the effective use of the bandwidth. A number of researchers are carried out in order to detect the spam messages by deploying the filters. The outcomes are partially satisfactory as most of the parallel researches have demonstrated the rejection of the documents based on the pre-defined keywords. Nonetheless, these methods are not satisfactory as the use of words for every review writer may vary. As a result influenced by certain keywords, the receiver may lose some important communications. Thus the demand of the modern research is to enhance the detection of the spam reviews by using enhanced techniques rather than only depending on the keywords. This work proposes a novel automated framework powered by machine learning technique to detect the keywords and improve the detection by deploying context detection methods. The major outcome of this work is to build and demonstrate an automated framework for review spam detection with review rejection filters. The work outcomes into a highly satisfactory detection rate and demonstrate a sustainable model.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding RNA that play regulatory roles in a wide variety of biological processes, such as plant growth and abiotic stress responses. Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. To address the class imbalance problem (few real miRNAs and a large number of pseudo miRNAs), the prediction models in miRLocator were optimized by considering critical (and often ignored) factors that can markedly affect the prediction accuracy of mature miRNAs, including the machine learning algorithm and the ratio between training positive and negative samples. Ten-fold cross-validation on 5854 experimentally validated miRNAs from 19 plant species showed that miRLocator performed better than the state-of-art miRNA predictor miRdup in locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. miRLocator will aid researchers interested in discovering miRNAs from model and non-model plant species.",

        "title": "Identifying novel transcript biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using RNA-Seq datasets and machine learning",
        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the world owing to limitations in its prognosis. The current prognosis approaches include radiological examination and detection of serum biomarkers, however, both have limited efficiency and are ineffective in early prognosis. Due to such limitations, we propose to use RNA-Seq data for evaluating putative higher accuracy biomarkers at the transcript level that could help in early prognosis. To identify such potential transcript biomarkers, RNA-Seq data for healthy liver and various HCC cell models were subjected to five different machine learning algorithms: random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Na\u00efve Bayes, support vector machine, and neural networks. Various metrics, namely sensitivity, specificity, MCC, informedness, and AUC-ROC (except for support vector machine) were evaluated. The algorithms that produced the highest values for all metrics were chosen to extract the top features that were subjected to recursive feature elimination. Through recursive feature elimination, the least number of features were obtained to differentiate between the healthy and HCC cell models. From the metrics used, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of the known protein biomarkers for HCC is comparatively lower than complete transcriptomics data. Among the different machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector machine demonstrated the best performance. Using recursive feature elimination on top features of random forest and support vector machine three transcripts were selected that had an accuracy of 0.97 and kappa of 0.93. Of the three transcripts, two were protein coding (PARP2\u2013202 and SPON2\u2013203) and one was a non-coding transcript (CYREN-211). Lastly, we demonstrated that these three selected transcripts outperformed randomly taken three transcripts (15,000 combinations), hence were not chance findings, and could then be an interesting candidate for new HCC biomarker development. Using RNA-Seq data combined with machine learning approaches can aid in finding novel transcript biomarkers. The three biomarkers identified: PARP2\u2013202, SPON2\u2013203, and CYREN-211, presented the highest accuracy among all other transcripts in differentiating the healthy and HCC cell models. The machine learning pipeline developed in this study can be used for any RNA-Seq dataset to find novel transcript biomarkers. Code: www.github.com/rajinder4489/ML_biomarkers",

        "abstract": "Increased attention is being given to air pollution in recent times. This study investigated and analyzed particulate matter data from Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Jeollanam-do, with a particular focus on PM2.5. Descriptive statistics, box-and-whisker plots, correlation matrices, time variations, and trend analyses were performed for this purpose. Additionally, a prediction model for PM2.5 concentrations was developed using machine learning techniques, through which future changes in air quality were forecasted. \nCalculations were performed using R-based programs and R packages. Hourly PM2.5 data were obtained from air quality monitoring sites in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon. After data preprocessing, the optimal prediction model was constructed using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine from various machine learning algorithms. \nThe research results showed that there was more PM2.5 pollution in Gwangyang compared to Yeosu and Suncheon. The PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly across each monitoring site. Among the monitoring sites, the Yeosu site showed a higher correlation in PM2.5 with each other than other sites. Late winter and early spring showed higher PM2.5 concentrations, while summer and autumn showed lower concentrations. Weekly PM2.5 concentration fluctuations were not significantly different. Daily fluctuations showed an increase in PM2.5 concentrations during times of traffic congestion and a decrease in the afternoon. During the research period, the trend of PM2.5 concentration was generally decreasing. \nThe accuracy of the prediction model through machine learning was over 90%, and it is expected to assist in establishing effective response strategies for future changes in air quality. This study provided an updated and useful evaluation of recent PM2.5 air quality in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Korea.",

        "abstract": "Sitting on a chair in an awkward posture or sitting for a long period of time is a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders. A postural habit that has been formed cannot be changed easily. It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children\u2019s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Na\u00efve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 \u00d7 8) inside children\u2019s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system.",

        "title": "Semantic textual similarity for modern standard and dialectal Arabic using transfer learning",
        "abstract": "Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is the task of identifying the semantic correlation between two sentences of the same or different languages. STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set.",

        "title": "Neuroimaging mechanisms of acupuncture on functional reorganization for post-stroke motor improvement: a machine learning-based functional magnetic resonance imaging study",
        "abstract": "Objective Motor recovery is crucial in stroke rehabilitation, and acupuncture can influence recovery. Neuroimaging and machine learning approaches provide new research directions to explore the brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms after stroke. We applied machine learning to predict the classification of the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for motor improvement and identify the neuroimaging features, in order to explore brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms for motor recovery after stroke. Methods In this study, 49 patients with unilateral motor pathway injury (basal ganglia and/or corona radiata) after ischemic stroke were included and evaluated the motor function by Fugl\u2013Meyer Assessment scores (FMA) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up sessions. Patients were divided by the difference between the twice FMA scores into one group showing minimal clinically important difference (MCID group, n\u2009=\u200928) and the other group with no minimal clinically important difference (N-MCID, n\u2009=\u200921). Machine learning was performed by PRoNTo software to predict the classification of the patients and identify the feature brain regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, a matched group of healthy controls (HC, n\u2009=\u200926) was enrolled. Patients and HC underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination in the resting state and in the acupuncture state (acupuncture at the Yanglingquan point on one side) to compare the differences in brain functional connectivity (FC) and acupuncture effects. Results Through machine learning, we obtained a balance accuracy rate of 75.51% and eight feature ROIs. Compared to HC, we found that the stroke patients with lower FC between these feature ROIs with other brain regions, while patients in the MCID group exhibited a wider range of lower FC. When acupuncture was applied to Yanglingquan (GB 34), the abnormal FC of patients was decreased, with different targets of effects in different groups. Conclusion Feature ROIs identified by machine learning can predict the classification of stroke patients with different motor improvements, and the FC between these ROIs with other brain regions is decreased. Acupuncture can modulate the bilateral cerebral hemispheres to restore abnormal FC via different targets, thereby promoting motor recovery after stroke.

        "abstract": "Abstract. Significance Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms have rapidly become much more widespread for numerous biomedical applications, including the diagnosis and categorization of disease and injury. Aim Here, we seek to characterize the recent growth of ML techniques that use imaging data to classify burn wound severity and report on the accuracies of different approaches. Approach To this end, we present a comprehensive literature review of preclinical and clinical studies using ML techniques to classify the severity of burn wounds. Results The majority of these reports used digital color photographs as input data to the classification algorithms, but recently there has been an increasing prevalence of the use of ML approaches using input data from more advanced optical imaging modalities (e.g., multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography), in addition to multimodal techniques. The classification accuracy of the different methods is reported; it typically ranges from \u223c70% to 90% relative to the current gold standard of clinical judgment. Conclusions The field would benefit from systematic analysis of the effects of different input data modalities, training/testing sets, and ML classifiers on the reported accuracy. Despite this current limitation, ML-based algorithms show significant promise for assisting in objectively classifying burn wound severity.",

        "title": "Heart Rate Variability Based Estimation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake in Athletes Using Supervised Regression Models",
        "abstract": "Wearable Heart Rate monitors are used in sports to provide physiological insights into athletes\u2019 well-being and performance. Their unobtrusive nature and ability to provide reliable heart rate measurements facilitate the estimation of cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes, as quantified by maximum consumption of oxygen uptake. Previous studies have employed data-driven models which use heart rate information to estimate the cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes. This signifies the physiological relevance of heart rate and heart rate variability for the estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. In this work, the heart rate variability features that were extracted from both exercise and recovery segments were fed to three different Machine Learning models to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of 856 athletes performing Graded Exercise Testing. A total of 101 features from exercise and 30 features from recovery segments were given as input to three feature selection methods to avoid overfitting of the models and to obtain relevant features. This resulted in the increase of model\u2019s accuracy by 5.7% for exercise and 4.3% for recovery. Further, post-modelling analysis was performed to remove the deviant points in two cases, initially in both training and testing and then only in training set, using k-Nearest Neighbour. In the former case, the removal of deviant points led to a reduction of 19.3% and 18.0% in overall estimation error for exercise and recovery, respectively. In the latter case, which mimicked the real-world scenario, the average R value of the models was observed to be 0.72 and 0.70 for exercise and recovery, respectively. From the above experimental approach, the utility of heart rate variability to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of large population of athletes was validated. Additionally, the proposed work contributes to the utility of cardiorespiratory fitness assessment of athletes through wearable heart rate monitors.",

        "abstract": "Approximately, one-third of all FDA-approved drugs target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, more knowledge of protein structure-activity correlation is required to improve the efficacy of the drugs targeting GPCRs. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict activation state and activity level of the receptors with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we applied this model to thousands of molecular dynamics trajectories to correlate residue-level conformational changes of a GPCR to its activity level. Finally, the most probable transition pathway between activation states of a receptor can be identified by using the state-activity information. In addition, with this model, we can associate the contribution of each amino acid to the activation process. Using this method we will be able to design drugs that mainly target principal amino acids driving the transition between activation states of GPCRs. Our advanced method is generalizable to all GPCR classes and provides mechanistic insight into the activation mechanism in the receptors.",

        "title": "Software Enhancement Effort Estimation using Stacking Ensemble Model within the Scrum Projects: A Proposed Web Interface",
        "abstract": ": The frequent changes in software projects may have an impact on the accuracy of the Software Enhancement Effort Estimation (SEEE) and hinder management of the software project. According to a survey on agile software estimation, the most common cost driver among effort estimation models is software size. In-deed, previous research works proved the effectiveness of the COSMIC Functional Size Measurement (FSM) method for efficiently measuring software functional size. It has been also observed that COSMIC sizing is an efficient standardized method for measuring not only software size but also the functional size of an enhancement that may occur during the scrum enhancement project. Intending to increase the SEEE accuracy the purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it attempts to construct a stacking ensemble model. Secondly, it intends to develop a localhost web application to automate the SEEE process. The constructed stacking ensemble model takes the functional Size of an enhancement or a functional change, denoted as FS(FC), as a primary independent variable. The stacking ensemble model combines three Machine Learning (ML) techniques: Decision Tree Regression, Linear Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Results show that the use of the FS(FC) as an input to SEEE using the stacking ensemble model provides significantly better results in terms of MAE (Mean Absolute Error) = 0.206, Mean Square Error (MSE) = 0.406, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.595.",

        "title": "Identification of Potential Sex-Specific Biomarkers in Pigs with Low and High Intramuscular Fat Content Using Integrated Bioinformatics and Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a key determinant of pork quality. Controlling the genetic and physiological factors of IMF and the expression patterns of various genes is important for regulating the IMF content and improving meat quality in pig breeding. Growing evidence has suggested the role of genetic factors and breeds in IMF deposition; however, research on the sex factors of IMF deposition is still lacking. The present study aimed to identify potential sex-specific biomarkers strongly associated with IMF deposition in low- and high-IMF pig populations. The GSE144780 expression dataset of IMF deposition-related genes were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in male and female low-IMF (162 DEGs, including 64 up- and 98 down-regulated genes) and high-IMF pigs (202 DEGs, including 147 up- and 55 down-regulated genes). Moreover, hub genes were screened via PPI network construction. Furthermore, hub genes were screened for potential sex-specific biomarkers using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator machine learning algorithm, and sex-specific biomarkers in low-IMF (troponin I (TNNI1), myosin light chain 9(MYL9), and serpin family C member 1(SERPINC1)) and high-IMF pigs (CD4 molecule (CD4), CD2 molecule (CD2), and amine oxidase copper-containing 2(AOC2)) were identified, and then verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in semimembranosus muscles. Additionally, the gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of hallmark gene sets were collectively performed on the identified biomarkers. Finally, the transcription factor-biomarker and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (biomarker) networks were predicted. The identified potential sex-specific biomarkers may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of IMF deposition and the beneficial foundation for improving meat quality in pig breeding.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral drill-core scanning adds value to exploration campaigns by providing continuous, high-resolution mineralogical data over the length of entire boreholes. However, multivariate mineralogical data must be transformed into lithological domains such that it is compatible with interpolation techniques and be usable for geomodeling. Manual interpretation of multivariate drill-core data is a challenging, time-consuming and subjective task, and automated or semi-automated approaches are needed. However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection. In this way, the correlation pattern between the variables is incorporated into the segmentation. The scalogram accurately locates the geological boundaries at depth and yields hierarchical geological domains with mineralogical composition characteristics. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a synthetic as well as a real multivariate dataset. The real dataset consists of mineral abundances derived from drill-core hyperspectral imaging data acquired in Elvira, a shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D. Our approach provides an automatic way to transform hyperspectral image-derived mineral maps into vertically coherent geological units that are appropriate inputs for 3D geological modeling workflows. Moreover, the method improves the boundary detection and geological domaining by making use of multivariate information.",

        "title": "Adaptive recognition of machining features in sheet metal parts based on a graph class-incremental learning strategy",
        "abstract": "The integration of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided process planning (CAPP), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems is significantly enhanced by employing deep learning-based automatic feature recognition (AFR) methods. These methods outperform traditional, rule-based approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of intersecting features. However, existing deep learning-based AFR methods face two major challenges. The initial challenge stems from the frequent utilization of voxelized or point-cloud representations of CAD models, resulting in the unfortunate loss of valuable geometric and topological information inherent in original Boundary representation (B-Rep) models. The second challenge involves the limitation of supervised deep learning methods in identifying machining features that are not present in the predefined dataset. This constraint renders them suboptimal for the continually evolving datasets of real industrial scenarios. To address the first challenge, this study introduces a graph-structured language, Multidimensional Attributed Face-Edge Graph (maFEG), crafted to encapsulate the intricate geometric and topological details of CAD models. Furthermore, a graph neural network, Sheet-metalNet, is proposed for the efficient learning and interpretation of maFEGs. To tackle the second challenge, a three-component incremental learning strategy is proposed: an initial phase of pre-training and fine-tuning, a prototype sampling-based replay, and a stage employing knowledge distillation for parameter regularization. The effectiveness of Sheet-metalNet and its complementary incremental learning strategy is evaluated using the open-source MFCAD++ dataset and the newly created SMCAD dataset. Experimental results show that Sheet-metalNet surpasses state-of-the-art AFR methods in machining feature recognition accuracy. Moreover, Sheet-metalNet demonstrates adaptability to dynamic dataset changes, maintaining high performance when encountering newly introduced features, thanks to its innovative incremental learning strategy.",

        "abstract": "Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) replenishes groundwater by artificially entering water into subsurface aquifers. This technology improves water storage, reduces over-extraction, and ensures water security in water-scarce or variable environments. MAR systems are complex, encompassing various components such as water storage, soil, meteorological factors, groundwater management (GWM), and receiving bodies. Over the past decade, the utilization of machine learning (ML) methodologies for MAR modeling and prediction has increased significantly. This review evaluates all supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and ensemble ML models employed to predict MAR factors and parameters, rendering it the most comprehensive contemporary review on this subject. This study presents a concise and integrated overview of MAR's most effective ML approaches, focusing on design, suitability for water quality (WQ) applications, and GWM. The paper examines performance measures, input specifications, and the variety of ML functions employed in GWM, and highlights prospects. It also offers suggestions for utilizing ML in MAR, addressing issues related to physical aspects, technical advancements, and case studies. Additionally, previous research on ML-based data-driven and soft sensing techniques for MAR is critically evaluated. The study concludes that integrating ML into MAR systems holds significant promise for optimizing WQ management and enhancing the efficiency of groundwater replenishment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Soluble solids content (SSC) is one of the main quality indicators of apples, and it is important to improve the precision of online SSC detection of whole apple fruit. Therefore, the spectral pre-processing method of spectral-to-spectral ratio (S/S), as well as multiple characteristic wavelength member model fusion (MCMF) and characteristic wavelength and non-characteristic wavelength member model fusion (CNCMF) methods, were proposed for improving the detection performance of apple whole fruit SSC by diffuse reflection (DR), diffuse transmission (DT) and full transmission (FT) spectra. The modeling analysis showed that the S/S- partial least squares regression models for all three mode spectra had high prediction performance. After competitive adaptive reweighted sampling characteristic wavelength screening, the prediction performance of all three model spectra was improved. The particle swarm optimization\u2013extreme learning machine models of MCMF and CNCMF had the most significant enhancement effect and could make all three mode spectra have high prediction performance. DR, DT, and FT spectra all had some prediction ability for apple whole fruit SSC, with FT spectra having the strongest prediction ability, followed by DT spectra. This study is of great significance and value for improving the accuracy of the online detection model of apple whole fruit SSC.",

        "title": "Statistical Machine Learning Methods to Handle Missing PHQ-8 Score \u2013 Assuming Missing at Random",
        "abstract": "Aims Missing data is a challenge that most researchers encounter. It is a concern that continues to be analyzed and addressed for solutions. Missing data occurs when there is no data stored for certain variables relating to participants. In health surveys, when participants answer in the form of \u201cI don't know\u201d or \u201cI'd prefer not to answer\u201d, these responses can, in many cases, be categorized as missing data responses from a participant in a specific category or question. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is an essential tool in healthcare and clinical settings to assess an individual's mental health, specifically related to symptoms of depression. The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with the total score obtained by summing the scores for each item. Higher PHQ-8 scores indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. We used empirical data from a previous study on depression symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease to study the effect of considering the answers \u201cI do not know\u201d and \u201cI prefer not to answer\u201d as missing values when estimating the percentage of depression using PHQ-8. Moreover, we studied the effect of the complete case analysis and multiple imputation on parameter estimates and confidence intervals. The outcome of this study aims to shed light on the development of missing data procedural knowledge and provide methodological support for public health decision-making when data with missing values are collected. Furthermore, this study aims to prevent the exclusion of missing data rather than to generate data. Methods A simulation study with 1000 replicates was performed. Four common statistical machine learning methods for handling missing values were included in this study. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-Means, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest (RF) imputations. Five clusters were used for KNN and K-mean. Likewise, five multiple imputations were used for the CART and RF methods. The simulation was based on publicly available data with available PHQ-8 data for 1096 subjects. In the simulation study and for each replication, multivariate missing values were generated using the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% proportions of missingness. The percent of depression was calculated using the PHQ-8 questionnaire and a comparison was made between estimated actual depression, complete-case analysis, KNN, Kmean, RF, and CART, respectively. Results The Median age of the subjects was 69 (interquartile range: 61\u201367) and more males (72.9%) than females were included in the data. The estimated actual depression was 16.8, whereas the estimated percentage of depression varies between 6.9\u201313.5, 16.2\u201316.7, 16.3\u201316.7, 16.6\u201316.7 and 16.7\u201316.8 for the complete case, KNN, Kmean, RF and CART respectively. Conclusion The results of this simulation study show that missing PHQ-8 data are best handled by applying multiple imputations based on CART or RF. However, using K-Means or KNN leads to a good estimate of the true percentage of depression. Furthermore, the results of this simulation study show that complete-case analysis leads to biased estimates of the true percentage of depression. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to address the problem of missing PHQ-8 data under the assumption of missing not at random.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Schema matching, a fundamental process in data integration, traditionally employs pairwise comparisons to discern semantic correspondences among elements in disparate schemas. However, recent developments underscore the necessity of concurrent matching of interconnected schemas, termed schema alignment, to reconcile heterogeneous elements. This paper presents SchemaLogix, an innovative machine learning-based approach for schema matching. SchemaLogix addresses challenges such as data scarcity and domain-specific constraints through an inventive bootstrapping method, autonomously generating extensive datasets. Furthermore, SchemaLogix capitalizes on inherent alignment context constraints to optimize learning and improve precision across varied schema structures. Additionally, SchemaLogix incorporates user contributions to validate chosen correspondences, refining outputs based on valuable feedback. Empirical evaluations establish SchemaLogix's superiority over traditional methods, achieving an exceptional maximum S1 score of 0.90. These results offer practical insights for real-world applications, substantially advancing data integration and interoperability endeavors.",

        "title": "Graph Search and its Application in Building Extraction from High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery",
        "abstract": "Man-made object recognition from remotely sensed imagery is not only scientifically challenging but also of significant practical importance for spatial data acquisition and update of geographic information system databases, mapping, cartography, image interpretation, military activities and other applications, etc. In the literature, a large amount of work that has been done in the field of high resolution image understanding focuses on the development of efficient and robust algorithms to detect and extract typical man-made objects, such as buildings and roads. Most methods for building extraction can be classified into two categories: edge-driven approaches and region-driven approaches. The edgedriven approaches usually involve a procedure of bottom-up processing of image primitive features, trying to link or group the linear features corresponding to a building to obtain building boundary. In a region-driven strategy, various methods, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, machine learning strategies and other traditional classification schemes in pattern recognition are employed to categorize the regions derived by segmentation based on region features. The following section briefly reviews the methodologies of these two categories available in the literature. Edge-driven methods, such as perceptual grouping and contour tracing, are widely used for building extraction in the literature. Perceptual organization (Mohan and Nevatia 1989) was used to detect and describe buildings in aerial images. There, linear features are firstly extracted and grouped into parallel lines. Parallel lines with aligned endpoints trigger the formation of a U structure. Two U structures trigger the formation of a rectangle hypothesis which is further filtered. Katartzis and Sahli (2008) proposed a method based on a stochastic image interpretation model, using a novel contour-based grouping hierarchy under the principles of perceptual organization. The BABE (Buildup Area Building Extraction) system (McKeown 1990) performed perceptual organization of lines and orthogonal corners into chains and rectangles to form building hypotheses that were further verified using shadow information. Lin and Nevatia (1998) derived the geometric relationship between building margin lines and building shadows analytically according to a general illumination model.",

        "title": "Battery Performance Evaluation through Decision Tree",
        "abstract": "This study addresses the pervasive concern surrounding battery performance degradation in electronic devices. While some attribute this decline to device aging, a significant portion of the population lacks awareness of the precise factors contributing to diminished battery efficiency. Consequently, the research investigates the factors related to battery performance, aiming to identify the determinants of reduced efficiency. Decision trees are used to meticulously analyze the intricate relationships between variables and discern the factors that respondents perceive as causative of diminished battery performance. This algorithm is chosen since, in predicting high-capacity lithium-ion battery performance, the decision tree outperforms other algorithms in machine learning in accuracy. The study elucidates diverse user preferences, with 55.38% favoring Android and 44.62% expressing a preference for iOS, indicating disparate perceptions of battery health: 61.54% consider their batteries as \"Good,\" while 38.46% acknowledge a decline. The decision tree analysis of 195 participants underscores the pronounced impact of prolonged usage on battery health, revealing that 95% maintain good battery performance. In contrast, 27.69% of Android users face reduced battery performance, emphasizing the need for targeted user education and Android manufacturers to prioritize device longevity. The ultimate objective is to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of battery performance in the context of device aging and its contributing factors and give some input to manufacturers and service providers.\u00a0",

        "abstract": "In many cases of machine learning, research suggests that the development of training data might have a higher relevance than the choice and modelling of classifiers themselves. Thus, data augmentation methods have been developed to improve classifiers by artificially created training data. In NLP, there is the challenge of establishing universal rules for text transformations which provide new linguistic patterns. In this paper, we present and evaluate a text generation method suitable to increase the performance of classifiers for long and short texts. We achieved promising improvements when evaluating short as well as long text tasks with the enhancement by our text generation method. Especially with regard to small data analytics, additive accuracy gains of up to 15.53% and 3.56% are achieved within a constructed low data regime, compared to the no augmentation baseline and another data augmentation technique. As the current track of these constructed regimes is not universally applicable, we also show major improvements in several real world low data tasks (up to +4.84 F1-score). Since we are evaluating the method from many perspectives (in total 11 datasets), we also observe situations where the method might not be suitable. We discuss implications and patterns for the successful application of our approach on different types of datasets.",

        "title": "Research Progress of Crop Disease Image Recognition Based on Wireless Network Communication and Deep Learning",
        "abstract": "The traditional digital image processing technology has its limitations. It requires manual design features, which consumes manpower and material resources, and identifies crops with a single type, and the results are bad. Therefore, to find an efficient and fast real-time disease image recognition method is very meaningful. Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that can automatically learn representative features to achieve better results in areas of image recognition. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use deep learning methods to identify crop pests and diseases and to find efficient and fast real-time image recognition methods of disease. Deep learning is a newly developed discipline in recent years. Its purpose is to study how to actively obtain a variety of feature representation methods from data samples and rely on data-driven methods, a series of nonlinear transformations are applied to finally collect the original data from specific to abstract, from general to specified semantics, and from low-level to high-level characteristic forms. This paper analyzes the classical and the latest neural network structure based on the theory of deep learning. For the problem that the network based on natural image classification is not suitable for crop pest and disease identification tasks, this paper has improved the network structure that can take care of both recognition speed and recognition accuracy. We discussed the influence of the crop pest and disease feature extraction layer on recognition performance. Finally, we used the inner layer as the main structure to be the pest and disease feature extraction layer by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the inner and global average pooling layers. We analyze various loss functions such as Softmax Loss, Center Loss, and Angular Softmax Loss for pest identification. In view of the shortcomings of difficulty in loss function training, convergence, and operation, making the distance between pests and diseases smaller and the distance between classes more greater improved the loss function and introduced techniques such as feature normalization and weight normalization. The experimental results show that the method can effectively enhance the characteristic expression ability of pests and diseases and thus improve the recognition rate of pests and diseases. Moreover, the method makes the pest identification network training simpler and can improve the pest and disease recognition rate better.",

        "abstract": "Accurate simulation of physical processes is crucial for the success of modern particle physics. However, simulating the development and interaction of particle showers with calorimeter detectors is a time consuming process and drives the computing needs of large experiments at the LHC and future colliders. Recently, generative machine learning models based on deep neural networks have shown promise in speeding up this task by several orders of magnitude. We investigate the use of a new architecture\u2014the Bounded Information Bottleneck Autoencoder\u2014for modelling electromagnetic showers in the central region of the Silicon-Tungsten calorimeter of the proposed International Large Detector. Combined with a novel second post-processing network, this approach achieves an accurate simulation of differential distributions including for the first time the shape of the minimum-ionizing-particle peak compared to a full Geant4 simulation for a high-granularity calorimeter with 27k simulated channels. The results are validated by comparing to established architectures. Our results further strengthen the case of using generative networks for fast simulation and demonstrate that physically relevant differential distributions can be described with high accuracy.",

Recognition of these phishing scams is a very testing issue on the grounds that phishing is predominantly a semantics based assault, which particularly manhandles human vulnerabilities, anyway not system or framework vulnerabilities. Phishing costs. As a product discovery plot, two primary methodologies are generally utilized: blacklists/whitelists and machine learning approaches. Every phishing technique has different parameters and type of attack. Using decision tree algorithm we find out whether the attack is legitimate or a scam. We measure this by grouping them with diverse parameters and features, thereby assisting the machine learning algorithm to edify.",

        "abstract": "The intent of this work was to investigate the feasibility of developing machine learning models for calculating values of airplane configuration design variables when provided time-series, mission-informed performance data. Shallow artificial neural networks were developed, trained, and tested using data pertaining to the blended wing body (BWB) class of aerospace vehicles. Configuration design parameters were varied using a Latin-hypercube sampling scheme. These data were used by a parametric-based BWB configuration generator to create unique BWBs. Performance for each configuration was obtained via a performance estimation tool. Training and testing of neural networks was conducted using a K-fold cross-validation scheme. A random forest approach was used to determine the values of predicted configuration design variables when evaluating neural network accuracy across a blended wing body vehicle survey. The results demonstrated the viability of leveraging neural networks in mission-dependent, inverse design of blended wing bodies. In particular, feed-forward, shallow neural network architectures yielded significantly better predictive accuracy than cascade-forward architectures. Furthermore, for both architectures, increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer increased the prediction accuracy of configuration design variables by at least 80%.",

        "title": "Automatic Evaluation of Strephenopodia Based on Plantar Pressure and Machine Learning: A Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "\n Purpose Stroke patients often suffer from strephenopodia because of high muscle tension or muscle spasms, which seriously affect their walking ability and rehabilitation. During the treatment of strephenopodia, there are practical demands for convenient, automatic, and quantitative assessments of the angle of strephenopodia. However, existing strephenopodia detection methods, including traditional clinical gait analysis, gait video analysis and plantar pressure systems, suffer from object obstruction or require complex setups. In this paper, we proposed a novel methodology for automatically predicting the angles of strephenopodia based on a gait analysis system using machine learning methods.Methods Plantar pressure distribution data from thirty healthy participants were recorded during walking on the Zebris FDM-THM instrumented treadmill and were processed to generate 15 gait features. The right ankle angles on the coronal plane were measured by the Vicon system to provide a detailed description and explanation of strephenopodia walking. Three machine learning methods were implemented to build stochastic function mapping from gait features to strephenopodia angles.Results This study showed good reliability and precision prediction of the angle of strephenopodia [determination coefficient (R2)\\(\\ge\\)0.80]. Gaussian process regression (GPR) exhibited the best regression performance [R2\u2009=\u20090.93, mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.67].Conclusion The study results showed that this strephenopodia-detection method is not only convenient to implement but also has high accuracy and outperforms previous reports. Measurements derived from the gait analysis system are proper estimators of the angle of strephenopodia and should be considered to improve diagnosis and assessment of the stroke population.",

A focus group meeting is a foundation for the target problem identification in the ARCA technique. This is compared to earlier RCA methodologies which rely on problem sampling for target problem discovery and high beginning costs. In this research, we suggest a na\u00efve Bayes based machine learning method for identifying the underlying causes of newly reported software issues, which will facilitate a quicker and more effective resolution of software bugs. The ARCA technique produced a large number of high-quality corrective actions while requiring a reasonable amount of effort. The strategy is an effective way to find new opportunities for process improvement and produce fresh process improvement ideas in contrast to the organization\u2019s corporate practices. In addition it is simple to utilize. Ultimately, we compared the methodology with other machine learning classifiers including support vector machine and decision tree.",

        "title": "High-fidelity retrieval from instantaneous line-of-sight returns of nacelle-mounted lidar including supervised machine learning",
        "abstract": "Abstract. Wind turbine applications that leverage nacelle-mounted\nDoppler lidar are hampered by several sources of uncertainty in the lidar\nmeasurement, affecting both bias and random errors. Two problems encountered\nespecially for nacelle-mounted lidar are solid interference due to\nintersection of the line of sight with solid objects behind, within, or in\nfront of the measurement volume and spectral noise due primarily to\nlimited photon capture. These two uncertainties, especially that due to\nsolid interference, can be reduced with high-fidelity retrieval techniques\n(i.e., including both quality assurance/quality control and subsequent\nparameter estimation). Our work compares three such techniques, including\nconventional thresholding, advanced filtering, and a novel application of\nsupervised machine learning with ensemble neural networks, based on their\nability to reduce uncertainty introduced by the two observed nonideal\nspectral features while keeping data availability high. The approach\nleverages data from a field experiment involving a continuous-wave (CW)\nSpinnerLidar from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) that provided\nscans of a wide range of flows both unwaked and waked by a field turbine.\nIndependent measurements from an adjacent meteorological tower within the\nsampling volume permit experimental validation of the instantaneous velocity\nuncertainty remaining after retrieval that stems from solid interference and\nstrong spectral noise, which is a validation that has not been performed\npreviously. All three methods perform similarly for non-interfered returns,\nbut the advanced filtering and machine learning techniques perform better\nwhen solid interference is present, which allows them to produce overall\nstandard deviations of error between 0.2 and 0.3\u2009m\u2009s\u22121, or a 1\u2009%\u201322\u2009%\nimprovement versus the conventional thresholding technique, over the rotor\nheight for the unwaked cases. Between the two improved techniques, the\nadvanced filtering produces 3.5\u2009% higher overall data availability, while\nthe machine learning offers a faster runtime (i.e., \u223c\u20091\u2009s\nto evaluate) that is therefore more commensurate with the requirements of\nreal-time turbine control. The retrieval techniques are described in terms\nof application to CW lidar, though they are also relevant to pulsed lidar.\nPrevious work by the authors (Brown and Herges, 2020) explored a novel\nattempt to quantify uncertainty in the output of a high-fidelity lidar\nretrieval technique using simulated lidar returns; this article provides\ntrue uncertainty quantification versus independent measurement and does so\nfor three techniques rather than\u00a0one.\n",

        "abstract": "Network public opinion is a mirror reflecting people\u2019s will, and evaluating its urgency can help to find hidden social crises. Research on public opinion in the field of machine learning usually focuses on micro-sentiment judgment, which is unable to offer support for the evaluation of public opinion events without additional data, and research from the perspective of artificial weighting has the disadvantage of the confusion of explanation. Judging the urgency of public opinion events is usually based on human perception, which is fuzzy and conforms to the attribute of fuzzy mathematics. Therefore, the index system in this paper was constructed in line with five principles, from which the weights were scientifically evaluated by integrating the DEMATEL and ANP model, and fuzzy mathematics was applied to determine the urgency level of public opinion. The result has three-fold significance. First, the index system constructed was more closely linked. Second, the integration of the DEMATEL and ANP weight calculating model took the interdependence of indicators fully into account. Third, fuzzy mathematics provided support for determining the public opinion crisis level, especially in the absence of immediate dissemination data.",

        "abstract": "Tracking plant water status is a critical step towards the adaptive precision irrigation management of processing tomatoes, one of the most important specialty crops in California. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from proximal sensors and the high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provide an opportunity to monitor the crop water status efficiently. Based on data from an experimental tomato field with intensive aerial and plant-based measurements, we developed random forest machine learning regression models to estimate tomato stem water potential (\u03c8 stem), (using observations from proximal sensors and 12-band UAV imagery, respectively, along with weather data. The proximal sensor-based model estimation agreed well with the plant \u03c8 stem with R 2 of 0.74 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.63 bars. The model included PRI, normalized difference vegetation index, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature and tracked well with the seasonal dynamics of \u03c8 stem across different plots. A separate model, built with multiple vegetation indices (VIs) from UAV imagery and weather variables, had an R 2 of 0.81 and MAE of 0.67 bars. The plant-level \u03c8 stem maps generated from UAV imagery closely represented the water status differences of plots under different irrigation treatments and also tracked well the temporal change among flights. PRI was found to be the most important VI in both the proximal sensor- and the UAV-based models, providing critical information on tomato plant water status. This study demonstrated that machine learning models can accurately estimate the water status by integrating PRI, other VIs, and weather data, and thus facilitate data-driven irrigation management for processing tomatoes.",

Modern machine learning techniques have improved the state of the art in computer vision and catalized re-thinking of key problems, such as recognition and tracking. In turn, vision has broadened the scope of machine learning, offering rich new challenges and highlighting the importance of representations. This special issue contains 15 papers at the intersection of vision and learning, most firmly rooted in both areas. The topics span a range of computer vision topics, from object recognition and tracking to lower-level visual tasks such as feature detection and finding contours and segments. The machine learning methods include discriminative and generative models, as well as both parametric and non-parametric representations. Since databases are proving to be crucial for progress in both machine learning and computer vision, we",

        "abstract": "Hand washing is the simplest and most effective gesture, when correctly performed, for the prevention of many infections. For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a washing procedure that guarantees effective and safe cleaning. This organization recommends that States promote this activity and monitor it continuously. Based on this fact, this article presents a work oriented to study the feasibility of identifying the moments in which a person carried out a hand washing, determining its beginning and duration, as well as if these washings were compliant with the WHO guidelines. The identification of washing moments is made through the analysis, by means of Machine Learning techniques, of the data that can be collected from the inertial sensors of the smartwatch the person is wearing. This study was carried out with the participation of 15 volunteers. Data was not only collected in controlled settings but, also, more than 600 hours of sensor measurements come from free-live conditions. The results of the study showed that it is feasible to build a solid solution based on the use of low cost wearables for the identification of washing moments. The solution is very effective (with F1 over 95%) with user-dependent models. Also, with user-independent models, the identification of WHO washings is also very effective (with F1 above 85%), but more limited in the detection of free washings (F1 around 55%).",

        "abstract": "Background Next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels for mature B-cell neoplasms (MBNs) are widely applied clinically but have yet to be routinely used in a manner that is suitable for subtype differential diagnosis. This study retrospectively investigated newly diagnosed cases of MBNs from our laboratory to investigate mutation landscapes in Chinese patients with MBNs and to combine mutational information and machine learning (ML) into clinical applications for MBNs, especially for subtype classification. Methods Samples from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database were collected for ML model construction and cases from our laboratory were used for ML model validation. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation Random Forest algorithm was used for ML model construction. Mutation detection was performed by NGS and tumor cell size was confirmed by cell morphology and/or flow cytometry in our laboratory. Results Totally 849 newly diagnosed MBN cases from our laboratory were retrospectively identified and included in mutational landscape analyses. Patterns of gene mutations in a variety of MBN subtypes were found, important to investigate tumorigenesis in MBNs. A long list of novel mutations was revealed, valuable to both functional studies and clinical applications. By combining gene mutation information revealed by NGS and ML, we established ML models that provide valuable information for MBN subtype classification. In total, 8895 cases of 8 subtypes of MBNs in the COSMIC database were collected and utilized for ML model construction, and the models were validated on the 849 MBN cases from our laboratory. A series of ML models was constructed in this study, and the most efficient model, with an accuracy of 0.87, was based on integration of NGS testing and tumor cell sizes. Conclusions The ML models were of great significance in the differential diagnosis of all cases and different MBN subtypes. Additionally, using NGS results to assist in subtype classification of MBNs by method of ML has positive clinical potential.",

Linked data allows you to build complex and varied relationships between objects and subjects of the real world. Unfortunately, modern big data processing systems and machine learning models are extremely poorly suited for working with such dynamically linked data, especially in the case of real-time systems.

        "abstract": "High-performance computing (HPC), according to its name, is traditionally oriented toward performance, especially the execution time and scalability of the computations. However, due to the high cost and environmental issues, energy consumption has already become a very important factor that needs to be considered. The paper presents a survey of energy-aware scheduling methods used in a modern HPC environment, starting with the problem definition, tackling various goals set up for this challenge, including a bi-objective approach, power and energy constraints, and a pure energy solution, as well as metrics related to the subject. Then, considered types of HPC systems and related energy-saving mechanisms are described, from multicore-processors/graphical processing units (GPU) to more complex solutions, such as compute clusters supporting dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), power capping, and other functionalities. The main section presents a collection of carefully selected algorithms, classified by the programming method, e.g., machine learning or fuzzy logic. Moreover, other surveys published on this subject are summarized and commented on, and finally, an overview of the current state-of-the-art with open problems and further research areas is presented.",

        "abstract": "\n \n \nChronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stage of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this, we proposed a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. In general we have six machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, classifier and feed forward neural network to establish models. In existing system random forest achieved the performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. In proposed system, By analysing the misjudgments generated by the above model, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron which could achieve an efficient accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis. \n \n \n",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and globally affects both genders. The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area\u2019s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease\u2019s onset. The findings underline the potential of machine learning to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and therapy planning while emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in artificial intelligence-based healthcare systems.",

        "abstract": "Background: The increase in powerful computers and technological devices as well as new forms of data analysis such as machine learning have resulted in the widespread availability of data science in healthcare. However, its role in organizations providing long-term care (LTC) for older people LTC for older adults has yet to be systematically synthesized. This analysis provides a state-of-the-art overview of 1) data science techniques that are used with data accumulated in LTC and for what specific purposes and, 2) the results of these techniques in researching the study objectives at hand.\nMethods: A scoping review based on guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute. PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched using keywords related to data science techniques and LTC. The screening and selection process was carried out by two authors and was not limited by any research design or publication date. A narrative synthesis was conducted based on the two aims.\nResults: The search strategy yielded 1,488 studies: 27 studies were included of which the majority were conducted in the US and in a nursing home setting. Text-mining/natural language processing (NLP) and support vector machines (SVMs) were the most deployed methods; accuracy was the most used metric. These techniques were primarily utilized for researching specific adverse outcomes including the identification of risk factors for falls and the prediction of frailty. All studies concluded that these techniques are valuable for their specific purposes.\nDiscussion: This review reveals the limited use of data science techniques on data accumulated in or by LTC facilities. The low number of included articles in this review indicate the need for strategies aimed at the effective utilization of data with data science techniques and evidence of their practical benefits. There is a need for a wider adoption of these techniques in order to exploit data to their full potential and, consequently, improve the quality of care in LTC by making data-informed decisions.",

        "title": "Predicting multiple sclerosis severity with multimodal deep neural networks",
        "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease developed in the human brain and spinal cord, which can cause permanent damage or deterioration of the nerves. The severity of MS disease is monitored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, composed of several functional sub-scores. Early and accurate classification of MS disease severity is critical for slowing down or preventing disease progression via applying early therapeutic intervention strategies. Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) create opportunities to apply data-driven and predictive modeling tools for this goal. Previous studies focusing on using single-modal machine learning and deep learning algorithms were limited in terms of prediction accuracy due to data insufficiency or model simplicity. In this paper, we proposed the idea of using patients\u2019 multimodal longitudinal and longitudinal EHR data to predict multiple sclerosis disease severity in the future. Our contribution has two main facets. First, we describe a pioneering effort to integrate structured EHR data, neuroimaging data and clinical notes to build a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict patient\u2019s MS severity. The proposed pipeline demonstrates up to 19% increase in terms of the area under the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) compared to models using single-modal data. Second, the study also provides valuable insights regarding the amount useful signal embedded in each data modality with respect to MS disease prediction, which may improve data collection processes.",

        "abstract": "The advancement of autonomous vehicles (AVs) heavily relies on their ability to process high volumes of sensor data and make real-time decisions. This paper explores how the integration of data engineering, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and a cohesive hardware-software approach can further enhance the performance and safety of AVs. We propose a comprehensive framework that leverages advanced data engineering techniques for efficient data management, employs state-of-the-art ML models for accurate perception and prediction, and utilizes AI- driven strategies for decision-making and control. The proposed solutions are designed to be effective in areas with limited internet connectivity and can operate on low- powered hardware, even with outdated software.",

        "abstract": "The article discusses the development of information systems of housing and communal services of the Russian Federation from the point of view of resource consumption data accounting and analysis. The object of the study is \"smart\" apartment buildings. The subject of the research is information platforms, information systems and individual software developments for monitoring resource consumption in apartment buildings. It is noted that the digitalization of housing and communal services is just beginning and mainly refers to new construction. There is a potential for using digital services to manage a \"smart\" apartment building, including for the organization of telemetry. Three levels of development of digital services for resource management are identified. The list of the main digital platforms supporting the telemetry function in apartment buildings is presented. The possibilities of integration of various automated information systems are discussed. It is noted that the analytical processing of housing and communal services information is focused on the traditional tasks of management companies, such as the formation of statistics and reporting on resource consumption. It is proposed to pay attention to machine learning methods and intelligent big data analysis technologies.",

        "abstract": "Creating computational biology models applicable to industry is much more difficult than it appears. There is a major gap between a model that looks good on paper and a model that performs well in the drug discovery process. We are trying to shrink this gap by introducing the Evaluation Framework For predicting Efficiency of Cancer Treatment (EFFECT) benchmark suite based on the DepMap and GDSC data sets to facilitate the creation of well-applicable machine learning models capable of predicting gene essentiality and/or drug sensitivity on in vitro cancer cell lines. We show that standard evaluation metrics like Pearson correlation are misleading due to inherent biases in the data. Thus, to assess the performance of models properly, we propose the use of cell line/perturbation exclusive data splits, perturbation-wise evaluation, and the application of our Bias Detector framework, which can identify model predictions not explicable by data bias alone. Testing the EFFECT suite on a few popular machine learning (ML) models showed that while library-standard non-linear models have measurable performance in splits representing precision medicine and target identification tasks, the actual corrected correlations are rather low, showing that even simple knock-out (KO)/drug sensitivity prediction is a yet unsolved task. For this reason, we aim our proposed framework to be a unified test and evaluation pipeline for ML models predicting cancer sensitivity data, facilitating unbiased benchmarking to support teams to improve on the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "Traditional sports in ethnic minority regions are a valuable cultural heritage. Regional ethnic traditional sports are not only a sports business but also a tourism resource. The construction of a reasonable regional sports tourism resource classification model is fundamental to the development of sports tourism resources. However, the existing sports tourism resources classification is mostly constructed manually based on the national standard tourism resources classification system. The efficiency and accuracy of the traditional manual classification are poor and cannot reflect the characteristics of regional ethnic traditional sports tourism. In order to solve the above problems, a machine learning-based classification method for regional ethnic traditional sports tourism resources is proposed. Firstly, the relevant concepts and characteristics of traditional sports tourism resources are introduced. Then, taking the development of traditional sports of ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province as the research object, SWOT analysis, literature, interview, questionnaire, and mathematical statistics are used to investigate and analyse the overall status of the development of regional ethnic traditional sports. Secondly, a classification evaluation method based on an optimised back-propagation (BP) neural network is proposed. Finally, the optimised BP neural network model is applied to the classification of traditional sports tourism resources. The experimental results show that the optimised BP model performs well in the classification of traditional sports tourism resources, verifying its effectiveness.",

        "title": "Robust vs. Non-robust radiomic features: the quest for optimal machine learning models using phantom and clinical studies",
        "abstract": "Purpose This study aimed to select robust features against lung motion in a phantom study and use them as input to feature selection algorithms and machine learning classifiers in a clinical study to predict the lymphovascular invasion (LVI) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results of robust features were also compared with conventional techniques without considering the robustness of radiomic features. Methods An in-house developed lung phantom was developed with two 22mm lesion sizes based on a clinical study. A specific motor was built to simulate motion in two orthogonal directions. Lesions of both clinical and phantom studies were segmented using a Fuzzy C-means-based segmentation algorithm. After inducing motion and extracting 105 radiomic features in 4 feature sets, including shape, first-, second-, and higher-order statistics features from each region of interest (ROI) of the phantom image, statistical analyses were performed to select robust features against motion. Subsequently, these robust features and a total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from 126 clinical data. Various feature selection (FS) and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers were implemented to predict the LVI of NSCLC, followed by comparing the results of predicting LVI using robust features with common conventional techniques not considering the robustness of radiomic features. Results Our results demonstrated that selecting robust features as input to FS algorithms and ML classifiers surges the sensitivity, which has a gentle negative effect on the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) of predictions compared with commonly used methods in 12 of 15 outcomes. The top performance of the LVI prediction was achieved by the NB classifier and RFE FS without considering the robustness of radiomic features with 95% area under the curve of AUC, 67% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, the top performance of the LVI prediction using robust features belonged to the NB classifier and Boruta feature selection with 92% AUC, 86% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Conclusion Robustness over various influential factors is critical and should be considered in a radiomic study. Selecting robust features is a solution to overcome the low reproducibility of radiomic features. Although setting robust features against motion in a phantom study has a minor negative impact on the accuracy and AUC of LVI prediction, it boosts the sensitivity of prediction to a large extent.",

The shaped charge jet analog comprises a copper liner, a high explosive (HE), and a silicone buffer. We apply a genetic algorithm to determine an optimal buffer design that can be placed between the liner and the HE that results in the largest possible change in jet velocity. The use of a genetic algorithm allows for discoveries of unintuitive, complex, yet optimal buffer designs. Experiments using the optimal design verified the effectiveness of the buffer and validated the machine learning approach to hydrodynamic design optimization.",

        "abstract": "The prediction of wave height is one of the major problems of coastal engineering and coastal structures. In recent years, advances in the prediction of significant wave height have been considerably developed using flexible calculation techniques. In addition to the traditional prediction of significant wave height, soft computing has explored a new way of predicting significant wave heights. This research was conducted in the direction of forecasting a significant wave height using machine learning approaches. In this paper, a problem of significant wave height prediction problem has been tackled by using wave parameters such as wave spectral density. This prediction of significant wave height helps in wave energy converters as well as in ship navigation system. This research will optimize wave parameters for a fast and efficient wave height prediction. For this Pearson\u2019s, Kendall\u2019s and Spearman\u2019s Correlation Coefficients and Particle Swarm Optimization feature reduction techniques are used. So reduced features are taken into consideration for prediction of wave height using neural network. In this work, performance evaluation metrics such as MSE and RMSE values are decreased and gives better performance of classification that is compared with existing research\u2019s implemented methodology. From the experimental results, it is observed that proposed algorithm gives the better prediction as compared to PSO feature reduction technique. So, it is also concluded that Co-relation enhanced neural network is better as compared to PSO based neural network with increased number of features.",

        "abstract": "Classifying images of Thai culture is important for a variety of applications, such as tourism, education, and cultural preservation. However, building a Machine learning model from scratch to classify Thai cultural images can be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data. In this study, we investigate the use of transfer learning for the task of image classification on a dataset of Thai cultural images. We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration. To better understand the reasoning behind the predictions made by the models, we deployed the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique to generate heatmaps that the models attend to when making predictions. Both our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrated that transfer learning is an effective approach to image classification on Thai cultural images.",

This is a difficult question that was addressed carefully in a recent paper that focused on the validity of the GRACE score to predict in-hospital mortality. (1) Why is this high-quality study by Mangariello and Gitelman important? Prediction models are increasingly published in the medical literature. Newer methods are proposed, such as labeled machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. Whatever the method of development, the key issue is whether the prediction model or algorithm provides valid predictions for physicians and their patients who rely on them as a source of information and decision making. Indeed, the authors rightly argue that many differences between settings may be present. These include differences in patient characteristics, healthcare systems, and socioeconomic environment. Moreover, treatment may change over time. All these differences may make a previously developed model not valid for the particular setting where the model is applied, for example the Dr. Juan A. Fern\u00e1ndez Hospital in Buenos Aires. Therefore, a model may need updating for a specific setting. (2)",

        "abstract": "In the DataBeach study a machine learning model was developed with the aim to improve the efficiency and sustainability of design of soft coastal defense projects. A morphological model based on machine learning was trained and tested to predict beach volume changes with significantly reduced computational time compared to traditional process-based models. The machine learning model was then applied, combined with a \u2018penalty function\u2019 for inclusion of morphological feedback, to predict beach volume changes for the study area of approximately 2 km alongshore and on a 10-year project timescale. In order to run many different scenarios for the 10-year prediction, a probabilistic methodology was developed to take into account the uncertainties in this time period. The machine learning-based model provides great benefits for probabilistic simulations, due to the lower computational time, compared to process-based numerical models such as XBeach, and a flexible way in which it can incorporate measurement data. The performance of the tested machine learning models was comparable to that of the short term volume predictions of XBeach. Comparison of 10-year predicted volume changes using the machine learning model and measured beach topography (LiDAR) showed good agreement between measured and predicted volume changes for the dry beach area (when accounting for nourishments), but overestimation in the beach volume change predictions for the intertidal beach. These differences are partially attributed to the poor performance on XBeach for long term, normal wave conditions, which are an important factor in the intertidal area.",

        "abstract": "Big data is the concept of enormous amounts of data being generated daily in different fields due to the increased use of technology and internet sources. Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors\u2019 names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.",

        "abstract": "Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals play an essential role in disease diagnosis and rehabilitation. This study applied a powerful machine learning algorithm called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to classify sEMG signals acquired from muscles around the knee for distinguishing patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) from healthy subjects. First, to improve data quality, we preprocessed the data via interpolation and normalization. Next, to ensure the description integrity of model input, we extracted nine time-domain features based on the statistical characteristics of sEMG signals over time. Finally, we classified the samples using XGBoost and cross-validation (CV) and compared the results to those produced by the support vector machine (SVM) and the deep neural network (DNN). Experimental results illustrate that the presented method effectively improves classification performance. Moreover, compared with the SVM and the DNN, XGBoost has higher accuracy and better classification performance, which indicates its advantages in the classification of patients with KOA based on sEMG signals.",

        "abstract": "Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causes chronic gastrointestinal tract inflammation. Thirty percent of patients do not respond to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Sialylation is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosing CD and predicting anti-TNF medication outcomes in CD. Three potential biomarkers (SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2) were screened using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning based on sialylation-related genes. Moreover, the combined model of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 showed excellent diagnostic value in both the training and validation cohorts. Importantly, a Sial-score was constructed based on the expression of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2. The Sial-low group showed a lower level of immune infiltration than the Sial-high group. Anti-TNF therapy was effective for 94.4% of patients in the Sial-low group but only 15.8% in the Sial-high group. The Sial-score had an outstanding ability to predict and distinguish between responders and non-responders. Our comprehensive analysis indicates that SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 play essential roles in pathogenesis and anti-TNF therapy resistance in CD. Furthermore, it may provide novel concepts for customizing treatment for individual patients with CD.",

        "abstract": "The catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts for the steam methane reforming (SMR) reaction was extensively studied previously. However, the performance of these materials in the presence of sulfur-containing species is yet to be investigated. In this study, we propose a novel process aided by machine learning (ML) and microkinetic modeling for the rapid screening of sulfur-resistant bimetallic catalysts. First, various ML models were developed to predict atomic adsorption energies (C, H, O, and S) on bimetallic surfaces. Easily accessible physical and chemical properties of the metals and adsorbates were used as input features. The Ensemble learning, artificial neural network, and support vector regression models achieved the best performance with R2 values of 0.74, 0.71, and 0.70, respectively. A microkinetic model was then built based on the elementary steps of the SMR reaction. Finally, the microkinetic model, together with the atomic adsorption energies predicted by the Ensemble model, were used to screen over 500 bimetallic materials. Four Ge-based alloys (Ge3Cu1, Ge3Ni1, Ge3Co1, and Ge3Fe1) and the Ni3Cu1 alloy were identified as promising and cost-effective sulfur-resistant catalysts.",

        "title": "Groundwater Level Forecasting Using Machine Learning: A Case Study of the Baekje Weir in Four Major Rivers Project, South Korea",
        "abstract": "Understanding the impact of human\u2010made structures on groundwater levels is essential, with structures like dams or weirs presenting unique challenges and opportunities for study. The Baekje weir in South Korea presents an interesting case as the weir has undergone full gate opening, which is generally not the case for weirs and reservoirs, providing valuable opportunity for simulating weir removal conditions. The main objectives are investigation of groundwater level fluctuations under various weir operations, distances from the weir, and seasonal variations. The study utilizes observed data that simulates conditions with and without the weir, including scenarios of full gate opening. Multiple machine learning algorithms\u2014Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)\u2014are used to develop accurate groundwater level prediction models. The models' performance is assessed using coefficient of determination, Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indices, and visualized through Taylor diagrams. Results indicate that XGBoost outperforms other models in all three groups during both training and testing phases. Specifically, XGBoost surpasses RF by 2.09% (R2), 5.66% (RMSE), and 10.1% (MAE) in training, and outperforms SVR by 11.2% (R2), 42.0% (RMSE), and 129.2% (MAE) in testing. Additionally, the study generates groundwater level maps, providing a practical tool for managing groundwater systems and informing decision\u2010making in weir operations. This study not only sheds light on the dynamic relationship between weir operations and groundwater levels but also provides actionable insights for effective water management in similar hydrological settings.",

        "title": "In-Bed Pose Estimation: Deep Learning With Shallow Dataset",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a robust human posture and body parts detection method under a specific application scenario known as in-bed pose estimation. Although the human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied extensively in the last few decades, the in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose estimation problems. However, the in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes with specific challenges, including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout the day and having pose distribution different from the common human surveillance viewpoint. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly reduce the effectiveness of the existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge, the infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with the unconventional pose perspective, a 2- end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. The deep learning framework proves to be the most effective model in human pose estimation; however, the lack of large public dataset for in-bed poses prevents us from using a large network from scratch. In this paper, we explored the idea of employing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-tuning the model using our own shallow (limited in size and different in perspective and color) in-bed IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-trained CNN called convolutional pose machine (CPM) was fine-tuned for in-bed pose estimation by re-training its specific intermediate layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.",

        "title": "Non-Interactive Decision Trees and Applications with Multi-Bit TFHE",
        "abstract": "Machine learning classification algorithms, such as decision trees and random forests, are commonly used in many applications. Clients who want to classify their data send them to a server that performs their inference using a trained model. The client must trust the server and provide the data in plaintext. Moreover, if the classification is done at a third-party cloud service, the model owner also needs to trust the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privately evaluating decision trees. The protocol uses a novel private comparison function based on fully homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) scheme and a programmable bootstrapping technique. Our comparison function for 32-bit and 64-bit integers is 26% faster than the naive TFHE implementation. The protocol is designed to be non-interactive and is less complex than the existing interactive protocols. Our experiment results show that our technique scales linearly with the depth of the decision tree and efficiently evaluates large decision trees on real datasets. Compared with the state of the art, ours is the only non-interactive protocol to evaluate a decision tree with high precision on encrypted parameters. The final download bandwidth is also 50% lower than the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "We present machine learning (ML) models for hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD) strengths. Quantum chemical (QC) free energies in solution for 1:1 hydrogen-bonded complex formation to the reference molecules 4-fluorophenol and acetone serve as our target values. Our acceptor and donor databases are the largest on record with 4426 and 1036 data points, respectively. After scanning over radial atomic descriptors and ML methods, our final trained HBA and HBD ML models achieve RMSEs of 3.8\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 (acceptors), and 2.3\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 (donors) on experimental test sets, respectively. This performance is comparable with previous models that are trained on experimental hydrogen bonding free energies, indicating that molecular QC data can serve as substitute for experiment. The potential ramifications thereof could lead to a full replacement of wetlab chemistry for HBA/HBD strength determination by QC. As a possible chemical application of our ML models, we highlight our predicted HBA and HBD strengths as possible descriptors in two case studies on trends in intramolecular hydrogen bonding.",

        "abstract": "\nThis study employs computational algorithms to automatically identify and classify features in X\u2010Ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy images. Principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian mixture (GM) clustering, are implemented to label features on a collection of XRF maps of human atherosclerotic plaque samples. The investigation involves the hard X\u2010Ray nanoprobe (NanoMAX) at MAX IV synchrotron radiation facility, utilizing scanning transmission X\u2010Ray microscopy (STXM) and XRF techniques. The analysis covers regions of interest scanned by the beam with a step size of 200\u2009nm, yielding XRF maps of elements like calcium, iron, and zinc. These maps reveal intricate structures unsuitable for manual labeling. However, they can be accurately classified in an automated fashion using GM. Prior to clustering, PCA is used to deal with repeated patterns and background areas. The resulting clusters are associated with different types of features, which can be identified as specific tissues confirmed by histology. Regions of high concentrations of phosphorus, sulfur, calcium, and iron are found in the samples. These regions are also observed in the STXM results as spots of low transmission that typically are associated with calcium deposits only.",

        "title": "Applying Hidden Markov Models to Voting Advice Applications",
        "abstract": "In recent times, a phenomenon that threatens the representative democracy of many developed countries is the low voter turnout. Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are used to inform citizens about the political stances of the parties that involved in the upcoming elections, in an effort to facilitate their decision making process and increase their participation in this democratic process. VAA is a Web application that calls the users and parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, which are based on the current affairs of their country and then it recommends to each user the party that better fits their political views. SVAAs, a social recommendation approach of VAAs, on the other hand, base their recommendation on the VAA community of users in a collaborative filtering manner. In this paper we resort to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of SVAAs. In particular, we try to model party-supporters using HMMs and then use these models to recommend each VAA user the party whose model best fits his/her answer sequence of the VAA policy statements. HMMs proved to be effective machine learning tools for sequential and correlated data and this is the main rationale behind this study. VAA policy statements are usually correlated and grouped into categories such as external policy, economy, society, etc. As a result, opting from the various answer choices in each policy statement might be related with selections in previous and subsequent policy statements. Given that the order of policy statements is kept fixed within each VAA one can assume that (a)\u00a0answer patterns (sequences of choices for all policy statements included in the VAA) can be found that characterise \u2018typical\u2019 voters of particular parties, and (b)\u00a0the answer choice in each policy statement can be \u2018predicted\u2019 from previous answer choices. For our experiments we use three datasets based on the 2014 elections to the European Parliament (http://www.euvox2014.eu/), which are publicly available through the Preference Matcher website (http://www.preferencematcher.org/?page_id=18).",

        "abstract": "This review paper explores the role of human taste panels and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in taste-masking paediatric drug formulations. Given the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges of employing children, young adults (18\u201340) can serve as suitable substitutes due to the similarity in their taste sensitivity. Taste panellists need not be experts in sensory evaluation so long as a reference product is used during evaluation; however, they should be screened for bitterness taste detection thresholds. For a more robust evaluation during the developmental phase, considerations of a scoring system and the calculation of an acceptance value may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of recommending a formulation for further development. On the technological front, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be exploited in taste-masking optimisation of medicinal formulations as they can model complex relationships between variables and enable predictions not possible previously to optimise product profiles. Machine learning classifiers may therefore tackle the challenge of predicting the bitterness intensity of paediatric formulations. While advancements have been made, further work is needed to identify effective taste-masking techniques for specific drug molecules. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms, using human panellist acceptability scores, can aid in enhancing paediatric formulation development and overcoming taste-masking challenges.",

        "abstract": "De novo membrane protein structure prediction is limited to small proteins due to the conformational search space quickly expanding with length. Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid separation)\u2013residue positions distant in sequence, but in close proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL::Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models folded was reduced by an average of 2 \u00c5 for a benchmark of 25 membrane proteins.",

        "abstract": "Background The immune system plays a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of sepsis, and autophagy and autophagy-related molecules are crucial in innate and adaptive immune responses; however, the potential roles of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in sepsis are not comprehensively understood. Methods A systematic search was conducted in ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts from July 2005 to May 2022. Machine learning approaches, including modified Lasso penalized regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were applied to identify hub ARGs, thereby developing a prediction model termed ARG classifier. Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the model was comprehensively analyzed using multi-transcriptome data. Subsequently, we systematically correlated the ARG classifier/hub ARGs with immunological characteristics of multiple aspects, including immune cell infiltration, immune and molecular pathways, cytokine levels, and immune-related genes. Further, we collected clinical specimens to preliminarily investigate ARG expression levels and to assess the diagnostic performance of ARG classifier. Results A total of ten GEO and three ArrayExpress datasets were included in this study. Based on machine learning algorithms, eight key ARGs (ATG4C, BAX, BIRC5, ERBB2, FKBP1B, HIF1A, NCKAP1, and NFKB1) were integrated to establish ARG classifier. The model exhibited excellent diagnostic values (AUC > 0.85) in multiple datasets and multiple points in time and superiorly distinguished sepsis from other critical illnesses. ARG classifier showed significant correlations with clinical characteristics or endotypes and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.70) than other clinical characteristics. Additionally, the identified hub ARGs were significantly associated with immune cell infiltration (B, T, NK, dendritic, T regulatory, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), immune and molecular pathways (inflammation-promoting pathways, HLA, cytolytic activity, apoptosis, type-II IFN response, complement and coagulation cascades), levels of several cytokines (PDGFRB, IL-10, IFNG, and TNF), which indicated that ARG classifier/hub ARGs adequately reflected the immune microenvironment during sepsis. Finally, using clinical specimens, the expression levels of key ARGs in patients with sepsis were found to differ significantly from those of control patients, and ARG classifier exhibited superior diagnostic performance, compared to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion Collectively, a diagnostic and prognostic model (ARG classifier) based on eight ARGs was developed which may assist clinicians in diagnosis of sepsis and recognizing patient at high risk to guide personalized treatment. Additionally, the ARG classifier effectively reflected the immune microenvironment diversity of sepsis and may facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background Conspiracy beliefs have become widespread throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have shown that endorsing conspiracy beliefs leads to lower protective guideline adherence (i.e., wearing face masks), posing a threat to public health measures. The current study expands this research across the lifespan, i.e., in a sample of adolescents with mental health problems. Here, we investigated the association between conspiracy beliefs and guideline adherence while also exploring the predictors of conspiracy beliefs. Methods N \u2009=\u200993 adolescent psychiatric outpatients (57% female, mean age: 15.8) were assessed using anonymous paper\u2013pencil questionnaires. Endorsement of generic and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was assessed, in addition to items measuring adherence to protective guidelines and mental health (stress, depressive symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and adverse childhood experiences). Multiple regressions and supervised machine learning (conditional random forests) were used for analyses. Results Fourteen percent of our sample fully endorsed at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory, while protective guidelines adherence was relatively high ( M \u2009=\u20094.92, on a scale from 1 to 7). The endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs\u2014but not of generic conspiracy beliefs\u2014was associated with lower guideline adherence (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.32, 95% CI \u2212\u00a00.53 to \u2212\u00a00.11, p \u2009<\u2009.001). Conditional random forests suggested that adverse childhood experiences and peer and conduct problems were relevant predictors of both conspiracy belief categories. Conclusion While a significant proportion of our sample of adolescents in psychiatric treatment endorsed conspiracy beliefs, the majority did not. Furthermore, and to some degree, contrary to public perception, we found that adolescents show relatively good adherence to public health measures\u2014even while experiencing a high degree of mental distress. The predictive value of adverse childhood experiences and peer/conduct problems for conspiracy beliefs might be explained by compensatory mechanisms to ensure the safety, structure, and inclusion that conspiracies provide.",

        "abstract": "Mechanistic cardiac electrophysiology models allow for personalized simulations of the electrical activity in the heart and the ensuing electrocardiogram (ECG) on the body surface. As such, synthetic signals possess known ground truth labels of the underlying disease and can be employed for validation of machine learning ECG analysis tools in addition to clinical signals. Recently, synthetic ECGs were used to enrich sparse clinical data or even replace them completely during training leading to improved performance on real-world clinical test data. We thus generated a novel synthetic database comprising a total of 16,900 12 lead ECGs based on electrophysiological simulations equally distributed into healthy control and 7 pathology classes. The pathological case of myocardial infraction had 6 sub-classes. A comparison of extracted features between the virtual cohort and a publicly available clinical ECG database demonstrated that the synthetic signals represent clinical ECGs for healthy and pathological subpopulations with high fidelity. The ECG database is split into training, validation, and test folds for development and objective assessment of novel machine learning algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Modern machine learning techniques, such as convolutional, recurrent and recursive neural networks, have shown promise for jet substructure at the Large Hadron Collider. For example, they have demonstrated effectiveness at boosted top or W boson identification or for quark/gluon discrimination. We explore these methods for the purpose of classifying jets according to their electric charge. We find that both neural networks that incorporate distance within the jet as an input and boosted decision trees including radial distance information can provide significant improvement in jet charge extraction over current methods. Specifically, convolutional, recurrent, and recursive networks can provide the largest improvement over traditional methods, in part by effectively utilizing distance within the jet or clustering history. The advantages of using a fixed-size input representation (as with the CNN) or a small input representation (as with the RNN) suggest that both convolutional and recurrent networks will be essential to the future of modern machine learning at colliders.",

        "abstract": "Human Activity-based studies have become an omnipresent research topic in Machine Learning. Considering the countless impacts of human activity on persons' everyday life, we have analyzed the correlation between human activity and their product preferences in our study and proposed that daily human activity could be a metric for product recommendation models. To address this previously unaccounted phenomenon, a new approach is presented in our study that gives real-time recommendations to users by observing their activeness in daily life. However, product recommendation systems mostly believe in ratings, and the purchase behavior of users instead of investigating the precious insights of users' daily activities. But we examined smartphones' GPS sensor data using machine learning algorithms to urge insights from users' daily activeness and proposed a model for predicting the product of interest of the purchasers, based on the activeness of their daily life. Moreover, based on our model, we have introduced a prototype of a real-time recommendation system, especially for the retail shops that rely on users' implicit data from smartphone sensors to form product recommendations. For conducting our study, we developed an android application that\u2014collects embedded smartphone sensor data and can detect objects to provide product recommendations and product details. Experiment shows, that our proffered daily activeness-based recommendation system using smartphone sensor data, performs with a precision of 66%, but it is also a promising performance because it does not use customers' explicit feedback.",

At the same time, the current computer technology is also very advanced, and many kinds of very powerful information technologies have been developed under the promotion and promotion of modern science and technology. Therefore, relevant personnel will carry out advanced technology and neural network structure methods. Fusion, and then an artificial neural network was established on this basis. In a broad sense, machine learning refers to how to enable a machine to acquire relevant knowledge through autonomous learning, and the purpose is to enable the machine to have relevant skills similar to what people need to acquire knowledge. The research in this article aims to explore the machine learning algorithms based on neural network technology, and through literature research methods, case analysis methods, etc., to have an in-depth understanding of machine learning algorithms in neural network technology, and then through the analysis of machine learning algorithms in neural network technology The learning advantage and its influencing factors are designed based on the machine learning algorithm in the neural network and experimented. Experimental results show that LSTM performs well in replication tasks, and the performance of LSTM even far exceeds that of NTM, but the performance of LSTM in addition and multiplication tasks is much lower than that of NTM. Although the accuracy of NTM on the test set is higher than that of LSTM and RNN, the performance of the model is still relatively poor.",

        "title": "Intelligent Citizenship Identity Through Family Pedigree Using Graph-Signature Based Random-Forest Model",
        "abstract": "There has been a global upsurge of interest in the topic of citizenship identity over the past decades, specifically in the world dominated by profound insecurity, inequalities, proliferation of identities, and rise of identity politics,engendered by capitalism. However finding effective solution to these problems has been rendered difficult. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents an analytical Machine learning model that suitably combined the graph signature with random forest techniques. This study presents the design and realization of a novel Intelligent Citizenship Identity through family pedigree using Graph Signature based random forest (GSB-RF) model. The study also showcases the development of a novel graph signature technique referred to as Canonical Code Signature(CCS) method. The CCS method is used at the pre-processing stage of the identification process to build signature for any given tuple. Performance comparisim between the present system and the baseline techniques which includes: the K-Nearest Neighbour and the traditional Random Forest shows that the present system outperformed the baseline method studied. The proposed system shows capability to perform continuous re-identification of Citizens based on their family pedigree with ability to select best sample with low computational complexity, high identification accuracy and speed. Our experimental result shows that the precision rate and identification quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%. Therefore, the proposed Citizenship Identification machine is capable of providing usable, consistent, efficient, faster and accurate identification, to the users, security agents, government agents and institutions on-line, real-time and at any-time.Keywords- Canonical code,Citizenship Identity, Family pedigree,Graph-Signature,Machine learning, Random-forest",

        "title": "Application of quantum computing to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model for novel medical knowledge discovery",
        "abstract": "Recently, the utilization of real-world medical data collected from clinical sites has been attracting attention. Especially as the number of variables in real-world medical data increases, causal discovery becomes more and more effective. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop new causal discovery algorithms suitable for small data sets for situations where sample sizes are insufficient to detect reasonable causal relationships, such as rare diseases and emerging infectious diseases. This study aims to develop a new causal discovery algorithm suitable for a small number of real-world medical data using quantum computing, one of the emerging information technologies attracting attention for its application in machine learning. In this study, a new algorithm that applies the quantum kernel to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, one of the causal discovery algorithms, is developed. Experiments on several artificial data sets showed that the new algorithm proposed in this study was more accurate than existing methods with the Gaussian kernel under various conditions in the low-data regime. When the new algorithm was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which the causal structure could be correctly estimated even when the amount of data was small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing the new algorithm on real quantum hardware was discussed. This study suggests that the new proposed algorithm using quantum computing might be a good choice among the causal discovery algorithms in the low-data regime for novel medical knowledge discovery.",

        "abstract": "Steatotic liver disease (SLD) is the most common cause of liver disease globally, with an ever-increasing burden. The two primary components of SLD are metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (ALD). Both entities have important knowledge gaps in differentiation, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognosis. Given the enormous burden of both MASLD and ALD and their diverse presentation, they form an ideal ground for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques and algorithms. ML models can aid in disease prediction among large populations and estimate those at the highest risk of disease progression or mortality, while applications with AI technology can aid in better detection and monitored treatment approaches. The use of AI in digital pathology and digital therapeutics are attractive options in moving toward personalized medicine. This review briefly summarizes the knowledge gaps in SLD with emerging literature on the use of ML and AI technologies across domains of disease detection, diagnosis, and prognosis.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing rate and types of cyber attacks against information systems and communication infrastructures, many tools are needed to detect and mitigate against such attacks, for example, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Unfortunately, traditional Signature\u2010based IDSs (SIDSs) perform poorly against previously unseen adversarial attacks. Anomaly\u2010based IDSs (AIDSs) use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to overcome these limitations. However, AIDS performance can be poor when trained on imbalanced datasets. To address the challenge of AIDS performance caused by these unbalanced training datasets, generative adversarial models are proposed to obtain adversarial attacks from one side and analyse their quality from another. According to extensive usage and reliability criteria for generative adversarial models in different disciplines, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) are employed to serve AIDS. The authors have extensively assessed their abilities and robustness to deliver high\u2010quality attacks for AIDS. AIDSs are constructed, trained, and tuned based on these models to measure their impacts. The authors have employed two datasets: NSL\u2010KDD and CICIDS\u20102017 for generalisation purposes, where ML and DL approaches are utilised to implement AIDSs. Their results show that the WGAN model outperformed GANs and BiGAN models in binary and multiclass classifications for both datasets.",

The complicated nonlinear dynamics of battery parameters is well captured by a flexible, efficient, and expressive structure of the Fourier neural operators. Extensive numerical experiments and tests with publicly available data as well as with our own data are conducted to demonstrate the noise-tolerance, time window independence, temperature generalization, and transfer learning features of the proposed method. Our proposed method performs better than the other methods considered previously its performances is competitive with any state-of-the-art machine learning-based methods.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a radar-based remote measurement system for classification of human behaviors and falls in restrooms without privacy invasion. Our system uses a dual Doppler radar mounted onto a restroom ceiling and wall. Machine learning methods, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, support vector machine, and random forest methods, are applied to the Doppler radar data to verify the model\u2019s efficiency and features. Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time\u2013velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar\u2019s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom. These findings indicate that daily restroom monitoring using the proposed radar system accurately recognizes human behaviors and allows early detection of fall accidents.",

        "abstract": "A bstractHigh-pT Higgs production at hadron colliders provides a direct probe of the internal structure of the gg \u2192 H loop with the H\u2192bb\u00af$$ H\\to b\\overline{b} $$ decay offering the most statistics due to the large branching ratio. Despite the overwhelming QCD background, recent advances in jet substructure have put the observation of the gg\u2192H\u2192bb\u00af$$ gg\\to H\\to b\\overline{b} $$ channel at the LHC within the realm of possibility. In order to enhance the sensitivity to this process, we develop a two-stream convolutional neural network, with one stream acting on jet information and one using global event properties. The neural network significantly increases the discovery potential of a Higgs signal, both for high-pT Standard Model production as well for possible beyond the Standard Model contributions. Unlike most studies for boosted hadronically decaying massive particles, the boosted Higgs search is unique because double b-tagging rejects nearly all background processes that do not have two hard prongs. In this context \u2014 which goes beyond state-of-the-art two-prong tagging \u2014 the network is studied to identify the origin of the additional information leading to the increased significance. The procedures described here are also applicable to related final states where they can be used to identify additional sources of discrimination power that are not being exploited by current techniques.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The objective of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for predict in-hospital mortality among critically ill patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) combined with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. Results This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm explains the individualized predictions. Conclusions In conclusion, our study accomplished the successful development and validation of ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with CHF combined with CKD. Notably, the XGBoost model emerged as the most efficacious among all the ML models employed.",

Structuring the face acknowledgment frameworks that are invariant to aging is difficult as biometric frameworks endures severely because of subjects aging. None of the current strategies are keeping pace with human capacity in perceiving the comparability crosswise over two appearances .In this paper age invariant highlights are determined utilizing Local binary patterns and Gaussian naive Bayes is utilized a classifier for generating matching score. The experimentation is done on the FGNET database and the experimentation results show an acknowledgment precision of 96% with naive Bayes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Traditional cancer classification based on organ of origin and histology is increasingly at odds with precision oncology. Tumors in different organs can share molecular features, while those in the same organ can be heterogeneous. This disconnect impacts clinical trials, drug development, and patient care. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning, offer promising avenues for reclassifying cancers through comprehensive integration of molecular, histopathological, imaging, and clinical characteristics. AI\u2010driven approaches have the potential to reveal novel cancer subtypes, identify new prognostic variables, and guide more precise treatment strategies for improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "This article presents perspective on the research challenge of understanding and synthesizing anthropomorphic whole-body contact motions through a platform called \u201cinteractive cyber-physical human (iCPH)\u201d for data collection and augmentation. The iCPH platform combines humanoid robots as \u201cphysical twins\u201d of human and \u201cdigital twins\u201d that simulates humans and robots in cyber-space. Several critical research topics are introduced to address this challenge by leveraging the advanced model-based analysis together with data-driven learning to exploit collected data from the integrated platform of iCPH. Definition of general description is identified as the first topic as a common basis of contact motions compatible to both humans and humanoids. Then, we set continual learning of a feasible contact motion network as the second challenge by benefiting from model-based approach and machine learning bridged by the efficient analytical gradient computation developed by the author and his collaborators. The final target is to establish a high-level symbolic system allowing automatic understanding and generation of contact motions in unexperienced environments. The proposed approaches are still under investigation, and the author expects that this article triggers discussions and further collaborations from different research communities, including robotics, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and biomechanics.",

Heuristic analysis of the process is used to define the attributes of influence to machining time. For the problem of estimating machining time the following \u201eNeural Computing techniques\u201c are used: Back-Propagation Neural Network, Modular Neural Network, Radial Basis Function Neural Network, General Regression Neural Network and Self-Organizing Map Neural Network. Real data from the technological process obtained by measuring are used to design the model used in investigation. The established model is used to carry out the investigation aimed at learning and testing different algorithms of neural networks and the results are given by the RMS error. The best results in the validation phase were achieved by Modular Neural Network ( RMSE : 1.89 %) and Back-Propagation Neural Network ( RMSE : 2.03 %) while the worst results were achieved by Self-Organizing Map Neural Network ( RMSE : 10.05 %).

        "abstract": "The rapid pace of development in western China has brought about inevitable concerns for environmental conditions and their management. The Sanjiangyuan National Park strives to address concerns for sustainable water resources management and biodiversity management, especially for the protection of endangered flora and fauna. In this study, a machine learning model (MaxEnt) was used to predict the human activity intensity and its effects on species in Sanjiangyuan protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The model used human settlements as input and datasets such as terrain factors, climate, and artificial structures as environmental factors. The results showed that human activity intensity was significantly different between the East and the West. The area with the highest human activity intensity was Yushu County in the south area, and Xinghai-Zeku County in the east. By comparing the mammal richness with human activity intensity, we found human\u2013wildlife coexistence in Sanjiangyuan. A detailed analysis on the CITES protected species showed that many important species, such as snow leopards, red pandas, and small Indian civets, occupied areas with high human activity intensity. The national park protects 3/4 CITES species with 1/3 in the area of the Sanjiangyuan region, owing to the relatively low human activity intensity.",

The conventional paradigm depends heavily on preprepared lists of known malicious domains, necessitating frequent updates to maintain relevance. However, this method shows inadequate in yet-to-be-cataloged malicious or domains identifying emerging, leading to potential vulnerabilities. Throughout this paper, a creative research endeavor is discussed to shed lights on presenting a cutting-edge DNS firewall solution that proves the power of Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

A reasonable assembled dataset, incorporating 34 intricate features and meticulously recorded instances totaling 90,000, was critically chosen from genuine DNS logs. Similarly, it becomes more riched through the careful integration of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) sources.

        "title": "A novel method for calculating ambient aerosol liquid water content based on measurements of a humidified nephelometer system",
        "abstract": "Abstract. Water condensed on ambient aerosol particles plays significant\nroles in atmospheric environment, atmospheric chemistry and climate. Before\nnow, no instruments were available for real-time monitoring of ambient\naerosol liquid water contents (ALWCs). In this paper, a novel method is\nproposed to calculate ambient ALWC based on measurements of a\nthree-wavelength humidified nephelometer system, which measures aerosol light\nscattering coefficients and backscattering coefficients at three wavelengths\nunder dry state and different relative humidity (RH) conditions, providing\nmeasurements of light scattering enhancement factor f (RH). The proposed ALWC calculation method includes two steps: the first\nstep is the estimation of the dry state total volume concentration of ambient\naerosol particles, Va (dry), with a machine\nlearning method called random forest model based on measurements of the\n\u201cdry\u201d nephelometer. The estimated Va (dry) agrees\nwell with the measured one. The second step is the estimation of the volume\ngrowth factor Vg(RH) of ambient aerosol\nparticles due to water uptake, using f (RH) and the\nAngstrom exponent. The ALWC is calculated from the\nestimated Va (dry) and Vg(RH). To validate the new method, the ambient ALWC calculated\nfrom measurements of the humidified nephelometer system during the Gucheng\ncampaign was compared with ambient ALWC calculated from ISORROPIA\nthermodynamic model using aerosol chemistry data. A good agreement was\nachieved, with a slope and intercept of 1.14 and \u2212 8.6\u2009 \u00b5 m 3 \u2009cm \u22123 ( r2 = \u20090.92), respectively. The\nadvantage of this new method is that the ambient ALWC can be obtained solely\nbased on measurements of a three-wavelength humidified nephelometer system,\nfacilitating the real-time monitoring of the ambient ALWC and promoting the\nstudy of aerosol liquid water and its role in atmospheric chemistry,\nsecondary aerosol formation and climate change.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we introduce a two-dimensional metasurface sensor designed to detect, locate and distinguish between different objects placed in its near field. When an object is placed on the metasurface, local changes can be detected in one or more of the structure\u2019s meta-atoms. This interaction generally modifies the inductance of the meta-atom, resulting in changes to the overall input impedance of the surface. We derive the properties of the structure and its behaviour in terms of superposition and demonstrate that observing the meta-surface from a single point is sufficient for unambiguous localisation and identification. To model these changes effectively and identify the position of an object, we employ a neural network machine learning algorithm. Our approach enables accurate localisation of all studied objects, with a precision exceeding \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$98\\%$$\\end{document}98%. Additionally, the distinct signatures of the objects allow for separation between them with an accuracy of over \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$97\\%$$\\end{document}97%. The potential applications of this platform extend to foreign object detection on metasurfaces for wireless power transfer, providing proximity detection for many surfaces such as clothing, car bodies and robotic carapaces. Furthermore, our research suggests the feasibility of implementing a touchscreen type interface requiring only a single waveguide connection.",

        "abstract": "This piece explores technologies for freer communication with machines, i.e. bots (chatbots or conversational agents), rather than the concept of speaking to machines, such as Intelligent Assistants (IA) like Alexa. Bots are computer programmes which simulate natural intelligent communication using text or speech technologies. The first chatbot claimed to pass the Turing Test (a test to identify whether a computer is intelligent), ELIZA, was created by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966 to imitate a psychotherapist. More recently, interest in chatbots appears to have shifted from whether they can be perceived as human to their ability to imitate natural conversations to achieve specific purposes and provide efficient customer services.",

        "abstract": "Agrochemical residues, including pesticides and herbicides, pose significant environmental and health risks when present in water sources. Conventional water treatment methods often fall short in effectively removing these persistent pollutants, necessitating innovative solutions. This review explores the use of polysaccharides and composite adsorbents as sustainable alternatives for agrochemical residue removal from water. Biopolymers such as chitosan, alginate, and cellulose are highlighted for their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and ability to be functionalized for enhanced adsorption performance. Recent advances in the development of composite materials incorporating nanomaterials, such as graphene, oxide, and metal oxides, have shown significant promise in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of agrochemical adsorption. The review also addresses the fundamental mechanism of adsorption, such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic forces, that contribute to the effectiveness of these materials. Challenges associated with scalability, regeneration, and real-world applications are discussed, as well as future opportunities for integrating emerging technologies like 3D printing and machine learning into adsorbent design. Overall, polysaccharides and composites offer a promising pathway toward achieving efficient and sustainable agrochemical residue removal, with ongoing research needed to overcome current limitations and optimize their practical application in water treatment.",

        "title": "Estimating Flyrock Distance Induced Due to Mine Blasting by Extreme Learning Machine Coupled with an Equilibrium Optimizer",
        "abstract": "Blasting is essential for breaking hard rock in opencast mines and tunneling projects. It creates an adverse impact on flyrock. Thus, it is essential to forecast flyrock to minimize the environmental effects. The objective of this study is to forecast/estimate the amount of flyrock produced during blasting by applying three creative composite intelligent models: equilibrium optimizer-coupled extreme learning machine (EO-ELM), particle swarm optimization-based extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). To obtain a successful conclusion, we considered 114 blasting data parameters consisting of eight inputs (hole diameter, burden, stemming length, rock density, charge-per-meter, powder factor (PF), blastability index (BI), and weathering index), and one output parameter (flyrock distance). We then compared the results of different models using seven different performance indices. Every predictive model accomplished the results comparable with the measured values of flyrock. To show the effectiveness of the developed EO-ELM, the result from each model run 10-times is compared. The average result shows that the EO-ELM model in testing (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 32.14, MAE = 19.78, MAPE = 20.37, NSE = 0.93, VAF = 93.97, A20 = 0.57) achieved a better performance as compared to the PSO-ANN model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 64.44, MAE = 36.02, MAPE = 29.96, NSE = 0.72, VAF = 74.72, A20 = 0.33) and PSO-ELM model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 48.55, MAE = 26.97, MAPE = 26.71, NSE = 0.84, VAF = 84.84, A20 = 0.51). Further, a non-parametric test is performed to assess the performance of these three models developed. It shows that the EO-ELM performed better in the prediction of flyrock compared to PSO-ELM and PSO-ANN. We did sensitivity analysis by introducing a new parameter, WI. Input parameters, PF and BI, showed the highest sensitivity with 0.98 each.",

        "title": "Maintaining proper health records improves machine learning predictions for novel 2019-nCoV",
        "abstract": "Background An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia continues to affect the whole world including major countries such as China, USA, Italy, France and the United Kingdom. We present outcome (\u2018recovered\u2019, \u2018isolated\u2019 or \u2018death\u2019) risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over \u2018early\u2019 datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used \u2018country\u2019, \u2018age\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019 as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient\u2019s \u2018disease\u2019 history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results The use of a patient\u2019s \u2018disease\u2019 history improves the prediction of \u2018death\u2019 by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent\u2019s \u2018disease\u2019 history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient\u2019s \u2018disease\u2019 history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries.",

        "abstract": "The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the most significant mode of the atmosphere in the North Atlantic, and it plays an important role in regulating the local weather and climate and even those of the entire Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, it is vital to predict NAO events. Since the NAO event can be quantified by the NAO index, an effective neural network model EEMD-ConvLSTM, which is based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), is proposed for NAO index prediction in this paper. EEMD is applied to preprocess NAO index data, which are issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NAO index data are decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). After being filtered by the energy threshold, the remaining IMFs are used to reconstruct new NAO index data as the input of ConvLSTM. In order to evaluate the performance of EEMD-ConvLSTM, six methods were selected as the benchmark, which included traditional models, machine learning algorithms, and other deep neural networks. Furthermore, we forecast the NAO index with EEMD-ConvLSTM and the Rolling Forecast (RF) and compared the results with those of Global Forecast System (GFS) and the averaging of 11 Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model ensemble members (ENSM) provided by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. The experimental results show that EEMD-ConvLSTM not only has the highest reliability from evaluation metrics, but also can better capture the variation trend of the NAO index data.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic data are usually composed of some categorical variables used to represent discrete entities in many real-world applications. Mining of symbolic data is more difficult than numerical data due to the lack of inherent geometric properties of this type of data. In this paper, we use two kinds of kernel learning methods to create a kernel estimation model and a nonlinear classification algorithm for symbolic data. By using the kernel smoothing method, we construct a squared-error consistent probability estimator for symbolic data, followed by a new data transformation model proposed to embed symbolic data into Euclidean space. Based on the model, the inner product and distance measure between symbolic data objects are reformulated, allowing a new Support Vector Machine (SVM), called SVM-S, to be defined for nonlinear classification on symbolic data using the Mercer kernel learning method. The experiment results show that SVM can be much more effective for symbolic data classification based on our proposed model and measures.",

        "abstract": "Phishing, a well-known cyber-attack practice has gained significant research attention in the cyber-security domain for the last two decades due to its dynamic attacking strategies. Although different solutions have been exercised against phishing, phishing attacks have dramatically increased in the past few years. Recent studies have shown that machine learning has become prominent in the present anti-phishing context, and the techniques like deep learning have extensively improved anti-phishing tools\u2019 detection ability. This paper proposes PhishDet, a new way of detecting phishing websites through Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network and Graph Convolutional Network using URL and HTML features. PhishDet is the first of its kind, which uses the powerful analysis and processing capabilities of Graph Neural Network in the anti-phishing domain and recorded 96.42% detection accuracy, with a 0.036 false-negative rate. It is effective against zero-day attacks, and the average detection time which is 1.8 seconds could also be considered realistic. The feature selection of PhishDet is automatic and occurs inside the system, as PhishDet gradually learns URLs and HTML content features to handle constantly changing phishing attacks. This has outperformed similar solutions by achieving a 99.53% f1-score with a public benchmark dataset. However, PhishDet requires periodic retraining to maintain its performance over time. If such retraining could be facilitated, PhishDet could fight against phishers for a more extended period to safeguard Internet users from this Internet threat.",

        "title": "Facial Emotion Recognition Using Conventional Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods: Current Achievements, Analysis and Remaining Challenges",
        "abstract": "Facial emotion recognition (FER) is an emerging and significant research area in the pattern recognition domain. In daily life, the role of non-verbal communication is significant, and in overall communication, its involvement is around 55% to 93%. Facial emotion analysis is efficiently used in surveillance videos, expression analysis, gesture recognition, smart homes, computer games, depression treatment, patient monitoring, anxiety, detecting lies, psychoanalysis, paralinguistic communication, detecting operator fatigue and robotics. In this paper, we present a detailed review on FER. The literature is collected from different reputable research published during the current decade. This review is based on conventional machine learning (ML) and various deep learning (DL) approaches. Further, different FER datasets for evaluation metrics that are publicly available are discussed and compared with benchmark results. This paper provides a holistic review of FER using traditional ML and DL methods to highlight the future gap in this domain for new researchers. Finally, this review work is a guidebook and very helpful for young researchers in the FER area, providing a general understating and basic knowledge of the current state-of-the-art methods, and to experienced researchers looking for productive directions for future work.",

        "title": "Towards the ultimate differential SMEFT analysis",
        "abstract": "We obtain SMEFT bounds using an approach that utilises the complete multi-dimensional differential information of a process. This approach is based on the fact that at a given EFT order, the full angular distribution in the most important electroweak processes can be expressed as a sum of a fixed number of basis functions. The coefficients of these basis functions \u2014 the so-called angular moments \u2014 and their energy dependance, thus form an ideal set of experimental observables that encapsulates the complete multi-dimensional differential information of the process. This approach is generic and the observables constructed allow to avoid blind directions in the SMEFT parameter space. While this method is applicable to many of the important electroweak processes, as a first example we study the pp \u2192 V(\u2113\u2113)h(bb) process (V \u2261 Z/W\u00b1, \u2113\u2113 \u2261 \u2113+\u2113\u2212/\u2113\u00b1\u03bd), including QCD NLO effects, differentially. We show that using the full differential data in this way plays a crucial role in simultaneously and maximally constraining the different vertex structures of the Higgs coupling to gauge bosons. In particular, our method yields bounds on the hV\u03bc\u03bdV\u03bc\u03bd,hV\u03bc\u03bdV\u02dc\u03bc\u03bd\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ {hV}_{\\mu \\nu}{V}^{\\mu \\nu},{hV}_{\\mu \\nu}{\\tilde{V}}^{\\mu \\nu} $$\\end{document} and hVffff\u2261ff\u00af/ff\u00af\u2032\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ hVff\\left( ff\\equiv f\\overline{f}/f\\overline{f}^{\\prime}\\right) $$\\end{document} couplings, stronger than projected bounds reported in any other process. This matrix-element-based method can provide a transparent alternative to complement machine learning techniques that also aim to disentangle correlations in the SMEFT parameter space.",

        "abstract": "The glass relics are precious material evidence of the early trade and cultural exchange between the East and the West. To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit. In comparison with other similar types of models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF), the classification accuracy of JMLA is 97.9% on the train set. The accuracy rate on the test set reached 97.6%. The results of the research demonstrate that JMLA can improve the accuracy of the glass type classification problem, greatly enhance the research efficiency of archaeological staff, and gain a more reliable result.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing has revolutionized the modes of computing. With huge success and diverse benefits, the paradigm faces several challenges as well. Power consumption, dynamic resource scaling, and over- and under-provisioning issues are challenges for the cloud computing paradigm. The research has been carried out in cloud computing for resource utilization prediction to overcome over- and under-provisioning issues. Over-provisioning of resources consumes more energy and leads to high costs. However, under-provisioning induces Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and Quality of Service (QoS) degradation. Most of the existing mechanisms focus on single resource utilization prediction, such as memory, CPU, storage, network, or servers allocated to cloud applications but overlook the correlation among resources. This research focuses on multi-resource utilization prediction using Functional Link Neural Network (FLNN) with hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed technique is evaluated on Google cluster traces data. Experimental results show that the proposed model yields better accuracy as compared to traditional techniques.",

The research paper examines: the grounds for qualifying such processing as copyright infringement and certain obstacles to the full protection of copyright (including Big Data, being a subject of processing by AI systems). The paper proposes the adoption of certain public law principles of copyright objects processing by artificial intelligent systems, in particular: the principle of limited purpose, according to which the processing of works should be carried out exclusively for the purposes established by the operator of the artificial intellectual system; the principle of limited storage, which involves storing personal data (in a form accessible to identify the subjects of this data) no longer than required in-order to achieve the stated processing purposes; the principle of transparent reporting \u2014 reporting on the quantity and quality of processed data sets, accessible to any person, regardless of interest.",

        "title": "Machine learning based canine posture estimation using inertial data",
        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to design a new canine posture estimation system specifically for working dogs. The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs\u2019 chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed. The dataset and code used are publicly available on Mendeley Data and GitHub, respectively.",

        "abstract": "\n With the emerging developments in millimeter-wave/5G technologies, the potential for wireless Internet of things devices to achieve widespread sensing, precise localization, and high data-rate communication systems becomes increasingly viable. The surge in interest surrounding virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies is attributed to the vast array of applications they enable, ranging from surgical training to motion capture and daily interactions in VR spaces. To further elevate the user experience, and real-time and accurate orientation detection of the user, the authors proposes the utilization of a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system coupled with an ultra-low-power, sticker-like millimeter-wave identification (mmID). The mmID features four backscattering elements, multiplexed in amplitude, frequency, and spatial domains. This design utilizes the training of a supervised learning classification convolutional neural network, enabling accurate real-time three-axis orientation detection of the user. The proposed orientation detection system exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 90.58% over three axes at a distance of 8 m. This high accuracy underscores the precision of the orientation detection system, particularly tailored for medium-range VR/AR applications. The integration of the FMCW-based mmID system with machine learning proves to be a promising advancement, contributing to the seamless and immersive interaction within virtual and augmented environments.",

Researchers exploit this information to predict user preferences, model the item's attributes, and offer intelligible recommendations. However, not all contextual ratings are significant because they may be posted by various users for various reasons and based on different routines. Further, as users care about different attributes of multiple contexts, not all user ratings equally reflect the users' opinion of the overall rating, a primary concern in recommender systems. This article predicts the overall rating using user-user and item collaborative filtering with significant contexts and the outcome tested on various machine and deep learning models using the contextual segments.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform surgery in Pakistan, improving results, reducing complications, and increasing patient safety. Deep learning, a branch of machine learning, can assist surgeons in making wise judgments. Pubmed and Research Gate discuss the promise of AI in surgery. Incorporating AI in healthcare systems can expedite diagnosis and management while avoiding injudicious resource allocation.\nAI-based techniques in cardiology, nephrology, and neurology enable high-accuracy detection of cardiovascular disease risks, kidney disease treatment, and epileptic episode identification. Neurological devices like bispectral index monitor (BIS) and Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) utilize advanced technology for reliable monitoring and objective diagnosis of neurological issues (Ahmed, 2022). AI uses electronic data and neural network methods to evaluate operating room logistics, time management, and anesthesiologist activities using electronic data and neural network methods (Khan F. H., 2019). AI algorithms are effectively detect minute differences for accurate diagnosis, with studies showing high specificity, sensitivity, and inter-operator repeatability. AI can be used to train and assess neurosurgical residents and early mid-career surgeons, improving diagnosis and 3D simulation labs (Shlobin, 2022). Surgeons play a crucial role in adopting AI-based technologies for surgical care by partnering with data scientists to capture novel clinical data and generate meaningful interpretations. They should demand transparency and interpretability in algorithms to hold AI accountable for its predictions and recommendations.AI advancements in plastic surgery practice, research, and education offer opportunities for improvement. Combining AI-enabled decision-making tools with predictive analytics and human intuition, surgeons can make real-time decisions based on 3D planning, anatomical localization, and navigation (Rasteau, 2022). While current AI tools cannot perform complex surgical procedures, advancements may enable them to perform more complex tasks in the future.\nPakistan is a significant market for AI-based solutions, utilizing technology in various industries to address challenges and boost demand. The country has enhanced its self-security systems, including AI-powered missiles, cyber security, and effective cameras (Khan, 2022). AI allows tasks to be completed more precisely and efficiently, with machine learning and deep learning being advanced subtypes. In developing countries like Pakistan, AI tools are needed for patient-centred diagnosis and treatment assistance, especially in emergency surgery such as cardiac illnesses or life threatening bleeding caused road traffic accident. Hence insuring patient receive care timely. An appropriate budget should be allocated for AI technologies in the health sector.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Accurately estimating body weight is crucial for managing water buffalo health and optimizing feeding strategies. This study explored the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting body weight based on body measurements. Principal component analysis was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most relevant features. Subsequently, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms were utilized to predict body weight using the reduced data set. The Gradient Boosting algorithm demonstrated superior performance compared to the Random Forest algorithm. These findings suggest that the combination of principal component analysis and Gradient Boosting offers a reliable and effective method for estimating body weight in water buffaloes. This approach holds promise for improving animal production and health management practices. Future research could focus on enhancing the applicability and generalizability of these models to diverse water buffalo populations across various geographical regions. Abstract This study aims to use advanced machine learning techniques supported by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate body weight (BW) in buffalos raised in southeastern Mexico and compare their performance. The first stage of the current study consists of body measurements and the process of determining the most informative variables using PCA, a dimension reduction method. This process reduces the data size by eliminating the complex structure of the model and provides a faster and more effective learning process. As a second stage, two separate prediction models were developed with Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms, using the principal components obtained from the data set reduced by PCA. The performances of both models were compared using R2, RMSE and MAE metrics, and showed that the Gradient Boosting model achieved a better prediction performance with a higher R2 value and lower error rates than the Random Forest model. In conclusion, PCA-supported modeling applications can provide more reliable results, and the Gradient Boosting algorithm is superior to Random Forest in this context. The current study demonstrates the potential use of machine learning approaches in estimating body weight in water buffalos, and will support sustainable animal husbandry by contributing to decision making processes in the field of animal science.",

        "title": "Predicting pain among female survivors of recent interpersonal violence: A proof-of-concept machine-learning approach",
        "abstract": "Interpersonal violence (IPV) is highly prevalent in the United States and is a major public health problem. The emergence and/or worsening of chronic pain are known sequelae of IPV; however, not all those who experience IPV develop chronic pain. To mitigate its development, it is critical to identify the factors that are associated with increased risk of pain after IPV. This proof-of-concept study used machine-learning strategies to predict pain severity and interference in 47 young women, ages 18 to 30, who experienced an incident of IPV (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) within three months of their baseline assessment. Young women are more likely than men to experience IPV and to subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Women completed a comprehensive assessment of theory-driven cognitive and neurobiological predictors of pain severity and pain-related interference (e.g., pain, coping, disability, psychiatric diagnosis/symptoms, PTSD/trauma, executive function, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress response). Gradient boosting machine models were used to predict symptoms of pain severity and pain-related interference across time (Baseline, 1-,3-,6- follow-up assessments). Models showed excellent predictive performance for pain severity and adequate predictive performance for pain-related interference. This proof-of-concept study suggests that machine-learning approaches are a useful tool for identifying predictors of pain development in survivors of recent IPV. Baseline measures of pain, family life impairment, neuropsychological function, and trauma history were of greatest importance in predicting pain and pain-related interference across a 6-month follow-up period. Present findings support the use of machine-learning techniques in larger studies of post-IPV pain development and highlight theory-driven predictors that could inform the development of targeted early intervention programs. However, these results should be replicated in a larger dataset with lower levels of missing data.",

        "abstract": "Key Points Question Did decreases in exposure to spoken communication, found in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic among children using cochlear implants, resolve as lockdowns became more intermittent in later pandemic stages? Findings In this cohort study, sound environments cataloged using machine learning for cochlear implants were measured by 2746 datalogs for 262 children using cochlear implants before and during 2 years of COVID-19 lockdowns in Ontario, Canada. Due to school closures during lockdowns, school-aged children experienced significantly decreased exposure to spoken language, which has not recovered to the prepandemic baseline. Meaning This study suggests that school closures due to COVID-19 lockdowns are associated with reduced exposure to spoken communications among children using cochlear implants during sensitive periods of development.",

        "abstract": "Bovine subclinical mastitis (SCM) is the costliest disease for the dairy industry. Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14\u2009months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000\u2009cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Intravesical onabotulinumA injection is actively used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume. The findings contribute to our understanding of onabotulinumA injection treatment for OAB and support evidence-based decision-making using readily available information.",

        "title": "IDRMutPred: predicting disease-associated germline nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) in intrinsically disordered regions",
        "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Despite of the lack of folded structure, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins play versatile roles in various biological processes, and many nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) in IDRs are associated with human diseases. The continuous accumulation of nsSNVs resulted from the wide application of NGS has driven the development of disease-association prediction methods for decades. However, their performance on nsSNVs in IDRs remains inferior, possibly due to the domination of nsSNVs from structured regions in training data. Therefore, it is highly demanding to build a disease-association predictor specifically for nsSNVs in IDRs with better performance. Results We present IDRMutPred, a machine learning-based tool specifically for predicting disease-associated germline nsSNVs in IDRs. Based on 17 selected optimal features that are extracted from sequence alignments, protein annotations, hydrophobicity indices and disorder scores, IDRMutPred was trained using three ensemble learning algorithms on the training dataset containing only IDR nsSNVs. The evaluation on the two testing datasets shows that all the three prediction models outperform 17 other popular general predictors significantly, achieving the ACC between 0.856 and 0.868 and MCC between 0.713 and 0.737. IDRMutPred will prioritize disease-associated IDR germline nsSNVs more reliably than general predictors.

        "abstract": "As machine learning becomes more widely used, the need to study its implications in security and privacy becomes more urgent. Although the body of work in privacy has been steadily growing over the past few years, research on the privacy aspects of machine learning has received less focus than the security aspects. Our contribution in this research is an analysis of more than 45 papers related to privacy attacks against machine learning that have been published during the past seven years. We propose an attack taxonomy, together with a threat model that allows the categorization of different attacks based on the adversarial knowledge, and the assets under attack. An initial exploration of the causes of privacy leaks is presented, as well as a detailed analysis of the different attacks. Finally, we present an overview of the most commonly proposed defenses and a discussion of the open problems and future directions identified during our analysis.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe our approach for Named Entity Recognition in Twitter, a shared task for ACL 2015 Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (Baldwin et al., 2015). Because of the noisy, short, and colloquial nature of Twitter, the performance of Named Entity Recognition (NER) degrades significantly. To address this problem, we propose a novel method to enhance the performance of the Twitter NER task by using Entity Linking which is a method for detecting entity mentions in text and resolving them to corresponding entries in knowledge bases such as Wikipedia. Our method is based on supervised machine-learning and uses the highquality knowledge obtained from several open knowledge bases. In comparison with the other systems proposed for this shared task, our method achieved the best performance.",

        "abstract": "The human gut microbiome has received a crescendo of attention in recent years, due to the countless influences on human pathophysiology, including cancer. Research on cancer and anticancer therapy is constantly looking for new hints to improve the response to therapy while reducing the risk of relapse. In this scenario, the gut microbiome and the plethora of microbial-derived metabolites are considered a new opening in the development of innovative anticancer treatments for a better prognosis. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiome in the onset and progression of cancer, as well as in response to chemo-immunotherapy. Recent findings regarding the tumor microbiome and its implications for clinical practice are also commented on. Current microbiome-based intervention strategies (i.e., prebiotics, probiotics, live biotherapeutics and fecal microbiota transplantation) are then discussed, along with key shortcomings, including a lack of long-term safety information in patients who are already severely compromised by standard treatments. The implementation of bioinformatic tools applied to microbiomics and other omics data, such as machine learning, has an enormous potential to push research in the field, enabling the prediction of health risk and therapeutic outcomes, for a truly personalized precision medicine.",

        "abstract": "Human activity understanding includes activity recognition and activity pattern discovery. Monitoring human activity and finding abnormality in their activities used by many field like medical applications, security systems etc. Basically it helps and support in decision making systems. Mining user activity from web logs can helps in finding hidden information about the user access pattern which reveals the web access behaviour of the users. Clustering and Classification techniques are used for web user identification. Clustering is the task of grouping similar patterns for web user identification. Classification is the process of classifying web patterns for user identification. In this paper we have implemented the existing works and discussed the results here to find the limitations. In existing methods, many data mining techniques were introduced for web user behaviour identification. But, the user identification accuracy was not improved and time consumption was not reduced. Our objective is to study the existing work and explore the possibility to improve the identification accuracy and reduce the time consumption using machine learning and deep learning techniques",

        "abstract": "Modeling the effect of mutations on protein thermodynamics stability is useful for protein engineering and understanding molecular mechanisms of disease-causing variants. Here, we report a new development of the SAAFEC method, the SAAFEC-SEQ, which is a gradient boosting decision tree machine learning method to predict the change of the folding free energy caused by amino acid substitutions. The method does not require the 3D structure of the corresponding protein, but only its sequence and, thus, can be applied on genome-scale investigations where structural information is very sparse. SAAFEC-SEQ uses physicochemical properties, sequence features, and evolutionary information features to make the predictions. It is shown to consistently outperform all existing state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and root-mean-squared-error parameters as benchmarked on several independent datasets. The SAAFEC-SEQ has been implemented into a web server and is available as stand-alone code that can be downloaded and embedded into other researchers\u2019 code.",

We used a dataset containing 5,000 movie reviews in which 2,500 were marked as positive and 2,500 as negative. We chose 5,189 words which have an influence on sentence sentiment. The dataset was prepared using a term document matrix (TDM) and classical multidimensional scaling (MDS). This is the first time that TDM and MDS have been used to choose the characteristics of text in sentiment analysis. In this case, we decided to examine different indicators of the specific classifier, such as kernel type for SVM and neighbour count in kNN. All calculations were performed in the R language, in the program R Studio v 3.5.2. Our work can be reproduced because all of our data sets and source code are public.",

Although formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are deemed crucial for research and clinical applications, the fixation process results in molecular damage to nucleic acids, thus confounding their use in genome sequence analysis. Methods to improve genomic data quality from FFPE tissues have emerged, but there remains significant room for improvement. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from matched Fresh Frozen (FF) and FFPE tissue samples to optimize a sensitive and precise FFPE single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling approach. We present methods to reduce the prevalence of false-positive SNVs by applying combinatorial techniques to five publicly available variant callers. We also introduce FFPolish, a novel variant classification method that efficiently classifies FFPE-specific false-positive variants. Our combinatorial and statistical techniques improve precision and F1 scores compared to the results of publicly available tools when tested individually.",

        "abstract": "According to the National Cancer Institute, there were 9.5 million cancer-related deaths in 2018. A challenge in improving treatment is resistance in genetically unstable cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate unsupervised machine learning on classifying treatment-resistant phenotypes in heterogeneous tumors through analysis of single cell RNA sequencing(scRNAseq) data with a pipeline and evaluation metrics. scRNAseq quantifies mRNA in cells and characterizes cell phenotypes. One scRNAseq dataset was analyzed (tumor/non-tumor cells of different molecular subtypes and patient identifications). The pipeline consisted of data filtering, dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis, projection with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, clustering with nine approaches (Ward, BIRCH, Gaussian Mixture Model, DBSCAN, Spectral, Affinity Propagation, Agglomerative Clustering, Mean Shift, and K-Means), and evaluation. Seven models divided tumor versus non-tumor cells and molecular subtype while six models classified different patient identification (13 of which were presented in the dataset); K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH often ranked highest with ~80% accuracy on the tumor versus non-tumor task and ~60% for molecular subtype and patient ID. An optimized classification pipeline using K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH models was evaluated to be most effective for further analysis. In clinical research where there is currently no standard protocol for scRNAseq analysis, clusters generated from this pipeline can be used to understand cancer cell behavior and malignant growth, directly affecting the success of treatment.",

        "title": "A summary-statistics-based approach to examine the role of serotonin transporter promoter tandem repeat polymorphism in psychiatric phenotypes",
        "abstract": "In genetic studies of psychiatric disorders in the pre-genome-wide association study (GWAS) era, one of the most commonly studied loci is the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) promoter polymorphism, a 43-base-pair insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The genetic association signals between 5-HTTLPR and psychiatric phenotypes, however, have been inconsistent across many studies. Since the polymorphism cannot be tested via available SNP arrays, we had previously proposed an efficient machine learning algorithm to predict the genotypes of 5-HTTLPR based on the genotypes of eight nearby SNPs, which requires access to individual-level genotype and phenotype data. To utilize the advantage of publicly available GWAS summary statistics obtained from studies with very large sample sizes, we develop a GWAS summary-statistics-based approach for testing the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) associations with various phenotypes. We first cross-verify the accuracy of the summary-statistics-based approach for 61 phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Since we observed a strong similarity between the predicted individual-level 5-HTTLPR genotype-based approach and the summary-statistics-based approach, we applied our method to the available neurobehavioral GWAS summary statistics data obtained from large-scale GWAS. We found no genome-wide significant evidence for association between 5-HTTLPR and any of the neurobehavioral traits. We did observe, however, genome-wide significant evidence for association between this locus and human adult height, BMI, and total cholesterol. Our summary-statistics-based approach provides a systematic way to examine the role of VNTRs and related types of genetic polymorphisms in disease risk and trait susceptibility of phenotypes for which large-scale GWAS summary statistics data are available.",

        "abstract": "We provide a sequence of analysis-ready optical underwater images from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) of the Pacific Ocean. The images were originally recorded using a towed camera sledge that photographed a seabed covered with polymetallic manganese-nodules, at an average water depth of 4,250 meters. The original degradation in visual quality and inconsistent scale among individual raw images due to different altitude implies that they are not scientifically comparable in their original form. Here, we present analysis-ready images that have already been pre-processed to account for this degradation. We also provide accompanying metadata for each image, which includes their geographic coordinates, depth\u00a0of the seafloor, absolute scale (cm/pixel), and seafloor habitat class obtained from a previous study. The provided images are thus directly usable by the marine scientific community e.g., to train machine learning models for seafloor substrate classification and megafauna detection.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms present substantial promise for more effective decision\u2010making by administrative agencies. However, some of these algorithms are inscrutable, namely, they produce predictions that humans cannot understand or explain. This trait is in tension with the emphasis on reason\u2010giving in administrative law. The article explores this tension, advancing two interrelated arguments. First, providing adequate reasons is a significant facet of respecting individuals\u2019 agency. Incorporating inscrutable algorithmic predictions into administrative decision\u2010making compromises this normative ideal. Second, as a long\u2010term concern, the use of inscrutable algorithms by administrative agencies may generate systemic effects by gradually reducing the realm of the humanly explainable in public life, a phenomenon Max Weber termed \u2018re\u2010enchantment\u2019. As a result, the use of inscrutable machine learning algorithms might trigger a special kind of re\u2010enchantment, making us comprehend less rather than more of shared human experience, and consequently altering the way we understand the administrative state and experience public life.",

        "title": "Jucazinho Dam Streamflow Prediction: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques",
        "abstract": "The centuries-old history of dam construction, from the Saad el-Kafara Dam to global expansion in the 1950s, highlights the importance of these structures in water resource management. The Jucazinho Dam, built in 1998, emerged as a response to the scarcity of water in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil. After having less than 1% of its water storage capacity in 2016, the dam recovered in 2020 after interventions by the local water utility. In this context, the reliability of influent flow prediction models for dams becomes crucial for managers. This study proposed hydrological models based on artificial intelligence that aim to generate flow series, and we evaluated the adaptability of these models for the operation of the Jucazinho Dam. Data normalization between 0 and 1 was applied to avoid the predominance of variables with high values. The model was based on machine learning and employed support vector regression (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), as provided by the Python Sklearn library. The selection of the monitoring stations took place via the Brazilian National Water and Sanitation Agency\u2019s (ANA) HIDROWEB portal, and we used Spearman\u2019s correlation to identify the relationship between precipitation and flow. The evaluation of the performance of the model involved graphical analyses and statistical criteria such as the Nash\u2013Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the percentage of bias (PBIAS), the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean standard deviation ratio (RSR). The results of the statistical coefficients for the test data indicated unsatisfactory performance for long-term predictions (8, 16 and 32 days ahead), revealing a downward trend in the quality of the fit with an increase in the forecast horizon. The SVM model stood out by obtaining the best indices of NSE, PBIAS, R2 and RSR. The graphical results of the SVM models showed underestimation of the flow values with an increase in the forecast horizon due to the sensitivity of the SVM to complex patterns in the time series. On the other hand, the RF and ANN models showed hyperestimation of the flow values as the number of forecast days increased, which was mainly attributed to overfitting. In summary, this study highlights the relevance of artificial intelligence in flow prediction for the efficient management of dams, especially in water scarcity and data-scarce scenarios. A proper choice of models and the ensuring of reliable input data are crucial for obtaining accurate forecasts and can contribute to water security and the effective operation of dams such as Jucazinho.",

        "abstract": "Resume analysis is the process in which a machine analyses a resume based on given requirements of the job description. With the flood of resumes received by companies, it is not effective and also not possible for a person to go through a number of resumes to select a candidate. They have become very popular among the companies in the process of determining candidate selection. The main objective of the project is to be able to match the requirements and skills from a job description to the resume applied. This gives an instantaneous result on whether the resume is accepted or rejected. The end process allows the company itself to be able to select candidates without the requirement of a third party and thus is also cost effective. A big number of resumes could be used in this project to sort the necessary application using various classifiers. Following classifications, the top n candidates will be sorted in accordance with the job description using content-based recommendation and cosine similarity. The project employs k-NN to determine which CVs are most similar to the supplied job description. Through machine learning, the system evaluates a resume for a particular position using NLP.",

While the field is innovative, the access to cutting-edge technology is limited with reference to the global population. A significant way to improve overall healthcare is to understand the needs and possibilities of all possible consumers when developing sophisticated and accurate medical devices. The Smartphone-based Keratograph (SBK), is an example of a new project that uses real world feedback, addresses an unmet medical need, and implements commercially available components to create a device that is affordable, portable and simplistic to operate. The long-term goal of the SBK is to collect data from users for supervised machine-learning. This machine-learning aspect will ultimately aid in the development of an artificial intelligence device to enable even earlier detection of keratoconus, especially in children and adolescents. Again, the ultimate goal of any medical device should be to improve patient care, and to make a significant improvement on vision healthcare for the global population, providing access to this technology is essential.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the mechanical properties of cement-based mortars is essential in understanding the life and functioning of structures. Machine learning (ML) algorithms in this regard can be especially useful in prediction scenarios. In this paper, a comprehensive comparison of nine ML algorithms, i.e., linear regression (LR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), AdaBoost regression (ABR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting regression (GBR), decision tree regression (DT), hist gradient boosting regression (hGBR) and XGBoost regression (XGB), is carried out. A multi-attribute decision making method called TOPSIS (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution) is used to select the best ML metamodel. A large dataset on cement-based mortars consisting of 424 sample points is used. The compressive strength of cement-based mortars is predicted based on six input parameters, i.e., the age of specimen (AS), the cement grade (CG), the metakaolin-to-total-binder ratio (MK/B), the water-to-binder ratio (W/B), the superplasticizer-to-binder ratio (SP) and the binder-to-sand ratio (B/S). XGBoost regression is found to be the best ML metamodel while simple metamodels like linear regression (LR) are found to be insufficient in handling the non-linearity in the process. This mapping of the compressive strength of mortars using ML techniques will be helpful for practitioners and researchers in identifying suitable mortar mixes.",

        "abstract": "A scoring function that can reliably assess the accuracy of a 3D RNA structural model in the absence of experimental structure is not only important for model evaluation and selection but also useful for scoring-guided conformational sampling. However, high-fidelity RNA scoring has proven to be difficult using conventional knowledge-based statistical potentials and currently-available machine learning-based approaches. Here we present lociPARSE, a locality-aware invariant point attention architecture for scoring RNA 3D structures. Unlike existing machine learning methods that estimate superposition-based root mean square deviation (RMSD), lociPARSE estimates Local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) scores capturing the accuracy of each nucleotide and its surrounding local atomic environment in a superposition-free manner, before aggregating information to predict global structural accuracy. Tested on multiple datasets including CASP15, lociPARSE significantly outperforms existing statistical potentials (rsRNASP, cgRNASP, DFIRE-RNA, and RASP) and machine learning methods (ARES and RNA3DCNN) across complementary assessment metrics. lociPARSE is freely available at https://github.com/Bhattacharya-Lab/lociPARSE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Machine learning is a set of algorithms and statistical models that computers use to perform a desired task. Machine learning can be used in many applications such as face detection, speech recognition, medical diagnostics, statistical arbitrage, traffic prediction, etc. The traffic environment includes everything that can affect traffic on the road, whether it is traffic lights, accidents, rallies, or even road repairs that can cause congestion. If we have preconceived information very close to all of the above and the many everyday situations that can affect traffic, the driver or passenger can make an informed decision. It also helps with the future of automotive vehicles. In the present decades, traffic data has been massively generated, and we have moved towards big data concepts for transportation. The to be had site visitors glide forecasting strategies use a few site visitors\u2019 prediction fashions and are nonetheless unsatisfactory to address real-global applications. It is lumbering to figure out the traffic flow precisely since the information accessible for the transportation framework is madly colossal. In this work, we arranged to utilize machine learning, genetic, soft computing, and deep learning algorithms to analyse the big-data for the transportation system with much-reduced complexity. Moreover, Image Processing algorithms are included in traffic sign recognition, which inevitably helps for the right training of autonomous vehicles. In economic years, Mobility GPS has become very popular in big cities in determining traffic percentage with the help of centralized traffic - server management. The data collected can be used to build an idea that displays the current traffic in the city and can be used in the future in predicting traffic and congestion analysis can be done",

        "abstract": "In traditional methods, it is critical for an effective continuous pulse monitor for humans prone to heart rate abnormalities. This paper proposes a secured heartrate abnormality detector which continuously monitors human pulse rate and SpO2 level. The current studies proposes that machine learning (ML) models performs well in classification; also, TinyML model shows better performance for data from resource constrained IoT devices. Hence, the research first analyses abnormal heart rate detection and spam data identification using standard ML algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and TinyML. Though ML models are superior in classification, deep learning approaches outperforms them in feature learning. Hence, our proposed framework combines the merits of both ML and DL models. In our approach, the generated healthcare dataset is fed to DL models such as ANN, and autoencoder and also to SHAP XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) for feature extraction and learning. These learnt features are fed to ML models for classification. In this experiment, the proposed ETL-FEXIC (Enhanced Tiny Machine Learning with Automated Feature Extraction) outperforms the other ML models where the extracted features from XAI is fed to optimized TinyML classification model.",

        "abstract": "Modern production has stricter requirements for the reliability of complex systems; thus, it is meaningful to estimate the health of complex systems. A complex system has diverse observation features and complex internal structures, which have been difficult to study with regard to health condition estimation. To describe continuous and gradually changing time-based characteristics of a complex system\u2019s health condition, this study develops a feature selection model based on the information amount and stability. Then, a reliability tree analysis model is designed according to the selected relevant features, the reliability tree is developed using expert knowledge, and the node weight is calculated by the correlation coefficient generated during the feature selection process. Using the simple recurrent unit (SRU), which is a time series machine learning algorithm that achieves a high operating efficiency, the results of the reliability tree analysis are combined to establish a tree-structure SRU (T-SRU) model for complex system health condition estimation. Finally, NASA turbofan engine data are used for verification. Results show that the proposed T-SRU model can more accurately estimate a complex system\u2019s health condition and improve the execution efficiency of the SRU networks by approximately 46%.",

        "title": "Measuring Caloric Intake at the Population Level (NOTION): Protocol for an Experimental Study",
        "abstract": "Background The monitoring of caloric intake is an important challenge for the maintenance of individual and public health. The instruments used so far for dietary monitoring (eg, food frequency questionnaires, food diaries, and telephone interviews) are inexpensive and easy to implement but show important inaccuracies. Alternative methods based on wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated from these types of devices. Objective This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable estimate of caloric intake. Methods The study will capture four individual eating activities outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email, flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the University of Padova. Results The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high accuracy. Conclusions Building an automatic calculation method for caloric intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg, for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different segments of the population.

The biopsy Process is very painful and requires considerable time. So, there is a need for a technique that can detect melanoma cancer that could avoid biopsy and that would be based on looking deep into skin cancer images. This paper has conducted a study on image classification of melanoma skin cancer using machine learning and various neural network techniques. The stages of the cancer image classification process melanoma skin in this study include the preprocessing process, segmentation, feature extraction with ABCD namely Asymmetry, Border Irregularity, Color Variation and Diameter. Subsequently, it's quantified that both the machine learning and neural network can be used for skin cancer diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Cancers of unknown primary (CUPs) represent a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the field of oncology. Due to the limitations of current diagnostic tools in these cases, novel approaches must be brought forward to improve treatment outcomes for these patients. The objective of this study was to develop a machine-learning-based software for primary cancer site prediction (OncoOrigin), based on genetic data acquired from tumor DNA sequencing. By design, this was an in silico diagnostic study, conducted using data from the cBioPortal database (accessed on 21 September 2024) and several data processing and machine learning Python libraries. The study involved over 20,000 tumor samples with information on patient age, sex, and the presence of genetic variants in over 600 genes. The main outcome of interest was machine-learning-based discrimination between cancer site classes. Model quality was assessed by training set cross-validation and evaluation on a segregated test set. Finally, the optimal model was incorporated with a graphical user interface into the OncoOrigin software. Feature importance for class discrimination was also determined on the optimal model. Out of the four tested machine learning estimators, the XGBoostClassifier-based model proved superior in test set evaluation, with a top-2 accuracy of 0.91 and ROC-AUC of 0.97. Unlike other machine learning models published in the literature, OncoOrigin stands out as the only one integrated with a graphical user interface, which is crucial for facilitating its use by oncology specialists in everyday clinical practice, where its application and implementation will have the greatest value in the future.",

        "abstract": "Background Accumulating evidence reveals mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbates intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation. Despite the growing knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction and ulcerative colitis (UC), the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in UC remains to be fully explored. Methods We integrated 1137 UC colon mucosal samples from 12 multicenter cohorts worldwide to create a normalized compendium. Differentially expressed mitochondria-related genes (DE-MiRGs) in individuals with UC were identified using the \u201cLimma\u201d R package. Unsupervised consensus clustering was utilized to determine the intrinsic subtypes of UC driven by DE-MiRGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to investigate module genes related to UC. Four machine learning algorithms were utilized for screening DE-MiRGs in UC and construct MiRGs diagnostic models. The models were developed utilizing the over-sampled training cohort, followed by validation in both the internal test cohort and the external validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Xcell and CIBERSORT algorithms, while potential biological mechanisms were explored through GSVA and GSEA algorithms. Hub genes were selected using the PPI network. Results The study identified 108 DE-MiRGs in the colonic mucosa of patients with UC compared to healthy controls, showing significant enrichment in pathways associated with mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation. The MiRGs diagnostic models for UC were constructed based on 17 signature genes identified through various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities. Utilizing the identified DE-MiRGs from the normalized compendium, 941 patients with UC were stratified into three subtypes characterized by distinct cellular and molecular profiles. Specifically, the metabolic subtype demonstrated enrichment in epithelial cells, the immune-inflamed subtype displayed high enrichment in antigen-presenting cells and pathways related to pro-inflammatory activation, and the transitional subtype exhibited moderate activation across all signaling pathways. Importantly, the immune-inflamed subtype exhibited a stronger correlation with superior response to four biologics: infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and golimumab compared to the metabolic subtype. Conclusion This analysis unveils the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune microenvironment in UC, thereby offering novel perspectives on the potential pathogenesis of UC and precision treatment of UC patients, and identifying new therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "The plastic industry plays a vital role in Thailand, with a significant dependence on plastic materials for a majority of industrial products. Among the various types of plastics, polypropylene (PP) emerges as the most extensively used, making it indispensable for the country's plastic industry. This research focuses on presenting and comparing forecasting models for the price of PP granules in Thailand. The primary objective is to identify the most accurate forecasting model, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) serving as the criterion for assessing the forecast model's performance. Three machine learning forecasting models, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are employed in the study. The findings reveal that the ANN model demonstrates the highest accuracy, achieving a MAPE of 5.89% on the test dataset.",

        "abstract": "As the usage of credit cards has become more common in health care applications of everyday life, banks have found it very\u00a0difficult to detect credit card fraud (CCF) systematically. The fraudulent activities should be identified and detected using new techniques. As a result, machine learning (ML) can help detect CCF in transactions while reducing the strain on financial institutions. This research aims to improve cybersecurity measures by detecting fraudulent transactions in datasets. The new classifier strategies cluster and classifier-based decision tree (CCDT), cluster and classifier-based logistic regression (CCLR), and cluster and classifier-based random forest (CCRF) are modeled in this research. The proposed strategies are applied to detect fraudulent health care activities. This research performed the preprocessing through the feature extraction, sampling, and transformation stages, and the proposed classifiers are simulated, and the results are analyzed. The significant results expected range of the proposed classifiers over the other methods are accuracy\u2014(99.95%, 99.97%), precision\u2014(99.96%, 99.98%), sensitivity\u2014(99.9%, 100%), specificity\u2014(99.8%, 100%). The parameters $$\\mu $$ \u03bc , location, the binary variable, cluster size, and decision tree sampling observations affect the classifiers' performance. CCRF and CCLR obtain the expected significant results than other existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Brain tumors are serious conditions caused by uncontrolled and abnormal cell division. Tumors can have devastating implications if not accurately and promptly detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the methods frequently used to detect brain tumors owing to its excellent resolution. In the past few decades, substantial research has been conducted in the field of classifying brain images, ranging from traditional methods to deep-learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). To accomplish classification, machine-learning methods require manually created features. In contrast, CNN achieves classification by extracting visual features from unprocessed images. The size of the training dataset had a significant impact on the features that CNN extracts. The CNN tends to overfit when its size is small. Deep CNNs (DCNN) with transfer learning have therefore been developed. The aim of this work was to investigate the brain MR image categorization potential of pre-trained DCNN VGG-19, VGG-16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 models using data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Validation of the test set utilizing accuracy, recall, Precision, and F1 score showed that the pre-trained VGG-19 model with transfer learning exhibited the best performance. In addition, these methods offer an end-to-end classification of raw images without the need for manual attribute extraction.",

        "abstract": "The multicollinearity problem is a common phenomenon in data-driven studies, significantly affecting the performance of machine learning algorithms during the process of extracting information from data. Despite its widespread use across various fields, the extreme learning machine (ELM) also suffers from multicollinearity issues. To address this challenge, the ridge and Liu estimators, drawn from statistics literature, have been integrated into ELM theory, resulting in a notable advancement. This study aims to further enhance the capabilities of ridge and Liu estimators within the ELM framework by introducing two innovative two-parameter algorithms (TP1-ELM and TP2-ELM) that simultaneously incorporate both estimators. The proposed algorithms undergo comprehensive benchmarking against ELM, ELM-based algorithms, and other commonly used machine learning techniques across seven diverse datasets. Benchmark results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform both ELM-focused approaches and traditional machine learning algorithms on most datasets, yielding more generalizable and stable results. These findings suggest that the proposed algorithms offer a promising alternative to traditional machine learning techniques for regression and classification tasks, particularly in scenarios where multicollinearity is a concern.",

        "abstract": "Assessment of health and physical function using smartphones (mHealth) has enormous potential due to the ubiquity of smartphones and their potential to provide low cost, scalable access to care as well as frequent, objective measurements, outside of clinical environments. Validation of the algorithms and outcome measures used by mHealth apps is of paramount importance, as poorly validated apps have been found to be harmful to patients. Falls are a complex, common and costly problem in the older adult population. Deficits in balance and postural control are strongly associated with falls risk. Assessment of balance and falls risk using a validated smartphone app may lessen the need for clinical assessments which can be expensive, requiring non-portable equipment and specialist expertise. This study reports results for the real-world deployment of a smartphone app for self-directed, unsupervised assessment of balance and falls risk. The app relies on a previously validated algorithm for assessment of balance and falls risk; the outcome measures employed were trained prior to deployment on an independent data set. Results for a sample of 594 smartphone assessments from 147 unique phones show a strong association between self-reported falls history and the falls risk and balance impairment scores produced by the app, suggesting they may be clinically useful outcome measures. In addition, analysis of the quantitative balance features produced seems to suggest that unsupervised, self-directed assessment of balance in the home is feasible.",

Various techniques have been proposed depends on varieties of learning, including unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised-learning. Some of the experimental results proved that the deep learning systems are performed well compared to conventional machine learning systems in image processing, computer vision and pattern recognition. This paper provides a brief survey, beginning with Deep Neural Network (DNN) in Deep Learning area. The survey moves on-the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and its architectures, such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50 etc. We have included transfer learning by using the CNN\u2019s pre-trained architectures. These architectures are tested with large ImageNet data sets. The deep learning techniques are analyzed with the help of most popular data sets, which are freely available in web. Based on this survey, conclude the performance of the system depends on the GPU system.",

        "title": "A Novel Feature Encoding Scheme for Machine Learning Based Malware Detection Systems",
        "abstract": "Malware detection is an ever-evolving area given that the strides in the detection capabilities being matched by radical attempts to bypass the detection. As the sophistication of malware continues to increase, the demand for innovative approaches to improve detection capabilities become paramount. Machine learning/Deep learning models are being increasingly used for Malware Detection, however one of the most important and frequently overlooked aspects of building such models is feature encoding. This research paper explores the importance of feature encoding to improve the efficiency of threat detection and proposes a novel entropy-based encoding scheme for the categorical features present in the data extracted from malicious inputs. The KDDCUP99, UNSW-NB15 and CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 datasets have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encoding scheme. The results of the proposed encoding scheme are validated against seven other encoding schemes to ascertain the credibility and usability of the proposed scheme. The efficiency of the proposed system evaluated by applying different encoded versions of the datasets to train various machine learning models and determining the classification performance of the models on each dataset. The machine learning models trained with the proposed encoding scheme produced stable classification results and outperformed other encoding schemes when dimensionality reduction was applied on the data. The ensemble classifier trained using the proposed scheme was able to classify the data with an F1 score of 99.99% when the dimension-reduced entropy-encoded KDD Cup99 dataset was used to build the model. On the CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 dataset, the entropy encoding has exhibited a slightly improved classification parameters with the ensemble methods yielding a peak F1 score of 99.27%. We have also determined the feature importance values of the features present in the datasets to study the change in the contribution levels of the features when multiple categorical encoding schemes are applied upon the data.",

        "abstract": "The demand for accurate estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) at high spatial resolution is increasing in grassland-related research and management, especially for those regions with complex topography and fragmented landscapes, where grass and shrub are interspersed. In this study, based on 519 field AGB observations, integrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1) and high-resolution (Sentinel-2) remote sensing images, environmental and topographical data, we estimated the AGB of mountain grassland in Southwest China (Yunnan Province and Guizhou Province) by using remote sensing algorithms ranging from traditional regression to cutting edge machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Four models (i.e., multiple stepwise regression (MSR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN)) were developed and compared for AGB simulation purposes. The results indicated that the RF model performed the best among the four models (testing dataset: decision co-efficient (R2) was 0.80 for shrubland and 0.75 for grassland, respectively). Among all input variables in the RF model, the vegetation indices played the most important role in grassland AGB estimation, with 6 vegetation indices (EVI, EVI2, NDVI, NIRv, MSR and DVI) in the top 10 of input variables. For shrubland, however, topographical factors (elevation, 12.7% IncMSE (increase in mean squared error)) and SAR data (VH band, 11.3% IncMSE) were the variables which contributed the most in the AGB estimation model. By comparing the input variables to the RF model, we found that integrating SAR data has the potential to improve grassland AGB estimation, especially for shrubland (26.7% improvement in the estimation of shrubland AGB). Regional grassland AGB estimation showed a lower mean AGB in Yunnan Province (443.6\u2009g/m2) than that in Guizhou Province (687.6\u2009g/m2) in 2021. Moreover, the correlation between five consecutive years (2018\u20132022) of AGB data and climatic factors calculated by partial correlation analysis showed that regional AGB was positively related with mean annual precipitation in more than 70% of the grassland and 60% of the shrubland area, respectively. Also, we found a positive relationship with mean annual temperature in 62.8% of the grassland and 55.6% of the shrubland area, respectively. This study demonstrated that integrating SAR into grassland AGB estimation led to a remote sensing estimation model that greatly improved the accuracy of modeled mountain grassland AGB in southwest China, where the grassland consists of a complex mix of grass and shrubs.",

        "abstract": "Background The presence of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) alone, regardless of patient condition, is an indication for CT imaging in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Currently, no specific clinical decision rules are available for OAT patients. The aim of the study was to identify which clinical risk factors easily identifiable at first ED evaluation may be associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in OAT patients who suffered an MTBI. Methods Three thousand fifty-four patients in OAT with MTBI from four Italian centers were retrospectively considered. A decision tree analysis using the classification and regression tree (CART) method was conducted to evaluate both the pre- and post-traumatic clinical risk factors most associated with the presence of post-traumatic ICH after MTBI and their possible role in determining the patient\u2019s risk. The decision tree analysis used all clinical risk factors identified at the first ED evaluation as input predictor variables. Results ICH following MTBI was present in 9.5% of patients (290/3054). The CART model created a decision tree using 5 risk factors, post-traumatic amnesia, post-traumatic transitory loss of consciousness, greater trauma dynamic, GCS less than 15, evidence of trauma above the clavicles, capable of stratifying patients into different increasing levels of ICH risk (from 2.5 to 61.4%). The absence of concussion and neurological alteration at admission appears to significantly reduce the possible presence of ICH. Conclusions The machine-learning-based CART model identified distinct prognostic groups of patients with distinct outcomes according to on clinical risk factors. Decision trees can be useful as guidance in patient selection and risk stratification of patients in OAT with MTBI.",

        "abstract": "In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking \u2018big\u2019 by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking \u2018deep\u2019 by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that \u2018business travel\u2019, which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.",

        "abstract": "The long and tiring discussion of who are the best drivers, men or women, is not answered in this article. This article, though, sheds some light on the actual differences that can be seen in how men and women drive. In this study, GPS-recorded driving dynamics data from 123 drivers, 48 women and 75 men, are analysed and drivers are categorised as aggressive, normal or gentle. A total of 10% of the drivers was categorised as aggressive, with an even distribution between the genders. For the gentle drivers, 11% of the drivers, the men dominated. The driving style investigation was extended to utilise machine learning, confirming the results from statistical tools. As driving style highly impacts a vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption, while switching over to battery electric vehicles it is important to investigate how the different driving styles impact battery utilisation. Two Li-ion battery cell types were tested utilising the same load cycle with three levels of current amplitude, to represent accelerations for the three drive categories. While one cell type was insensitive to the current amplitude, the highly energy-optimised cell proved to be sensitive to higher current amplitudes, corresponding to a more aggressive driving style. Thus, the amplitude of the dynamic current can for some cells be a factor that needs to be considered for lifetime predictions, while it can be neglected for other cells.",

        "title": "Accurate Multi-Scale Feature Fusion CNN for Time Series Classification in Smart Factory",
        "abstract": "Time series classification (TSC) has attracted various attention in the community of machine learning and data mining and has many successful applications such as fault detection and product identification in the process of building a smart factory. However, it is still challenging for the efficiency and accuracy of classification due to complexity, multi-dimension of time series. This paper presents a new approach for time series classification based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The proposed method contains three parts: short-time gap feature extraction, multi-scale local feature learning, and global feature learning. In the process of short-time gap feature extraction, large kernel filters are employed to extract the features within the short-time gap from the raw time series. Then, a multi-scale feature extraction technique is applied in the process of multi-scale local feature learning to obtain detailed representations. The global convolution operation with giant stride is to obtain a robust and global feature representation. The comprehension features used for classifying are a fusion of short time gap feature representations, local multi-scale feature representations, and global feature representations. To test the efficiency of the proposed method named multi-scale feature fusion convolutional neural networks (MSFFCNN), we designed, trained MSFFCNN on some public sensors, device, and simulated control time series data sets. The comparative studies indicate our proposed MSFFCNN outperforms other alternatives, and we also provided a detailed analysis of the proposed MSFFCNN.",

        "abstract": "The correlation of students\u2019 interest in bilingual science learning and their English competence was investigated. Forty-six students of elementary-school teacher candidate program participated in this study. The students received five topics of science (Heat, Changes in Matters, Plant Life and Environment, Simple Machine, Animal Life and Environment) with English usage embedded. The students\u2019 interest in science learning involving English was examined. Meanwhile, the students\u2019 mastery of general English was measured. The result shows that the students\u2019 interest in bilingual science learning and their English mastery is not significantly correlated. The finding suggests that the students might still enjoy and get benefit from bilingual science learning despite their English abilities. This leads to the opportunity to have more bilingual science classes to enhance not only students\u2019 science mastery but also their English competence.",

        "title": "Weather Condition Clustering for Improvement of Photovoltaic Power Plant Generation Forecasting Accuracy",
        "abstract": "Together with the growing interest towards renewable energy sources within the framework of different strategies of various countries, the number of solar power plants keeps growing. However, managing optimal power generation for solar power plants has its own challenges. First comes the problem of work interruption and reduction in power generation. As the system must be tolerant to the faults, the relevance and significance of short-term forecasting of solar power generation becomes crucial. Within the framework of this research, the applicability of different forecasting methods for short-time forecasting is explained. The main goal of the research is to show an approach regarding how to make the forecast more accurate and overcome the above-mentioned challenges using opensource data as features. The data clustering algorithm based on KMeans is proposed to train unique models for specific groups of data samples to improve the generation forecast accuracy. Based on practical calculations, machine learning models based on Random Forest algorithm are selected which have been proven to have higher efficiency in predicting the generation of solar power plants. The proposed algorithm was successfully tested in practice, with an achieved accuracy near to 90%.",

        "abstract": "Fire is a typical disaster in the processing industry. Ionic liquids, as a type of green flame retardant, play an important role in process safety. In order to grasp the current research status, hotspots, and frontiers in the field of ionic liquids in flame retardancy, the bibliometric mapping method is applied to study the relevant literature in Web of Science datasets from 2000\u20132022 in this paper. The results show that the research on ionic liquids in flame retardancy is multidisciplinary and involves some disciplines such as energy science, material science, and environmental protection. Journal of Power Sources, Polymer Degradation and Stability, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, and Chemical Engineering Journal are the core journals in the field. The results of keyword co-occurrence indicate that the hotspots of research can be divided into five components: the improvement and application of pure ionic liquids electrolytes, the research of gel polymer electrolytes, applying ionic liquids to enhance the polymer materials\u2019 flame retardancy properties, utilizing ionic liquids and inorganic materials to synergize flame retardant polymers, and using ionic liquids flame retardant to improve material\u2019s multiple properties. The burst terms and time zone diagram\u2019s results point out the combination of computational quantum chemistry to study the flame retardancy mechanism of ionic liquids, the study of fluorinated electrolytes, ionic liquids for smoke suppression, phosphorus-containing ionic liquids for flame retardant, and machine learning-assisted design of ILs flame retardants are the research frontiers and future research trends.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. This study explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and citizen engagement in improving road safety for vulnerable populations (pedestrians, cyclists) in Genoa, Italy. Aligned with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the project aims for a 50% reduction in traffic accidents by 2030.The AI4PublicPolicy initiative introduces the Virtual Policy Management Environment (VPME) platform. VPME utilizes ML, Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and chatbots to empower the policy development lifecycle. Citizen feedback is integrated through workshops and surveys, fostering a citizen-centric approach. The Genoa pilot program demonstrates VPME's capabilities. ML models analyse historical accident and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to predict future high-risk areas. These predictions inform resource allocation and targeted interventions for pedestrian crossings and school walking routes (\"Pedibus\"). Dashboards visualize the model outputs, allowing users to assess risk levels and predict accident occurrences. Future improvements include incorporating additional data sources (demographics, real-time traffic) for enhanced model accuracy. Citizen engagement played a vital role. Co-creation workshops facilitated stakeholder participation in defining Use Cases, User Stories, and project objectives. Discussions focused on integrating data from environmental, traffic, and citizen reporting systems with VPME solutions. Participants evaluated the project approach and provided valuable feedback. The project highlights the potential of AI and citizen collaboration for data-driven policymaking. This approach empowers municipalities to make informed decisions that prioritize public safety and well-being.\n",

So in this project, we mainly try to propose another depiction learning strategy to handle this issue known as SEMdae. Here the semantic augmentation comprises of predefined words that contain noise or abused meaning which is posted into the database by the admin and these words are classified based on the five categories that are available in the literature like \u201cHATE, VULGAR, OFFENSIVE, SEX, and VOILENCE\u201d.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDiagnostic errors are an underappreciated cause of preventable mortality in hospitals and pose a risk for severe patient harm and increase hospital length of stay.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to explore the potential of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in improving diagnostic safety surveillance. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of the feasibility and potential to use electronic health records clinical notes and existing case review data.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSafety Learning System case review data from 1 large health system composed of 10 hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from February 2016 to September 2021 were analyzed. The case review outcome included opportunities for improvement including diagnostic opportunities for improvement. To supplement case review data, electronic health record clinical notes were extracted and analyzed. A simple logistic regression model along with 3 forms of logistic regression models (ie, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Ridge, and Elastic Net) with regularization functions was trained on this data to compare classification performances in classifying patients who experienced diagnostic errors during hospitalization. Further, statistical tests were conducted to find significant differences between female and male patients who experienced diagnostic errors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 126 (7.4%) patients (of 1704) had been identified by case reviewers as having experienced at least 1 diagnostic error. Patients who had experienced diagnostic error were grouped by sex: 59 (7.1%) of the 830 women and 67 (7.7%) of the 874 men. Among the patients who experienced a diagnostic error, female patients were older (median 72, IQR 66-80 vs median 67, IQR 57-76; P=.02), had higher rates of being admitted through general or internal medicine (69.5% vs 47.8%; P=.01), lower rates of cardiovascular-related admitted diagnosis (11.9% vs 28.4%; P=.02), and lower rates of being admitted through neurology department (2.3% vs 13.4%; P=.04). The Ridge model achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.885), specificity (0.797), positive predictive value (PPV; 0.24), and F1-score (0.369) in classifying patients who were at higher risk of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings demonstrate that natural language processing can be a potential solution to more effectively identifying and selecting potential diagnostic error cases for review and therefore reducing the case review burden.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning surrogate models for quantum mechanical simulations have enabled the field to efficiently and accurately study material and molecular systems. Developed models typically rely on a substantial amount of data to make reliable predictions of the potential energy landscape or careful active learning (AL) and uncertainty estimates. When starting with small datasets, convergence of AL approaches is a major outstanding challenge which has limited most demonstrations to online AL. In this work we demonstrate a \u0394-machine learning (ML) approach that enables stable convergence in offline AL strategies by avoiding unphysical configurations with initial datasets as little as a single data point. We demonstrate our framework\u2019s capabilities on a structural relaxation, transition state calculation, and molecular dynamics simulation, with the number of first principle calculations being cut down anywhere from 70%\u201390%. The approach is incorporated and developed alongside AMPtorch, an open-source ML potential package, along with interactive Google Colab notebook examples.",

        "abstract": "Real intervention and treatment standards drew attention to remote health monitoring frameworks. Remote monitoring frameworks for disease detection at an early stage are opposed by most conventional works. Even so, it ran into issues like increased operational complexity, higher resource costs, inaccurate predictions, longer data collection times, and a lower convergence rate. A remote health monitoring framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict heart disease and diabetes from medical datasets is the goal of this project. Patients' health data is collected via smart devices, and the resulting data is then combined using a variety of nodes, including a detection node, a visualisation node, and a prognostic node. People with long-term illnesses (such as the elderly and disabled) are in such greater demand than ever before that a new approach to healthcare delivery is essential. In the evolved paradigm, conventional physical medical services foundations like clinics, nursing homes, and long haul care offices will be old. Due to recent advancements in modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the smart healthcare system has become increasingly necessary (ML). This paper will discuss wearable and smartphone technologies, AI for medical diagnostics, and assistive structures, including social robots, that have been created for the surrounding upheld living climate. The review presents programming reconciliation structures that are urgent for consolidating information examination and other man-made consciousness instruments to develop brilliant medical care frameworks (AI).",

        "abstract": "Purpose Radiomic models elaborate geometric and texture features of tumors extracted from imaging to develop predictors for clinical outcomes. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT. Materials and Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I\u2013II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors. Results Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794\u20130.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873\u20130.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789\u20130.915), respectively. Conclusion Radiomic analysis of pre-treatment CT scan is a promising tool that can predict tumor response to SBRT.",

We apply machine learning techniques to detect and classify objects of interest for first responders and create a comprehensive 3D indoor space database with annotated safety-related objects. This paper documents the challenges we encountered in data collection and processing, and it presents a complete 3D mapping and labeling system for the environments inside and adjacent to buildings. Moreover, we use a case study to illustrate our process and show preliminary evaluation",

        "abstract": "Calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal\u2010induced nephropathies comprise a range of kidney disorders, for which there are no efficient pharmacological treatments. Although CaOx crystallization inhibitors have been suggested as a therapeutic modality already decades ago, limited progress has been made in the discovery of potent molecules with efficacy in animal disease models. Herein, an image\u2010based machine learning approach to systematically screen chemically modified myo\u2010inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) analogues is utilized, which enables the identification of a highly active divalent inositol phosphate molecule. To date, this is the first molecule shown to completely inhibit the crystallization process in the nanomolar range, reduce crystal\u2013cell interactions, thereby preventing CaOx\u2010induced transcriptomic changes, and decrease renal CaOx deposition and kidney injury in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria. In conclusion, IP6 analogues based on such a scaffold may represent a new treatment option for CaOx nephropathies.",

        "abstract": "Clustering is a very popular machine-learning technique that is often used in data exploration of continuous variables. In general, there are two problems commonly encountered in clustering: (1) the selection of the optimal number of clusters, and (2) the undecidability of the affiliation of border data points to neighboring clusters. We address both problems and describe how to solve them in application to affective multimedia databases. In the experiment, we used the unsupervised learning algorithm k-means and the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS) dataset, which contains 1356 semantically and emotionally annotated pictures. The optimal number of centroids was estimated, using the empirical elbow and silhouette rules, and validated using the Monte-Carlo simulation approach. Clustering with k = 1\u201350 centroids is reported, along with dominant picture keywords and descriptive statistical parameters. Affective multimedia databases, such as the NAPS, have been specifically designed for emotion and attention experiments. By estimating the optimal cluster solutions, it was possible to gain deeper insight into affective features of visual stimuli. Finally, a custom software application was developed for study in the Python programming language. The tool uses the scikit-learn library for the implementation of machine-learning algorithms, data exploration and visualization. The tool is freely available for scientific and non-commercial purposes.",

Robotic perception, in the scope of this chapter, encom - passes the ML algorithms and techniques that empower robots to learn from sensory data and, based on learned models, to react and take decisions accordingly. The recent developments in machine learning, namely deep-learning approaches, are evident and, consequently, robotic perception systems are evolving in a way that new applications and tasks are becoming a reality. Recent advances in human-robot interaction, complex robotic tasks, intelligent reasoning, and decision-making are, at some extent, the results of the notorious evolution and success of ML algorithms. This chapter will cover recent and emerging topics and use-cases related to intelligent perception systems in robotics.",

        "abstract": "Gender identification represents a fundamental component of speech recognition and automatic interacting sound responding systems. Identifying the voice gender minimizes the computational loads of these systems for additional processing. Standard approaches for gender estimation from the speech have broadly relied on the extraction of speech features and classification tasks. This paper proposes a technique for gender identification of speech samples using the speech recognition process. The proposed technique extracts essential voice features like Mean, Zero-Crossing, Standard Deviation, and Amplitude, as well as 12 most significant features from every voice sample, and combines them to create voice feature vectors. The proposed technique uses several machine and deep learning methods such as Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and CNNs, in order to classify the voice vectors into Male and Female classes. After comparing the evaluation metrics results of all classifiers, the proposed technique finds out that the CNN model is the best classifier used to classify the voice vectors with a higher precision value of 1.0.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Insomnia is the most common form of sleep deprivation (SD) observed in clinics. Although there are differences between insomnia and SD, they have similar symptoms and the same animal model. Currently, there is a lack of microarray data on insomnia. Therefore, for now, we are going to apply the SD data to insomnia. Although many studies have explained the possible mechanisms associated with insomnia, no previous studies have considered the key genes associated with insomnia or the relationship between insomnia and immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between key genes and immune cells by identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of insomnia. Next, we verified the efficacy of these biomarkers experimentally. Methods First, we downloaded four microarrays (GSE11755, GSE12624, GSE28750, and GSE48080) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 239 normal human blood samples and 365 blood specimens from patients with SD. Then, we analyzed two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model to investigate these key genes. Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not. Discussion In summary, we identified a key gene (C2CD2L) that may facilitate the development of biomarkers for insomnia.",

We analyzed 7147 Croatian business entities operating in different industries in this paper. The starting point in this research is to identify subjects, which could be users of I4.0 or its elements, based on the similarity of indicators with indicators of a sample of 58 identified I4.0 companies. We developed a machine-learning model by using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) for this purpose, an approach that has not been used in any similar research. This research shows that the main difference between I4.0 and traditional industry is mostly observable in significantly better business performance of investment indicators, cost efficiency, technical equipment and market competitiveness. We identified 141 companies (1.97% of total analyzed sample) as potential users of I4.0, which makes up around 27% of total assets of the analyzed sample and around 26% of revenues.",

Email: Abdelaziz@cis.asu.edu.eg Abstract Academic advising is a crucial process in higher education and usually requires better understanding of student capabilities and curriculum structure to achieve its intended goals. Here, the authors propose a framework of integrated environment based on multi\u2010 agents to automate the full process of academic advising. The proposed framework consists of six agents namely, student agent, instructor agent, administrator agent, performance agent, schedule agent, and smart advisor agent. These agents are interacting together with the help of smart advisor agent, which manages the communication between them and provides smart advice based on machine learning techniques. In addition, the analysis of the proposed framework along with the deployment map is discussed by the authors. Moreover, a case study is presented in terms of a sample part of adaptive multi\u2010agent smart academic advising framework to demonstrate the workflow of the proposed approach.",

Ontologies are often considered a fine source of semantics and interoperability in all artificially smart systems. Exponential increase in unstructured data on the web has made automated acquisition of ontology from unstructured text a most prominent research area. Several methodologies exploiting numerous techniques of various fields (machine learning, text mining, knowledge representation and reasoning, information retrieval and natural language processing) are being proposed to bring some level of automation in the process of ontology acquisition from unstructured text. This paper describes the process of ontology learning and further classification of ontology learning techniques into three classes (linguistics, statistical and logical) and discusses many algorithms under each category. This paper also explores ontology evaluation techniques by highlighting their pros and cons. Moreover, it describes the scope and use of ontology learning in several industries. Finally, the paper discusses challenges of ontology learning along with their corresponding future directions.",

        "title": "Design of Badminton Technical Movement Recognition System Based on Improved Agnes Algorithm",
        "abstract": "The Badminton Technical Movement Recognition System is a technology-driven solution aimed at identifying and analyzing various technical movements performed by badminton players during gameplay. Leveraging advanced sensors, motion tracking devices, and machine learning algorithms, this system captures and interprets data related to player movements, racket swings, footwork, and other key actions on the court. By analyzing this data in real-time or post-match, coaches, players, and analysts can gain valuable insights into performance, technique, and areas for improvement. The system's ability to recognize and quantify specific movements allows for detailed performance assessment, personalized training programs, and strategic game planning. The Badminton Technical Movement Recognition System serves as a powerful tool for enhancing player development and optimizing performance in the sport of badminton. The paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of the Multi-Modal AGNES algorithm across diverse domains, encompassing movement pattern estimation, modal feature extraction, coordinate estimation, and badminton feature estimation. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, the algorithm's efficacy in accurately identifying movement patterns, robustly extracting features from varied datasets, precisely localizing objects in three-dimensional space, and proficiently estimating badminton-specific metrics has been demonstrated. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, the algorithm's efficacy in accurately identifying movement patterns, robustly extracting features from varied datasets, precisely localizing objects in three-dimensional space, and proficiently estimating badminton-specific metrics has been demonstrated. For instance, the algorithm achieved an average accuracy of 90% in classifying movement patterns in a dataset of 1000 observations. Additionally, it accurately estimated modal features such as swing speed, racket angle, and shuttlecock speed with a mean error rate of less than 5%. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

        "title": "Combining phylogeny and coevolution improves the inference of interaction partners among paralogous proteins",
        "abstract": "Predicting protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important goal of computational biology. Various sources of information can be used to this end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of sequences is modest. Author summary When two protein families interact, their sequences feature statistical dependencies. First, interacting proteins tend to share a common evolutionary history. Second, maintaining structure and interactions through the course of evolution yields coevolution, detectable via correlations in the amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",

        "title": "Recent trends in marine microplastic modeling and machine learning tools: Potential for long-term microplastic monitoring",
        "abstract": "The increase in the global demand for plastics, and more recently during the pandemic, is a major concern for the future of plastic waste pollution and microplastics. Efficient microplastic monitoring is imperative to understanding the long-term effects and progression of microplastic effects in the environment. Numerical models are valuable in studying microplastic transport as they can be used to examine the effects of different parameters systematically to help elucidate the fate and transport processes of microplastics, thus providing a holistic view of microplastics in the ocean environment. By incorporating physical parameters (such as size, shape, density, and identity of microplastics), numerical models have gained better understanding of the physics of microplastic transport, predicted sinking velocities more accurately, and estimated microplastic pathways in marine environments. However, availability of large amounts of information about microplastic physical and chemical parameters is sparse. Machine learning and computer-vision tools can aid in acquiring environmental information and provide input to develop more accurate models and verify their predictions. More accurate models can further the understanding of microplastic transport, facilitate monitoring efforts, and thus optimize where more data collection can take place to ultimately improve machine learning tools. This review offers a perspective on how image-based machine learning can be exploited to help uncover the physics of microplastic transport behaviors. Additionally, the authors hope the review inspires studies that can bridge the gap between numerical modeling and machine learning for microplastic analysis to exploit their joined potential.",

        "abstract": "The machine learning techniques for Markov random fields are fundamental in various fields involving pattern recognition, image processing, sparse modeling, and earth science, and a Boltzmann machine is one of the most important models in Markov random fields. However, the inference and learning problems in the Boltzmann machine are NP-hard. The investigation of an effective learning algorithm for the Boltzmann machine is one of the most important challenges in the field of statistical machine learning. In this paper, we study Boltzmann machine learning based on the (first-order) spatial Monte Carlo integration method, referred to as the 1-SMCI learning method, which was proposed in the author\u2019s previous paper. In the first part of this paper, we compare the method with the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation (MPLE) method using a theoretical and a numerical approaches, and show the 1-SMCI learning method is more effective than the MPLE. In the latter part, we compare the 1-SMCI learning method with other effective methods, ratio matching and minimum probability flow, using a numerical experiment, and show the 1-SMCI learning method outperforms them.",

        "abstract": "Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is considered as one of the most efficient forecasting techniques which can be implemented for the prediction of weather occurrence. As with any machine learning implementation, the challenge on the utilization of MLPNN in rainfall forecasting lies in the development and evaluation of MLPNN models which delivers optimal forecasting performance. This research conducted performance analysis of MLPNN models through data preparation, model designing, and model evaluation in order to determine which parameters are the best-fit configurations for MLPNN model implementation in rainfall forecasting. During rainfall data preparation, imputation process and spatial correlation evaluation of weather variables from various weather stations showed that the geographical location of the chosen weather stations did not have a direct correlation between stations with respect to rainfall behavior leading to the decision of utilizing the weather station having the most complete weather data to be fed in the MLPNN. By conducting performance analysis of MLPNN models with different combinations of training algorithms, activation functions, learning rate, and momentum, it was found out that MLPNN model having 100 hidden neurons with Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm and Sigmoid activation function delivered the lowest RMSE of 0.031537 while another MLPNN model having the same number of hidden neurons, the same activation function but Resilient Propagation as training algorithm had the lowest MAE of 0.0209. The results of this research showed that performance analysis of MLPNN models is a crucial process in model implementation of MLPNN for week-ahead rainfall forecasting.",

        "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which outcomes vary among different racial groups. We leverage cell-sorted RNA-seq data (CD14+ monocytes, B cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells) from 120 SLE patients (63 Asian and 57 White individuals) and apply a four-tier approach including unsupervised clustering, differential expression analyses, gene co-expression analyses, and machine learning to identify SLE subgroups within this multiethnic cohort. K-means clustering on each cell-type resulted in three clusters for CD4 and CD14, and two for B and NK cells. To understand the identified clusters, correlation analysis revealed significant positive associations between the clusters and clinical parameters including disease activity as well as ethnicity. We then explored differentially expressed genes between Asian and White groups for each cell-type. The shared differentially expressed genes across cells were involved in SLE or other autoimmune-related pathways. Co-expression analysis identified similarly regulated genes across samples and grouped these genes into modules. Finally, random forest classification of disease activity in the White and Asian cohorts showed the best classification in CD4+ T cells in White individuals. The results from these analyses will help stratify patients based on their gene expression signatures to enable SLE precision medicine. Gaia Andreoletti et al. leverage cell-sorted RNA-seq data and machine learning to investigate gene expression patterns in immune cell subtypes purified from Asian and White patients with a medical diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). They report distinct clinical subtypes of SLE and identify ethnicity- and disease-specific gene clusters, potentially contributing toward the future development of personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with SLE.",

        "abstract": "Mechanical ventilation techniques are vital for preserving individuals with a serious condition lives in the prolonged hospitalization unit. Nevertheless, an imbalance amid the hospitalized people demands and the respiratory structure could cause to inconsistencies in the patient\u2019s inhalation. To tackle this problem, this study presents an Iterative Learning PID Controller (ILC-PID), a unique current cycle feedback type controller that helps in gaining the correct pressure and volume. The paper also offers a clear and complete examination of the primarily efficient neural approach for generating optimal inhalation strategies. Moreover, machine learning-based classifiers are used to evaluate the precision and performance of the ILC-PID controller. These classifiers able to forecast and choose the perfect type for various inhalation modes, eliminating the likelihood that patients will require mechanical ventilation. In pressure control, the suggested accurate neural categorization exhibited an average accuracy rate of 88.2% in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode and 91.7% in proportional assist ventilation (PAV) mode while comparing with the other classifiers like ensemble classifier has reduced accuracy rate of 69.5% in CPAP mode and also 71.7% in PAV mode. An average accuracy of 78.9% rate in other classifiers compared to neutral network in CPAP. The neural model had an typical range of 81.6% in CPAP mode and 84.59% in PAV mode for 20 cm H2O of volume created by the neural network classifier in the volume investigation. Compared to the other classifiers, an average of 72.17% was in CPAP mode, and 77.83% was in PAV mode in volume control. Different approaches, such as decision trees, optimizable Bayes trees, naive Bayes trees, nearest neighbour trees, and an ensemble of trees, were also evaluated regarding the accuracy by confusion matrix concept, training duration, specificity, sensitivity, and F1 score.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Adverse drug events (ADEs) are associated with poor outcomes and increased costs but may be prevented with prediction tools. With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding. Methods The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit\u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features ( n \u2009=\u200988) were selected with clinicians\u2019 input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in\u2009>\u20090.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. Results There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632\u20130.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs. Conclusions We demonstrated feasibility of predicting ADEs using ML. Incorporating genomic features and drug interactions with deep learning models may improve ADE prediction.",

        "abstract": "The paper reports a study into recommendation algorithms and determination of their advantages and disadvantages. The method for developing recommendations based on collaborative filtering such as Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and hybrid methods of Machine Learning (ML) has been improved. The paper describes the design principles and functional requirements to a recommendation system in the form of a Web application for choosing the content required by user using movies as an example. The research has focused on solving issues related to cold start and scalability within the method of collaborative filtering. To effectively address these tasks, we have used hybrid training methods. A hybrid recommendation system (HRS) has been practically implemented for providing relevant content recommendations using movies as an example, taking into consideration the user's personal preferences based on the constructed hybrid method. We have improved an algorithm for developing content recommendations based on the collaborative filtering and Machine Learning for the combined filtration of similarity indicators among users or goods. The hybrid algorithm receives initial information in a different form, normalizes it, and generates relevant recommendations based on a combination of CF and CBF methods. Machine Learning is capable of defining those factors that influence the selection of relevant films, which improves development of recommendations specific to the user. To solve these tasks, a new improved method has been proposed, underlying which, in contrast to existing systems of recommendations, are the hybrid methods and Machine Learning. Machine Learning data for the designed HRS were borrowed from MovieLens. We have analyzed methods for developing recommendations to the user; existing recommendation systems have been reviewed. Our experimental results demonstrate that the operational indicators for the proposed HRS, based on the technology of CF+CBF+ML, outperform those for two individual models, CF and CBF, and such their combinations as CF CBF, CF+ML, and CBF+ML. We recommend using HRS to collect data on people's preferences in selecting goods and to providing relevant recommendations.",

        "title": "Establishment and interpretation of the gamma pass rate prediction model based on radiomics for different intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques in the pelvis",
        "abstract": "Backgroundand objectives: Implementation of patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) is a crucial aspect of precise radiotherapy. Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2\u00a0mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. The F1 scores and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.86, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.86, and 0.81, 0.77, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. The explanation of the model output based on SHAP values can provide a reference basis for medical physicists when adjusting the plan, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of treatment plans.Conclusion: It is feasible to use a machine learning method based on radiomics to establish a gamma pass rate classification prediction model for IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvis. The XGBoost model performs better in classification than the other three tree-based ensemble models, and global explanations and single-sample explanations of the model output through SHAP values may offer reference for medical physicists to provide high-quality plans, promoting the clinical application and implementation of GPR prediction models, and providing safe and efficient personalized QA management for patients.",

        "abstract": "Reliable methods for the classification and quantification of quantum entanglement are fundamental to understanding its exploitation in quantum technologies. One such method, known as separable neural network quantum states (SNNS), employs a neural network inspired parameterization of quantum states whose entanglement properties are explicitly programmable. Combined with generative machine learning methods, this ansatz allows for the study of very specific forms of entanglement which can be used to infer/measure entanglement properties of target quantum states. In this work, we extend the use of SNNS to mixed, multipartite states, providing a versatile and efficient tool for the investigation of intricately entangled quantum systems. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method through a number of examples, such as the computation of novel tripartite entanglement measures, and the approximation of ultimate upper bounds for qudit channel capacities.",

        "abstract": "Background Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity. Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. Methods The multi-institutional PHIS+ clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children\u2019s hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Results Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity . Conclusions NLP-based pneumonia information extraction of pediatric diagnostic imaging reports performed better than domain experts in this pilot study. NLP is an efficient method to extract information from a large collection of imaging reports to facilitate CER.",

        "title": "ADAPTIVE SCHEDULING THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING-BASED PROCESS PARAMETER PREDICTION",
        "abstract": "Detailed manufacturing process data and sensor signals are typically disregarded in production scheduling. However, they have strong relations since a longer processing time triggers a change in schedule. Although promising approaches already exist for mapping the influence of manufacturing processes on production scheduling, the variability of the production environment, including changing process conditions, technological parameters and the status of current orders, is usually ignored. For this reason, this paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that adaptively refines the production schedule by applying Machine Learning (ML)-models during the manufacturing process in order to predict the process-dependent parameters that influence the schedule. With the proper prediction of these parameters based on the process conditions, the production schedule is proactively adjusted to changing conditions not only to ensure the sufficient product quality but also to reduce the negative effects and losses that delayed rescheduling would cause. The proposed approach aims on minimizing the overall lateness by utilizing an active data exchange between the scheduling system and the predictive ML-models on the process level. The efficiency of the solution is demonstrated by a realistic case study using discrete event simulation.",

        "title": "Aircraft Fleet Health Monitoring with Anomaly Detection Techniques",
        "abstract": "Predictive maintenance has received considerable attention in the aviation industry where costs, system availability and reliability are major concerns. In spite of recent advances, effective health monitoring and prognostics for the scheduling of condition-based maintenance operations is still very challenging. The increasing availability of maintenance and operational data along with recent progress made in machine learning has boosted the development of data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) models. In this paper, we describe the data workflow in place at an airline for the maintenance of an aircraft system and highlight the difficulties related to a proper labelling of the health status of such systems, resulting in a poor suitability of supervised learning techniques. We focus on investigating the feasibility and the potential of semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for the health monitoring of a real aircraft system. roposed methods are evaluated on large volumes of real sensor data from a cooling unit system on a modern wide body aircraft from a major European airline. For the sake of confidentiality, data has been anonymized and only few technical and operational details about the system had been made available. We trained several deep neural network autoencoder architectures on nominal data and used the anomaly scores to calculate a health indicator. Results suggest that high anomaly scores are correlated with identified failures in the maintenance logs. Also, some situations see an increase in the anomaly score for several flights prior to the system\u2019s failure, which paves a natural way for early fault identification.",

        "abstract": "High throughput screening determines the effects of many conditions on a given biological target. Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance.

        "title": "Can machine learning make naturalism about health truly naturalistic? A reflection on a data-driven concept of health",
        "abstract": "Through hypothetical scenarios, this paper analyses whether machine learning (ML) could resolve one of the main shortcomings present in Christopher Boorse\u2019s Biostatistical Theory of health (BST). In doing so, it foregrounds the boundaries and challenges of employing ML in formulating a naturalist (i.e., prima facie value-free) definition of health. The paper argues that a sweeping dataist approach cannot fully make the BST truly naturalistic, as prior theories and values persist. It also points out that supervised learning introduces circularity, rendering it incompatible with a naturalistic perspective. Additionally, it underscores the need for pre-existing auxiliary theories to assess results from unsupervised learning. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the epistemological entanglements between data and data processing methods to manage expectations about what data patterns can predict. In conclusion, the paper argues against delegating the final authority for defining complex concepts like health to AI systems, as it necessitates ethical judgment and capacities for deliberation that AI currently lacks. It also warns against granting creators and deployers of AI systems the discretionary authority to determine these definitions outside the wider social discussion, advocating for ongoing public engagement on normative notions. Failure to do so risks limiting individuals and collectives\u2019 ability to shape a just digital future and diminishes their fundamental epistemic agency.",

        "abstract": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the leading cause of illnesses and outbreaks linked to seafood consumption across the globe. Understanding how this pathogen may be adapted to persist along the farm-to-table supply chain has applications for addressing food safety. This study utilized machine learning to develop robust models classifying genomic diversity of V. parahaemolyticus that was isolated from environmental (n\u202f=\u202f176), seafood (n\u202f=\u202f975), and clinical (n\u202f=\u202f865) sample origins. We constructed a pangenome of the respective genome assemblies and employed random forest algorithm to develop predictive models to identify gene clusters encoding metabolism, virulence, and antibiotic resistance that were associated with isolate source type. Comparison of genomes of all seafood-clinical isolates showed high balanced accuracy (\u22650.80) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (\u22650.87) for all of these functional features. Major virulence factors including tdh, trh, type III secretion system-related genes, and four alpha-hemolysin genes (hlyA, hlyB, hlyC, and hlyD) were identified as important differentiating factors in our seafood-clinical virulence model, underscoring the need for further investigation. Significant patterns for AMR genes differing among seafood and clinical samples were revealed from our model and genes conferring to tetracycline, elfamycin, and multidrug (phenicol antibiotic, diaminopyrimidine antibiotic, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic) resistance were identified as the top three key variables. These findings provide crucial insights into the development of effective surveillance and management strategies to address the public health threats associated with V. parahaemolyticus.",

        "title": "Using Machine Learning to Determine Morphologies of z < 1 AGN Host Galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Wide Survey",
        "abstract": "We present a machine-learning framework to accurately characterize the morphologies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within z < 1. We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), and high (0.5 < z < 1.0). By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for \u223c60%\u201370% of the host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of \u223c80%\u201395%, depending on the redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve a disk precision of 96%/82%/79% and bulge precision of 90%/90%/80% (for the three redshift bins) at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of 30%/43%/42%. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging surveys.",

        "title": "Projecting the Thermal Response in a HTGR-Type System during Conduction Cooldown Using Graph-Laplacian Based Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of an off-normal event in a nuclear reactor is dependent upon the availability of sensory data, reactor core physical condition, and understanding of the underlying phenomenon. This work presents a method to project the data from some discrete sensory locations to the overall reactor domain during conduction cooldown scenarios similar to High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). The existing models for conductive cooldown in a heterogeneous multi-body system, such as an assembly of prismatic blocks or pebble beds relies on knowledge of the thermal contact conductance, requiring significant knowledge of local thermal contacts and heat transport possibilities across those contacts. With a priori knowledge of bulk geometry features and some discrete sensors, a machine learning approach was devised. The presented work uses an experimental facility to mimic conduction cooldown with an assembly of 68 cylindrical rods initially heated to 1200 K. High-fidelity temperature data were collected using an infrared (IR) camera to provide training data to the model and validate the predicted temperature data. The machine learning approach used here first converts the macroscopic bulk geometry information into Graph-Laplacian, and then uses the eigenvectors of the Graph-Laplacian to develop Kernel functions. Support vector regression (SVR) was implemented on the obtained Kernels and used to predict the thermal response in a packed rod assembly during a conduction cooldown experiment. The usage of SVR modeling differs from most models today because of its representation of thermal coupling between rods in the core. When trained with thermographic data, the average normalized error is less than 2% over 400 s, during which temperatures of the assembly have dropped by more than 500 K. The rod temperature prediction performance was significantly better for rods in the interior of the assembly compared to those near the exterior, likely due to the model simplification of the surroundings.",

        "abstract": "\u2014Link prediction is a significant field in network science, which focuses on predicting the probability of the existence or formation of a link between nodes in a social network based on currently observed connections. Recently, several efficient link prediction algorithms have been developed, demonstrating robust results in both prediction accuracy and interpretability. However, existing research has not clearly established the relationship between network characteristics and link creation mechanisms. The ability to predict complex networks with diverse features still requires further investigation. In light of this, we introduce a novel framework designed to combine the best features of different link prediction algorithms when applied to the network, with the aim of achieving more reliable predictions about how networks will evolve in consequence. According to the proposed framework, this first focuses on the feature extraction stage. During this phase, we systematically identify and extract a comprehensive set of features from the network before moving on to the classification phase. Here, we utilize state-of-the-art ensemble learning models to assess and classify potential links within the network. By training our Machine Learning (ML) models on the extracted features, we can effectively predict whether a particular link is likely to form (positive link) or unlikely to form (negative link). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: Twitch and Facebook. Additionally, we assessed their performance on these datasets by conducting specific preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning steps. This research makes a significant contribution to improving link prediction in dynamic social networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Recent developments in image recognition technology including artificial intelligence and machine learning led to an intensified research in computer vision models. This progress also allows advances for the collection of spatio-temporal data on Invasive Alien Species (IAS), in order to understand their geographical distribution and impact on the biodiversity loss. Citizen Science (CS) approaches already show successful solutions how the public can be involved in collecting spatio-temporal data on IAS, e.g. by using mobile applications for monitoring. Our work analyzes recently developed image-based species recognition models suitable for the monitoring of IAS in CS applications. We demonstrate how computer vision models can be benchmarked for such a use case and how their accuracy can be evaluated by testing them with IAS of European Union concern. We found out that available models have different strengths. Depending on which criteria (e.g. high species coverage, costs, maintenance, high accuracies) are considered as most important, it needs to be decided individually which model fits best. Using only one model alone may not necessarily be the best solution, thus combining multiple models or developing a new custom model can be desirable. Generally, cooperation with the model providers can be advantageous.\n",

        "abstract": "To improve the understanding of cognitive processing stages, we combined two prominent traditions in cognitive science: evidence accumulation models and stage discovery methods. While evidence accumulation models have been applied to a wide variety of tasks, they are limited to tasks in which decision-making effects can be attributed to a single processing stage. Here, we propose a new method that first uses machine learning to discover processing stages in EEG data and then applies evidence accumulation models to characterize the duration effects in the identified stages. To evaluate this method, we applied it to a previously published associative recognition task (Application 1) and a previously published random dot motion task with a speed-accuracy trade-off manipulation (Application 2). In both applications, the evidence accumulation models accounted better for the data when we first applied the stage-discovery method, and the resulting parameter estimates where generally in line with psychological theories. In addition, in Application 1 the results shed new light on target-foil effects in associative recognition, while in Application 2 the stage discovery method identified an additional stage in the accuracy-focused condition \u2014 challenging standard evidence accumulation accounts. We conclude that the new framework provides a powerful new tool to investigate processing stages.",
