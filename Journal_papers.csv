This paper examines the trends in household charging sessions’ timing, duration, and energy consumption by analyzing real-world residential charging data. By leveraging the information collected from each session, a novel framework is introduced for the efficient, real-time prediction of important charging characteristics. Utilizing historical data and user-specific features, machine learning models are trained to predict the connection duration, charging duration, charging demand, and time until the next session. These models enhance the understanding of EV users’ behavior and provide practical tools for optimizing the EV charging infrastructure and effectively managing the charging demand.

Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” (PAI) reflecting an individual’s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

A potential route to accelerate this process is to employ artificial intelligence methodologies such as machine learning (ML). Herein, the possibility to predict anti‐inflammatory properties of the polymers by using a simplified model of inflammation and a restrained dataset is explored. Cellular assays with 50 different polymers are conducted using the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. These experiments generate a dataset which is used to develop a ML model based on Bayesian logistic regression. After conducting a Bayesian logistic regression analysis, two ML models, K‐nearest neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes, are employed to predict anti‐inflammatory polymers properties. The study finds that the probability of a polymer having anti‐inflammatory properties is multiplied by three if it is a polycation, and that nitric oxide secretion is a good indicator in determining the anti‐inflammatory properties of a polymer, which in this work are defined by tumor necrosis factor alpha expression decrease.

So, they must browse and explore several suggested contents to better assimilate their courses. To facilitate the selecting task of these resources, the present paper proposes an intelligent tutoring system that can access teaching contents available on the web automatically and offers them to learners as additional information sources. In doing so, the authors highlight the description logic approach and its knowledge representation strength that underwrites the modulization, inference, and querying about a web ontology language, and enhanced traditional tutoring systems architecture using ontologies and description logic to enable them to access various data sources on the web.

So, they must browse and explore several suggested contents to better assimilate their courses. To facilitate the selecting task of these resources, the present paper proposes an intelligent tutoring system that can access teaching contents available on the web automatically and offers them to learners as additional information sources. In doing so, the authors highlight the description logic approach and its knowledge representation strength that underwrites the modulization, inference, and querying about a web ontology language, and enhanced traditional tutoring systems architecture using ontologies and description logic to enable them to access various data sources on the web. Finally, this article concludes that the combination of machine learning with the semantic web has provided a supportive study environment and enhanced the schooling conditions within open and distance learning.",International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET),journal,44a8affe-ff49-4c97-915b-0e4378776101,Int.

GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways.

Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 203 patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI before prostate biopsy were included. After manual segmentation, radiomic features (RFs) were extracted from T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, and high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI). Patients were split into training sets and testing sets according to a ratio of 8:2. A pipeline considering combinations of two feature selection (FS) methods and six ML classifiers was developed and evaluated. The performance of models was assessed using the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1-measure, and the area under curve (AUC). Results: On high b-value DWMRI-derived features, a combination of FS method recursive feature elimination (RFE) and classifier random forest achieved the highest performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs, with 97.0% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity, 98.0% precision, and 97.0% F1-measure. The method also achieved an average AUC for GG of 98%. Conclusion: Preoperative mpMRI radiomic analysis based on ML, as a noninvasive approach, showed good performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs.

Specifically, if common variants confer growth advantages, they may have undergone positive selection across different patients due to similar selection pressures. Moreover, studies have demonstrated the significance of rare mutations that arise as resistance mechanisms in response to drug treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of both recurrent and rare variants in cancer. In addition to this, most existing tools for variant prediction focus on distinguishing variants found in normal and disease populations, often without considering the specific disease contexts in which these variants arise.

Here, we introduce CanDrivR-CS, a set of cancer-specific gradient boosting models designed to distinguish between rare and recurrent cancer variants. Results We curated missense variant data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Cancer-type-specific models significantly outperformed a baseline pan-cancer model, achieving a maximum leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) F1 score of up to 90% for CanDrivRSKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma) and 89% for CanDrivR-SKCA (Skin Adenocarcinoma), compared to 79.2% for the baseline model. Notably, DNA shape properties consistently ranked among the top features for distinguishing recurrent and rare variants across all cancers. Specifically, recurrent missense variants frequently occurred in DNA bends and rolls, potentially implicating regions prone to DNA replication errors and acting as mutational hotspots.

Specifically, if common variants confer growth advantages, they may have undergone positive selection across different patients due to similar selection pressures. Moreover, studies have demonstrated the significance of rare mutations that arise as resistance mechanisms in response to drug treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of both recurrent and rare variants in cancer. In addition to this, most existing tools for variant prediction focus on distinguishing variants found in normal and disease populations, often without considering the specific disease contexts in which these variants arise. Instead, they typically build predictors that generalise across all diseases.

It is very important to establish an accurate prediction model of cyanobacterial bloom concentration, which is a challenging issue. Machine learning techniques can improve the prediction accuracy, but a large amount of historical monitoring data is needed to train these models. For some waters with an inconvenient geographical location or frequent sensor failures, there are not enough historical data to train the model. To deal with this problem, a fused model based on a transfer learning method is proposed in this paper. In this study, the data of water environment with a large amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the source domain in order to learn the knowledge of cyanobacterial bloom growth characteristics and train the prediction model. The data of the water environment with a small amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the target domain in order to load the model trained in the source domain. Then, the training set of the target domain is used to participate in the inter-layer fine-tuning training of the model to obtain the transfer learning model. At last, the transfer learning model is fused with a convolutional neural network to obtain the prediction model. Various experiments are conducted for a 2 h prediction on the test set of the target domain. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of cyanobacterial blooms for the water environment with a low data volume.",Water,journal,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,Unknown,Unknown,,2021,2022-04-16,"J.

High levels and complex patterns of spontaneous activity are generally associated with low rates of apoptosis in the cortex. However, whether spontaneous activity patterns directly encode for survival of individual cortical neurons during development remains an open question. Here, we longitudinally investigated spontaneous activity and apoptosis in developing cortical cultures, combining extracellular electrophysiology with calcium imaging. These experiments demonstrated that the early occurrence of calcium transients was strongly linked to neuronal survival. Silent neurons exhibited a higher probability of cell death, whereas high frequency spiking and burst behavior were almost exclusively detected in surviving neurons. In local neuronal clusters, activity of neighboring neurons exerted a pro-survival effect, whereas on the functional level, networks with a high modular topology were associated with lower cell death rates. Using machine learning algorithms, cell fate of individual neurons was predictable through the integration of spontaneous activity features. Our results indicate that high frequency spiking activity constrains apoptosis in single neurons through sustained calcium rises and thereby consolidates networks in which a high modular topology is reached during early development.",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,journal,5b97da83-0106-4e9f-aef2-4c3006afbb2c,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,Unknown,10,,2021,2022-08-10,"David Warm, Davide Bassetti, Jonas Schroer, H.

However, many current studies overlook the relationships between different growth parameters and their varying contributions to yield, leading to overlapping information and lower accuracy in monitoring crop growth. Therefore, this study focuses on winter wheat and constructs a comprehensive growth monitoring index (CGIac), based on adaptive weight allocation of growth parameters’ contribution to yield, using data such as leaf area index (LAI), soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, plant height (PH), biomass (BM), and plant water content (PWC). Using UAV data on vegetation indices, feature selection was performed using the Elastic Net. The growth inversion model was then constructed using machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector regression (SVR). Based on the optimal growth inversion model for winter wheat, spatial distribution of wheat growth in the study area is obtained. The findings demonstrated that CGIac outperforms CGIav (constructed using equal weighting) and CGIcv (built using the coefficient of variation) in yield correlation and prediction accuracy. Specifically, the yield correlation of CGIac improved by up to 0.76 compared to individual indices, while yield prediction accuracy increased by up to 23.14%. Among the evaluated models, the RF model achieved the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.895 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0058. A comparison with wheat orthophotos from the same period confirmed that the inversion results were highly consistent with actual growth conditions in the study area.

This scheduling problem involves strategically managing the limited stored hydro energy in coordination with the electricity system. The scenario fan problem, selected as a long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling approach, can effectively represent the individual hydropower plants and their short‐term flexibility within the long‐term scheduling process, making it well‐suited for capturing the disaggregated physical characteristics of hydro stations. However, the computational burden of scenario fan problem increases due to the complexity of the cascaded system and the large number of inflow scenarios. To tackle these challenges, a machine learning clustering method is developed for extracting shape‐based features to capture the energy and shape attributes of hydro inflows. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing it with four established clustering methods. This evaluation was carried out on a hydro‐thermal test case, utilizing both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample data analysis. The findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other methods in terms of computational time by 42.6% and optimal reservoir trajectories by 12.1% considering K‐means using Euclidean distance as the benchmark.

This scheduling problem involves strategically managing the limited stored hydro energy in coordination with the electricity system. The scenario fan problem, selected as a long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling approach, can effectively represent the individual hydropower plants and their short‐term flexibility within the long‐term scheduling process, making it well‐suited for capturing the disaggregated physical characteristics of hydro stations. However, the computational burden of scenario fan problem increases due to the complexity of the cascaded system and the large number of inflow scenarios. To tackle these challenges, a machine learning clustering method is developed for extracting shape‐based features to capture the energy and shape attributes of hydro inflows. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing it with four established clustering methods. This evaluation was carried out on a hydro‐thermal test case, utilizing both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample data analysis. The findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other methods in terms of computational time by 42.6% and optimal reservoir trajectories by 12.1% considering K‐means using Euclidean distance as the benchmark.

In particular, toddler’s unique behaviors, such as riding in a stroller or being carried by an adult, have not yet been examined. The objective of this study was to describe accelerometry signal outputs recorded during participation in nine types of behaviors (i.e., running, walking, climbing up/down, crawling, riding a ride-on toy, standing, sitting, riding in a stroller/wagon, and being carried by an adult) among toddlers. Twenty-four toddlers aged 13 to 35 months (50% girls) performed various prescribed behaviors during free play in a commercial indoor playroom while wearing ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on a hip and a wrist. Participants’ performances were video-recorded. Based on the video data, accelerometer data were annotated with behavior labels to examine accelerometry signal outputs while performing the nine types of behaviors. Accelerometer data collected during 664 behavior assessments from the 21 participants were used for analysis. Hip vertical axis counts for walking were low (median = 49 counts/5 s). They were significantly lower than those recorded while a toddler was “carried” by an adult (median = 144 counts/5 s; p < 0.01). While standing, sitting, and riding in a stroller, very low hip vertical axis counts were registered (median ≤ 5 counts/5 s). Although wrist vertical axis and vector magnitude counts for “carried” were not higher than those for walking, they were higher than the cut-points for sedentary behaviors. Using various accelerometry signal features, machine learning techniques showed 89% accuracy to differentiate the “carried” behavior from ambulatory movements such as running, walking, crawling, and climbing.

In the current scenario, machine learning and/or deep learning are becoming very popular in medical science for disease prediction. Much research is underway in the form of disease prediction models by machine learning. To ensure the performance and accuracy of the machine learning model, it is important to keep some basic things in mind during training.

A systemic review and a meta-analysis. We also provided a retrospective cohort for validation in this study.


OBJECTIVE
(1) Using a meta-analysis to determine the pooled discriminatory ability of The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classical algorithm (CA) and machine learning algorithms (MLA); and (2) test the hypothesis that SORG-CA has less variability in performance than SORG-MLA in non-American validation cohorts as SORG-CA does not incorporates regional-specific variables such as body mass index as input.


METHODS
After data extraction from the included studies, logit-transformation was applied for extracted AUCs for further analysis. The discriminatory abilities of both algorithms were directly compared by their logit (AUC)s. Further subgroup analysis by region (America vs non-America) was also conducted by comparing the corresponding logit (AUC).


RESULTS
The pooled logit (AUC)s of 90-day SORG-CA was .82 (95% confidence interval [CI], .53-.11), 1-year SORG-CA was 1.11 (95% CI, .74-1.48), 90-day SORG-MLA was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.63), and 1-year SORG-MLA was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.17-1.98). All the algorithms performed better in United States than in Taiwan (P < .001). The performance of SORG-CA was less influenced by a non-American cohort than SORG-MLA.


CONCLUSION
These observations might highlight the importance of incorporating region-specific variables into existing models to make them generalizable to racially or geographically distinct regions.",Global Spine Journal,journal,405be97c-7be0-49bc-8575-24dba18cd046,Global spine journal,"

A systemic review and a meta-analysis. We also provided a retrospective cohort for validation in this study.


OBJECTIVE
(1) Using a meta-analysis to determine the pooled discriminatory ability of The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classical algorithm (CA) and machine learning algorithms (MLA); and (2) test the hypothesis that SORG-CA has less variability in performance than SORG-MLA in non-American validation cohorts as SORG-CA does not incorporates regional-specific variables such as body mass index as input.


METHODS
After data extraction from the included studies, logit-transformation was applied for extracted AUCs for further analysis. The discriminatory abilities of both algorithms were directly compared by their logit (AUC)s. Further subgroup analysis by region (America vs non-America) was also conducted by comparing the corresponding logit (AUC).

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) complicates clinical manifestations of stroke. In this study, we redefined the CSVD burden score and incorporated it into a novel radiological-clinical prediction model for SAP. Materials and methods A total of 1278 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 were included. The participants were divided into training and testing groups using fivefold cross-validation method. Four models, two traditional statistical models (logistic regression and ISAN) and two machine learning models (random forest and support vector machine), were established and evaluated. The outcomes and baseline characteristics were compared between the SAP and non-SAP groups. Results Among the of 1278 patients, 281(22.0%) developed SAP after their first ICH. Multivariate analysis revealed that the logistic regression (LR) model was superior in predicting SAP in both the training and testing groups. Independent predictors of SAP after ICH included total CSVD burden score (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.54), haematoma extension into ventricle (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.87–3.31), haematoma with multilobar involvement (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.44–3.18), transpharyngeal intubation operation (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.7–5.62), admission NIHSS score ≥ 10 (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.42–3.01), male sex (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16–2.52), and age ≥ 67 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.56–3.22).

Previous studies reveal that disordered regions of a protein can be predicted by its primary structure, the amino acid sequence. One observation that has been widely accepted is that ordered regions usually have compositional bias toward hydrophobic amino acids, and disordered regions are toward charged amino acids. Recent studies further show that employing evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) improves the prediction accuracy of protein disorder. As more and more machine learning techniques have been introduced to protein disorder detection, extracting more useful features with biological insights attracts more attention.ResultsThis paper first studies the effect of a condensed position specific scoring matrix with respect to physicochemical properties (PSSMP) on the prediction accuracy, where the PSSMP is derived by merging several amino acid columns of a PSSM belonging to a certain property into a single column. Next, we decompose each conventional physicochemical property of amino acids into two disjoint groups which have a propensity for order and disorder respectively, and show by experiments that some of the new properties perform better than their parent properties in predicting protein disorder. In order to get an effective and compact feature set on this problem, we propose a hybrid feature selection method that inherits the efficiency of uni-variant analysis and the effectiveness of the stepwise feature selection that explores combinations of multiple features. The experimental results show that the selected feature set improves the performance of a classifier built with Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) in comparison with the feature set constructed with PSSMs or PSSMPs that adopt simply the conventional physicochemical properties.ConclusionDistinguishing disordered regions from ordered regions in protein sequences facilitates the exploration of protein structures and functions. Results based on independent testing data reveal that the proposed predicting model DisPSSMP performs the best among several of the existing packages doing similar tasks, without either under-predicting or over-predicting the disordered regions.

The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations. Computational modelling of chemical systems requires a balance between accuracy and computational cost. Here the authors use transfer learning to develop a general purpose neural network potential that approaches quantum-chemical accuracy for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions.",Nature Communications,journal,43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,Unknown,10,,2017,2019-06-14,"Justin S.

Nowadays, going 24 hours without getting in touch with them in some way has become difficult. Facebook and Twitter, these social platforms are now part of everyday life. Thus, these social networks have become important sources to be aware of frequently discussed topics or public opinions on a current issue. A lot of people write messages about current events, give their opinion on any topic and discuss social issues more and more. The emergence and enormous popularity of these social networks have led to the emergence of several types of analysis to take advantage of them. One of them is the analysis of opinions in texts. It aims at automatically classifying opinions in order to position them on a sentiment scale, thus allowing to characterize a set of opinions without having to rely on a human to read them. Currently, opinion analysis offers us a lot of information related to public opinion, either in the commercial world or in the political world. Many studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB), perform well in this type of classification.

Nowadays, going 24 hours without getting in touch with them in some way has become difficult. Facebook and Twitter, these social platforms are now part of everyday life. Thus, these social networks have become important sources to be aware of frequently discussed topics or public opinions on a current issue. A lot of people write messages about current events, give their opinion on any topic and discuss social issues more and more. The emergence and enormous popularity of these social networks have led to the emergence of several types of analysis to take advantage of them. One of them is the analysis of opinions in texts. It aims at automatically classifying opinions in order to position them on a sentiment scale, thus allowing to characterize a set of opinions without having to rely on a human to read them. Currently, opinion analysis offers us a lot of information related to public opinion, either in the commercial world or in the political world. Many studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB), perform well in this type of classification. In our study, we first propose an approach for tracking and analyzing political opinions in social networks. Then, we propose a trained and evaluated machine learning model for political opinion classification.

Although many NER models based on machine learning have been proposed, their performance in terms of processing fine-grained NER tasks was less than acceptable. This is because the training data of a fine-grained NER task is much more unbalanced than those of a coarse-grained NER task. To overcome the problem presented by unbalanced data, we propose a fine-grained NER model that compensates for the sparseness of fine-grained NEs by using the contextual information of coarse-grained NEs. From another viewpoint, many NER models have used different levels of features, such as part-of-speech tags and gazetteer look-up results, in a nonhierarchical manner. Unfortunately, these models experience the feature interference problem. Our solution to this problem is to adopt a multi-stacked feature fusion scheme, which accepts different levels of features as its input. The proposed model is based on multi-stacked long short-term memories (LSTMs) with a multi-stacked feature fusion layer for acquiring multilevel embeddings and a dual-stacked output layer for predicting fine-grained NEs based on the categorical information of coarse-grained NEs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed model is capable of state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the proposed model can effectively alleviate the unbalanced data problem that frequently occurs in a fine-grained NER task. In addition, the multi-stacked feature fusion layer contributes to the improvement of NER performance, confirming that the proposed model can alleviate the feature interference problem. Based on this experimental result, we conclude that the proposed model is well-designed to effectively perform NER tasks.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,,2020,2021-11-15,"Hongjin Kim, Harksoo Kim","2110134563, 2108880610",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0014ecb6e7055de7b3bef3d5619446c24fdf0db4,"Computer Science, Linguistics",2110134563,,,

Conveniently, these compact devices are also equipped with high-precision transducers such as accelerometers and microphones, integrated mechanically and designed on-board to support a range of user functionalities. However, unintended access to these transducer signals (bypassing normal on-board data access controls) may allow sensitive user interaction information to be detected and thereby exploited. In this study, we show that acoustic features extracted from the on-board microphone signals, supported with accelerometer and gyroscope signals, may be used together with machine learning techniques to successfully determine the user’s touch input location on a touchscreen: our ensemble model, namely the random forest model, predicts touch input location with up to 86% accuracy in a realistic scenario. Accordingly, we present the approach and techniques used, the performance of the model developed, and also discuss limitations and possible mitigation methods to thwart possible exploitation of such unintended signal channels.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,4834,11,,2020,2021-05-25,"K.

In this study, we show that acoustic features extracted from the on-board microphone signals, supported with accelerometer and gyroscope signals, may be used together with machine learning techniques to successfully determine the user’s touch input location on a touchscreen: our ensemble model, namely the random forest model, predicts touch input location with up to 86% accuracy in a realistic scenario. Accordingly, we present the approach and techniques used, the performance of the model developed, and also discuss limitations and possible mitigation methods to thwart possible exploitation of such unintended signal channels.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,4834,11,,2019,2021-05-25,"K.

This research focuses on exploring the latest solutions in preventing DDoS attacks and emphasizes how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is involved in enhancing end-to-end detection techniques. Through the analysis of several key approaches, this work notes that AI-guided models quickly identify and counteract any unusual traffic patterns that may indicate an oncoming DDoS attack. Essential aspects towards creating more resilient networks against such attacks include machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data analytics together with AI based detection systems for traffic pattern recognition. Importantly, AI does well in behavioral analysis because it can distinguish and adapt to changing attack vectors.

The current prognosis approaches include radiological examination and detection of serum biomarkers, however, both have limited efficiency and are ineffective in early prognosis. Due to such limitations, we propose to use RNA-Seq data for evaluating putative higher accuracy biomarkers at the transcript level that could help in early prognosis. To identify such potential transcript biomarkers, RNA-Seq data for healthy liver and various HCC cell models were subjected to five different machine learning algorithms: random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and neural networks. Various metrics, namely sensitivity, specificity, MCC, informedness, and AUC-ROC (except for support vector machine) were evaluated. The algorithms that produced the highest values for all metrics were chosen to extract the top features that were subjected to recursive feature elimination. Through recursive feature elimination, the least number of features were obtained to differentiate between the healthy and HCC cell models. From the metrics used, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of the known protein biomarkers for HCC is comparatively lower than complete transcriptomics data. Among the different machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector machine demonstrated the best performance. Using recursive feature elimination on top features of random forest and support vector machine three transcripts were selected that had an accuracy of 0.97 and kappa of 0.93. Of the three transcripts, two were protein coding (PARP2–202 and SPON2–203) and one was a non-coding transcript (CYREN-211). Lastly, we demonstrated that these three selected transcripts outperformed randomly taken three transcripts (15,000 combinations), hence were not chance findings, and could then be an interesting candidate for new HCC biomarker development. Using RNA-Seq data combined with machine learning approaches can aid in finding novel transcript biomarkers. The three biomarkers identified: PARP2–202, SPON2–203, and CYREN-211, presented the highest accuracy among all other transcripts in differentiating the healthy and HCC cell models. The machine learning pipeline developed in this study can be used for any RNA-Seq dataset to find novel transcript biomarkers.

It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,,2017,2018-08-01,"Y.

STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,17,,2021,2022-08-11,"Mansour Al Sulaiman, Abdullah M.

Neuroimaging and machine learning approaches provide new research directions to explore the brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms after stroke. We applied machine learning to predict the classification of the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for motor improvement and identify the neuroimaging features, in order to explore brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms for motor recovery after stroke. Methods In this study, 49 patients with unilateral motor pathway injury (basal ganglia and/or corona radiata) after ischemic stroke were included and evaluated the motor function by Fugl–Meyer Assessment scores (FMA) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up sessions. Patients were divided by the difference between the twice FMA scores into one group showing minimal clinically important difference (MCID group, n = 28) and the other group with no minimal clinically important difference (N-MCID, n = 21). Machine learning was performed by PRoNTo software to predict the classification of the patients and identify the feature brain regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, a matched group of healthy controls (HC, n = 26) was enrolled. Patients and HC underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination in the resting state and in the acupuncture state (acupuncture at the Yanglingquan point on one side) to compare the differences in brain functional connectivity (FC) and acupuncture effects. Results Through machine learning, we obtained a balance accuracy rate of 75.51% and eight feature ROIs. Compared to HC, we found that the stroke patients with lower FC between these feature ROIs with other brain regions, while patients in the MCID group exhibited a wider range of lower FC. When acupuncture was applied to Yanglingquan (GB 34), the abnormal FC of patients was decreased, with different targets of effects in different groups. Conclusion Feature ROIs identified by machine learning can predict the classification of stroke patients with different motor improvements, and the FC between these ROIs with other brain regions is decreased. Acupuncture can modulate the bilateral cerebral hemispheres to restore abnormal FC via different targets, thereby promoting motor recovery after stroke.

However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection.

The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D.

These methods outperform traditional, rule-based approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of intersecting features. However, existing deep learning-based AFR methods face two major challenges. The initial challenge stems from the frequent utilization of voxelized or point-cloud representations of CAD models, resulting in the unfortunate loss of valuable geometric and topological information inherent in original Boundary representation (B-Rep) models. The second challenge involves the limitation of supervised deep learning methods in identifying machining features that are not present in the predefined dataset. This constraint renders them suboptimal for the continually evolving datasets of real industrial scenarios. To address the first challenge, this study introduces a graph-structured language, Multidimensional Attributed Face-Edge Graph (maFEG), crafted to encapsulate the intricate geometric and topological details of CAD models. Furthermore, a graph neural network, Sheet-metalNet, is proposed for the efficient learning and interpretation of maFEGs. To tackle the second challenge, a three-component incremental learning strategy is proposed: an initial phase of pre-training and fine-tuning, a prototype sampling-based replay, and a stage employing knowledge distillation for parameter regularization.

These methods outperform traditional, rule-based approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of intersecting features. However, existing deep learning-based AFR methods face two major challenges. The initial challenge stems from the frequent utilization of voxelized or point-cloud representations of CAD models, resulting in the unfortunate loss of valuable geometric and topological information inherent in original Boundary representation (B-Rep) models. The second challenge involves the limitation of supervised deep learning methods in identifying machining features that are not present in the predefined dataset. This constraint renders them suboptimal for the continually evolving datasets of real industrial scenarios. To address the first challenge, this study introduces a graph-structured language, Multidimensional Attributed Face-Edge Graph (maFEG), crafted to encapsulate the intricate geometric and topological details of CAD models. Furthermore, a graph neural network, Sheet-metalNet, is proposed for the efficient learning and interpretation of maFEGs. To tackle the second challenge, a three-component incremental learning strategy is proposed: an initial phase of pre-training and fine-tuning, a prototype sampling-based replay, and a stage employing knowledge distillation for parameter regularization. The effectiveness of Sheet-metalNet and its complementary incremental learning strategy is evaluated using the open-source MFCAD++ dataset and the newly created SMCAD dataset.

It is a concern that continues to be analyzed and addressed for solutions. Missing data occurs when there is no data stored for certain variables relating to participants. In health surveys, when participants answer in the form of “I don't know” or “I'd prefer not to answer”, these responses can, in many cases, be categorized as missing data responses from a participant in a specific category or question. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is an essential tool in healthcare and clinical settings to assess an individual's mental health, specifically related to symptoms of depression. The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with the total score obtained by summing the scores for each item. Higher PHQ-8 scores indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. We used empirical data from a previous study on depression symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease to study the effect of considering the answers “I do not know” and “I prefer not to answer” as missing values when estimating the percentage of depression using PHQ-8. Moreover, we studied the effect of the complete case analysis and multiple imputation on parameter estimates and confidence intervals. The outcome of this study aims to shed light on the development of missing data procedural knowledge and provide methodological support for public health decision-making when data with missing values are collected. Furthermore, this study aims to prevent the exclusion of missing data rather than to generate data. Methods A simulation study with 1000 replicates was performed. Four common statistical machine learning methods for handling missing values were included in this study. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-Means, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest (RF) imputations. Five clusters were used for KNN and K-mean. Likewise, five multiple imputations were used for the CART and RF methods. The simulation was based on publicly available data with available PHQ-8 data for 1096 subjects. In the simulation study and for each replication, multivariate missing values were generated using the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% proportions of missingness. The percent of depression was calculated using the PHQ-8 questionnaire and a comparison was made between estimated actual depression, complete-case analysis, KNN, Kmean, RF, and CART, respectively. Results The Median age of the subjects was 69 (interquartile range: 61–67) and more males (72.9%) than females were included in the data. The estimated actual depression was 16.8, whereas the estimated percentage of depression varies between 6.9–13.5, 16.2–16.7, 16.3–16.7, 16.6–16.7 and 16.7–16.8 for the complete case, KNN, Kmean, RF and CART respectively. Conclusion The results of this simulation study show that missing PHQ-8 data are best handled by applying multiple imputations based on CART or RF. However, using K-Means or KNN leads to a good estimate of the true percentage of depression. Furthermore, the results of this simulation study show that complete-case analysis leads to biased estimates of the true percentage of depression.

Thus, data augmentation methods have been developed to improve classifiers by artificially created training data. In NLP, there is the challenge of establishing universal rules for text transformations which provide new linguistic patterns. In this paper, we present and evaluate a text generation method suitable to increase the performance of classifiers for long and short texts. We achieved promising improvements when evaluating short as well as long text tasks with the enhancement by our text generation method. Especially with regard to small data analytics, additive accuracy gains of up to 15.53% and 3.56% are achieved within a constructed low data regime, compared to the no augmentation baseline and another data augmentation technique. As the current track of these constructed regimes is not universally applicable, we also show major improvements in several real world low data tasks (up to +4.84 F1-score). Since we are evaluating the method from many perspectives (in total 11 datasets), we also observe situations where the method might not be suitable.

Therefore, to find an efficient and fast real-time disease image recognition method is very meaningful. Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that can automatically learn representative features to achieve better results in areas of image recognition. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use deep learning methods to identify crop pests and diseases and to find efficient and fast real-time image recognition methods of disease. Deep learning is a newly developed discipline in recent years. Its purpose is to study how to actively obtain a variety of feature representation methods from data samples and rely on data-driven methods, a series of nonlinear transformations are applied to finally collect the original data from specific to abstract, from general to specified semantics, and from low-level to high-level characteristic forms. This paper analyzes the classical and the latest neural network structure based on the theory of deep learning. For the problem that the network based on natural image classification is not suitable for crop pest and disease identification tasks, this paper has improved the network structure that can take care of both recognition speed and recognition accuracy. We discussed the influence of the crop pest and disease feature extraction layer on recognition performance. Finally, we used the inner layer as the main structure to be the pest and disease feature extraction layer by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the inner and global average pooling layers. We analyze various loss functions such as Softmax Loss, Center Loss, and Angular Softmax Loss for pest identification. In view of the shortcomings of difficulty in loss function training, convergence, and operation, making the distance between pests and diseases smaller and the distance between classes more greater improved the loss function and introduced techniques such as feature normalization and weight normalization.

Doppler lidar are hampered by several sources of uncertainty in the lidar
measurement, affecting both bias and random errors. Two problems encountered
especially for nacelle-mounted lidar are solid interference due to
intersection of the line of sight with solid objects behind, within, or in
front of the measurement volume and spectral noise due primarily to
limited photon capture. These two uncertainties, especially that due to
solid interference, can be reduced with high-fidelity retrieval techniques
(i.e., including both quality assurance/quality control and subsequent
parameter estimation). Our work compares three such techniques, including
conventional thresholding, advanced filtering, and a novel application of
supervised machine learning with ensemble neural networks, based on their
ability to reduce uncertainty introduced by the two observed nonideal
spectral features while keeping data availability high. The approach
leverages data from a field experiment involving a continuous-wave (CW)
SpinnerLidar from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) that provided
scans of a wide range of flows both unwaked and waked by a field turbine.
Independent measurements from an adjacent meteorological tower within the
sampling volume permit experimental validation of the instantaneous velocity
uncertainty remaining after retrieval that stems from solid interference and
strong spectral noise, which is a validation that has not been performed
previously. All three methods perform similarly for non-interfered returns,
but the advanced filtering and machine learning techniques perform better
when solid interference is present, which allows them to produce overall
standard deviations of error between 0.2 and 0.3 m s−1, or a 1 %–22 %
improvement versus the conventional thresholding technique, over the rotor
height for the unwaked cases. Between the two improved techniques, the
advanced filtering produces 3.5 % higher overall data availability, while
the machine learning offers a faster runtime (i.e., ∼ 1 s
to evaluate) that is therefore more commensurate with the requirements of
real-time turbine control. The retrieval techniques are described in terms
of application to CW lidar, though they are also relevant to pulsed lidar.
Previous work by the authors (Brown and Herges, 2020) explored a novel
attempt to quantify uncertainty in the output of a high-fidelity lidar
retrieval technique using simulated lidar returns; this article provides
true uncertainty quantification versus independent measurement and does so
for three techniques rather than one.

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from proximal sensors and the high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provide an opportunity to monitor the crop water status efficiently.

Modern machine learning techniques have improved the state of the art in computer vision and catalized re-thinking of key problems, such as recognition and tracking. In turn, vision has broadened the scope of machine learning, offering rich new challenges and highlighting the importance of representations.

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a washing procedure that guarantees effective and safe cleaning. This organization recommends that States promote this activity and monitor it continuously. Based on this fact, this article presents a work oriented to study the feasibility of identifying the moments in which a person carried out a hand washing, determining its beginning and duration, as well as if these washings were compliant with the WHO guidelines. The identification of washing moments is made through the analysis, by means of Machine Learning techniques, of the data that can be collected from the inertial sensors of the smartwatch the person is wearing. This study was carried out with the participation of 15 volunteers. Data was not only collected in controlled settings but, also, more than 600 hours of sensor measurements come from free-live conditions. The results of the study showed that it is feasible to build a solid solution based on the use of low cost wearables for the identification of washing moments. The solution is very effective (with F1 over 95%) with user-dependent models.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stage of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this, we proposed a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. In general we have six machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, classifier and feed forward neural network to establish models. In existing system random forest achieved the performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. In proposed system, By analysing the misjudgments generated by the above model, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron which could achieve an efficient accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.

The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease’s onset. The findings underline the potential of machine learning to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and therapy planning while emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in artificial intelligence-based healthcare systems.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,5618-5633,13,,2024,,"Tarek Khater, A.

The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease’s onset. The findings underline the potential of machine learning to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and therapy planning while emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in artificial intelligence-based healthcare systems.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,5618-5633,13,,2023,,"Tarek Khater, A.

The severity of MS disease is monitored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, composed of several functional sub-scores. Early and accurate classification of MS disease severity is critical for slowing down or preventing disease progression via applying early therapeutic intervention strategies. Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) create opportunities to apply data-driven and predictive modeling tools for this goal. Previous studies focusing on using single-modal machine learning and deep learning algorithms were limited in terms of prediction accuracy due to data insufficiency or model simplicity.

Our contribution has two main facets. First, we describe a pioneering effort to integrate structured EHR data, neuroimaging data and clinical notes to build a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict patient’s MS severity.

Regional ethnic traditional sports are not only a sports business but also a tourism resource. The construction of a reasonable regional sports tourism resource classification model is fundamental to the development of sports tourism resources. However, the existing sports tourism resources classification is mostly constructed manually based on the national standard tourism resources classification system. The efficiency and accuracy of the traditional manual classification are poor and cannot reflect the characteristics of regional ethnic traditional sports tourism. In order to solve the above problems, a machine learning-based classification method for regional ethnic traditional sports tourism resources is proposed. Firstly, the relevant concepts and characteristics of traditional sports tourism resources are introduced. Then, taking the development of traditional sports of ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province as the research object, SWOT analysis, literature, interview, questionnaire, and mathematical statistics are used to investigate and analyse the overall status of the development of regional ethnic traditional sports.

The results of robust features were also compared with conventional techniques without considering the robustness of radiomic features. Methods An in-house developed lung phantom was developed with two 22mm lesion sizes based on a clinical study. A specific motor was built to simulate motion in two orthogonal directions. Lesions of both clinical and phantom studies were segmented using a Fuzzy C-means-based segmentation algorithm. After inducing motion and extracting 105 radiomic features in 4 feature sets, including shape, first-, second-, and higher-order statistics features from each region of interest (ROI) of the phantom image, statistical analyses were performed to select robust features against motion. Subsequently, these robust features and a total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from 126 clinical data. Various feature selection (FS) and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers were implemented to predict the LVI of NSCLC, followed by comparing the results of predicting LVI using robust features with common conventional techniques not considering the robustness of radiomic features. Results Our results demonstrated that selecting robust features as input to FS algorithms and ML classifiers surges the sensitivity, which has a gentle negative effect on the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) of predictions compared with commonly used methods in 12 of 15 outcomes. The top performance of the LVI prediction was achieved by the NB classifier and RFE FS without considering the robustness of radiomic features with 95% area under the curve of AUC, 67% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, the top performance of the LVI prediction using robust features belonged to the NB classifier and Boruta feature selection with 92% AUC, 86% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Conclusion Robustness over various influential factors is critical and should be considered in a radiomic study. Selecting robust features is a solution to overcome the low reproducibility of radiomic features.

However, building a Machine learning model from scratch to classify Thai cultural images can be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data. In this study, we investigate the use of transfer learning for the task of image classification on a dataset of Thai cultural images. We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration. To better understand the reasoning behind the predictions made by the models, we deployed the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique to generate heatmaps that the models attend to when making predictions.

In this study, we investigate the use of transfer learning for the task of image classification on a dataset of Thai cultural images. We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration. To better understand the reasoning behind the predictions made by the models, we deployed the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique to generate heatmaps that the models attend to when making predictions. Both our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrated that transfer learning is an effective approach to image classification on Thai cultural images.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),Unknown,Unknown,,2021,2023-12-01,"Munlika Rattaphun, Kritaphat Songsri-in","150228456, 1412969516",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0026c99e7413ead4a72b6819e15a982ce8c037fd,Computer Science,150228456,,,

Although the human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied extensively in the last few decades, the in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose estimation problems. However, the in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes with specific challenges, including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout the day and having pose distribution different from the common human surveillance viewpoint. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly reduce the effectiveness of the existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge, the infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with the unconventional pose perspective, a 2- end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. The deep learning framework proves to be the most effective model in human pose estimation; however, the lack of large public dataset for in-bed poses prevents us from using a large network from scratch. In this paper, we explored the idea of employing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-tuning the model using our own shallow (limited in size and different in perspective and color) in-bed IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-trained CNN called convolutional pose machine (CPM) was fine-tuned for in-bed pose estimation by re-training its specific intermediate layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.",IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,journal,5b1ab359-1a03-4a1b-b41d-332a3fbfd5b3,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,Unknown,7,,2016,2017-11-03,"Shuangjun Liu, Yu Yin, S.

Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.",IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,journal,5b1ab359-1a03-4a1b-b41d-332a3fbfd5b3,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,Unknown,7,,2015,2017-11-03,"Shuangjun Liu, Yu Yin, S.

Clients who want to classify their data send them to a server that performs their inference using a trained model. The client must trust the server and provide the data in plaintext. Moreover, if the classification is done at a third-party cloud service, the model owner also needs to trust the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privately evaluating decision trees. The protocol uses a novel private comparison function based on fully homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) scheme and a programmable bootstrapping technique. Our comparison function for 32-bit and 64-bit integers is 26% faster than the naive TFHE implementation. The protocol is designed to be non-interactive and is less complex than the existing interactive protocols. Our experiment results show that our technique scales linearly with the depth of the decision tree and efficiently evaluates large decision trees on real datasets.

Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are used to inform citizens about the political stances of the parties that involved in the upcoming elections, in an effort to facilitate their decision making process and increase their participation in this democratic process. VAA is a Web application that calls the users and parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, which are based on the current affairs of their country and then it recommends to each user the party that better fits their political views. SVAAs, a social recommendation approach of VAAs, on the other hand, base their recommendation on the VAA community of users in a collaborative filtering manner. In this paper we resort to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of SVAAs.

Methods A systematic search was conducted in ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts from July 2005 to May 2022. Machine learning approaches, including modified Lasso penalized regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were applied to identify hub ARGs, thereby developing a prediction model termed ARG classifier.

Subsequently, we systematically correlated the ARG classifier/hub ARGs with immunological characteristics of multiple aspects, including immune cell infiltration, immune and molecular pathways, cytokine levels, and immune-related genes. Further, we collected clinical specimens to preliminarily investigate ARG expression levels and to assess the diagnostic performance of ARG classifier. Results A total of ten GEO and three ArrayExpress datasets were included in this study. Based on machine learning algorithms, eight key ARGs (ATG4C, BAX, BIRC5, ERBB2, FKBP1B, HIF1A, NCKAP1, and NFKB1) were integrated to establish ARG classifier. The model exhibited excellent diagnostic values (AUC > 0.85) in multiple datasets and multiple points in time and superiorly distinguished sepsis from other critical illnesses.

Finally, using clinical specimens, the expression levels of key ARGs in patients with sepsis were found to differ significantly from those of control patients, and ARG classifier exhibited superior diagnostic performance, compared to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein.

Previous studies have shown that endorsing conspiracy beliefs leads to lower protective guideline adherence (i.e., wearing face masks), posing a threat to public health measures. The current study expands this research across the lifespan, i.e., in a sample of adolescents with mental health problems. Here, we investigated the association between conspiracy beliefs and guideline adherence while also exploring the predictors of conspiracy beliefs. Methods N  = 93 adolescent psychiatric outpatients (57% female, mean age: 15.8) were assessed using anonymous paper–pencil questionnaires. Endorsement of generic and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was assessed, in addition to items measuring adherence to protective guidelines and mental health (stress, depressive symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and adverse childhood experiences). Multiple regressions and supervised machine learning (conditional random forests) were used for analyses. Results Fourteen percent of our sample fully endorsed at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory, while protective guidelines adherence was relatively high ( M  = 4.92, on a scale from 1 to 7). The endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs—but not of generic conspiracy beliefs—was associated with lower guideline adherence (β = − 0.32, 95% CI − 0.53 to − 0.11, p  < .001). Conditional random forests suggested that adverse childhood experiences and peer and conduct problems were relevant predictors of both conspiracy belief categories.

As such, synthetic signals possess known ground truth labels of the underlying disease and can be employed for validation of machine learning ECG analysis tools in addition to clinical signals. Recently, synthetic ECGs were used to enrich sparse clinical data or even replace them completely during training leading to improved performance on real-world clinical test data. We thus generated a novel synthetic database comprising a total of 16,900 12 lead ECGs based on electrophysiological simulations equally distributed into healthy control and 7 pathology classes.

As such, synthetic signals possess known ground truth labels of the underlying disease and can be employed for validation of machine learning ECG analysis tools in addition to clinical signals. Recently, synthetic ECGs were used to enrich sparse clinical data or even replace them completely during training leading to improved performance on real-world clinical test data. We thus generated a novel synthetic database comprising a total of 16,900 12 lead ECGs based on electrophysiological simulations equally distributed into healthy control and 7 pathology classes.

However finding effective solution to these problems has been rendered difficult. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents an analytical Machine learning model that suitably combined the graph signature with random forest techniques. This study presents the design and realization of a novel Intelligent Citizenship Identity through family pedigree using Graph Signature based random forest (GSB-RF) model. The study also showcases the development of a novel graph signature technique referred to as Canonical Code Signature(CCS) method. The CCS method is used at the pre-processing stage of the identification process to build signature for any given tuple. Performance comparisim between the present system and the baseline techniques which includes: the K-Nearest Neighbour and the traditional Random Forest shows that the present system outperformed the baseline method studied. The proposed system shows capability to perform continuous re-identification of Citizens based on their family pedigree with ability to select best sample with low computational complexity, high identification accuracy and speed. Our experimental result shows that the precision rate and identification quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%.

This study suggests that the new proposed algorithm using quantum computing might be a good choice among the causal discovery algorithms in the low-data regime for novel medical knowledge discovery.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLOS ONE,Unknown,18,,2019,2021-10-09,H.

Methods After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. Results This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm explains the individualized predictions.

It creates an adverse impact on flyrock. Thus, it is essential to forecast flyrock to minimize the environmental effects. The objective of this study is to forecast/estimate the amount of flyrock produced during blasting by applying three creative composite intelligent models: equilibrium optimizer-coupled extreme learning machine (EO-ELM), particle swarm optimization-based extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). To obtain a successful conclusion, we considered 114 blasting data parameters consisting of eight inputs (hole diameter, burden, stemming length, rock density, charge-per-meter, powder factor (PF), blastability index (BI), and weathering index), and one output parameter (flyrock distance). We then compared the results of different models using seven different performance indices. Every predictive model accomplished the results comparable with the measured values of flyrock. To show the effectiveness of the developed EO-ELM, the result from each model run 10-times is compared. The average result shows that the EO-ELM model in testing (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 32.14, MAE = 19.78, MAPE = 20.37, NSE = 0.93, VAF = 93.97, A20 = 0.57) achieved a better performance as compared to the PSO-ANN model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 64.44, MAE = 36.02, MAPE = 29.96, NSE = 0.72, VAF = 74.72, A20 = 0.33) and PSO-ELM model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 48.55, MAE = 26.97, MAPE = 26.71, NSE = 0.84, VAF = 84.84, A20 = 0.51). Further, a non-parametric test is performed to assess the performance of these three models developed.

We present outcome (‘recovered’, ‘isolated’ or ‘death’) risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over ‘early’ datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used ‘country’, ‘age’ and ‘gender’ as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient’s ‘disease’ history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results The use of a patient’s ‘disease’ history improves the prediction of ‘death’ by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent’s ‘disease’ history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient’s ‘disease’ history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions.

EEMD is applied to preprocess NAO index data, which are issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NAO index data are decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). After being filtered by the energy threshold, the remaining IMFs are used to reconstruct new NAO index data as the input of ConvLSTM.

To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit.

To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit. In comparison with other similar types of models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF), the classification accuracy of JMLA is 97.9% on the train set. The accuracy rate on the test set reached 97.6%.

The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs’ chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes.

The emergence and/or worsening of chronic pain are known sequelae of IPV; however, not all those who experience IPV develop chronic pain. To mitigate its development, it is critical to identify the factors that are associated with increased risk of pain after IPV. This proof-of-concept study used machine-learning strategies to predict pain severity and interference in 47 young women, ages 18 to 30, who experienced an incident of IPV (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) within three months of their baseline assessment. Young women are more likely than men to experience IPV and to subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Women completed a comprehensive assessment of theory-driven cognitive and neurobiological predictors of pain severity and pain-related interference (e.g., pain, coping, disability, psychiatric diagnosis/symptoms, PTSD/trauma, executive function, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress response). Gradient boosting machine models were used to predict symptoms of pain severity and pain-related interference across time (Baseline, 1-,3-,6- follow-up assessments). Models showed excellent predictive performance for pain severity and adequate predictive performance for pain-related interference. This proof-of-concept study suggests that machine-learning approaches are a useful tool for identifying predictors of pain development in survivors of recent IPV. Baseline measures of pain, family life impairment, neuropsychological function, and trauma history were of greatest importance in predicting pain and pain-related interference across a 6-month follow-up period. Present findings support the use of machine-learning techniques in larger studies of post-IPV pain development and highlight theory-driven predictors that could inform the development of targeted early intervention programs. However, these results should be replicated in a larger dataset with lower levels of missing data.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,16,,2020,2021-07-29,"E.

Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14 months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000 cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.",Veterinary Medicine International,journal,e9256dd3-be3a-4cc1-8c58-f046aea49466,Veterinary Medicine International,Unknown,2025,,2024,2025-01-01,"R.

The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.",Veterinary Medicine International,journal,e9256dd3-be3a-4cc1-8c58-f046aea49466,Veterinary Medicine International,Unknown,2025,,2023,2025-01-01,"R.

However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume.

This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiome in the onset and progression of cancer, as well as in response to chemo-immunotherapy. Recent findings regarding the tumor microbiome and its implications for clinical practice are also commented on. Current microbiome-based intervention strategies (i.e., prebiotics, probiotics, live biotherapeutics and fecal microbiota transplantation) are then discussed, along with key shortcomings, including a lack of long-term safety information in patients who are already severely compromised by standard treatments. The implementation of bioinformatic tools applied to microbiomics and other omics data, such as machine learning, has an enormous potential to push research in the field, enabling the prediction of health risk and therapeutic outcomes, for a truly personalized precision medicine.",Current Medicinal Chemistry,journal,4dbfe6f0-742b-4e3f-a64b-80278552db0d,Current medicinal chemistry,Unknown,Unknown,,2020,2022-01-05,"F.

The genetic association signals between 5-HTTLPR and psychiatric phenotypes, however, have been inconsistent across many studies. Since the polymorphism cannot be tested via available SNP arrays, we had previously proposed an efficient machine learning algorithm to predict the genotypes of 5-HTTLPR based on the genotypes of eight nearby SNPs, which requires access to individual-level genotype and phenotype data. To utilize the advantage of publicly available GWAS summary statistics obtained from studies with very large sample sizes, we develop a GWAS summary-statistics-based approach for testing the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) associations with various phenotypes. We first cross-verify the accuracy of the summary-statistics-based approach for 61 phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Since we observed a strong similarity between the predicted individual-level 5-HTTLPR genotype-based approach and the summary-statistics-based approach, we applied our method to the available neurobehavioral GWAS summary statistics data obtained from large-scale GWAS. We found no genome-wide significant evidence for association between 5-HTTLPR and any of the neurobehavioral traits. We did observe, however, genome-wide significant evidence for association between this locus and human adult height, BMI, and total cholesterol.

The Jucazinho Dam, built in 1998, emerged as a response to the scarcity of water in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil. After having less than 1% of its water storage capacity in 2016, the dam recovered in 2020 after interventions by the local water utility. In this context, the reliability of influent flow prediction models for dams becomes crucial for managers. This study proposed hydrological models based on artificial intelligence that aim to generate flow series, and we evaluated the adaptability of these models for the operation of the Jucazinho Dam. Data normalization between 0 and 1 was applied to avoid the predominance of variables with high values. The model was based on machine learning and employed support vector regression (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), as provided by the Python Sklearn library. The selection of the monitoring stations took place via the Brazilian National Water and Sanitation Agency’s (ANA) HIDROWEB portal, and we used Spearman’s correlation to identify the relationship between precipitation and flow. The evaluation of the performance of the model involved graphical analyses and statistical criteria such as the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the percentage of bias (PBIAS), the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean standard deviation ratio (RSR). The results of the statistical coefficients for the test data indicated unsatisfactory performance for long-term predictions (8, 16 and 32 days ahead), revealing a downward trend in the quality of the fit with an increase in the forecast horizon. The SVM model stood out by obtaining the best indices of NSE, PBIAS, R2 and RSR. The graphical results of the SVM models showed underestimation of the flow values with an increase in the forecast horizon due to the sensitivity of the SVM to complex patterns in the time series. On the other hand, the RF and ANN models showed hyperestimation of the flow values as the number of forecast days increased, which was mainly attributed to overfitting. In summary, this study highlights the relevance of artificial intelligence in flow prediction for the efficient management of dams, especially in water scarcity and data-scarce scenarios.

The instruments used so far for dietary monitoring (eg, food frequency questionnaires, food diaries, and telephone interviews) are inexpensive and easy to implement but show important inaccuracies. Alternative methods based on wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated from these types of devices. Objective This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable estimate of caloric intake. Methods The study will capture four individual eating activities outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email, flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the University of Padova. Results The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high accuracy. Conclusions Building an automatic calculation method for caloric intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg, for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different segments of the population.

Despite the growing knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction and ulcerative colitis (UC), the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in UC remains to be fully explored. Methods We integrated 1137 UC colon mucosal samples from 12 multicenter cohorts worldwide to create a normalized compendium. Differentially expressed mitochondria-related genes (DE-MiRGs) in individuals with UC were identified using the “Limma” R package. Unsupervised consensus clustering was utilized to determine the intrinsic subtypes of UC driven by DE-MiRGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to investigate module genes related to UC. Four machine learning algorithms were utilized for screening DE-MiRGs in UC and construct MiRGs diagnostic models. The models were developed utilizing the over-sampled training cohort, followed by validation in both the internal test cohort and the external validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Xcell and CIBERSORT algorithms, while potential biological mechanisms were explored through GSVA and GSEA algorithms. Hub genes were selected using the PPI network. Results The study identified 108 DE-MiRGs in the colonic mucosa of patients with UC compared to healthy controls, showing significant enrichment in pathways associated with mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation. The MiRGs diagnostic models for UC were constructed based on 17 signature genes identified through various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities. Utilizing the identified DE-MiRGs from the normalized compendium, 941 patients with UC were stratified into three subtypes characterized by distinct cellular and molecular profiles. Specifically, the metabolic subtype demonstrated enrichment in epithelial cells, the immune-inflamed subtype displayed high enrichment in antigen-presenting cells and pathways related to pro-inflammatory activation, and the transitional subtype exhibited moderate activation across all signaling pathways. Importantly, the immune-inflamed subtype exhibited a stronger correlation with superior response to four biologics: infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and golimumab compared to the metabolic subtype. Conclusion This analysis unveils the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune microenvironment in UC, thereby offering novel perspectives on the potential pathogenesis of UC and precision treatment of UC patients, and identifying new therapeutic targets.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,Unknown,15,,2023,2024-07-04,"Yi-fan Zhang, Meng-ying Fan, Qi-rui Bai, Rong Zhao, Shan Song, Li Wu, Jun-hui Lu, Jing-wei Liu, Qi Wang, Yuan Li, Xing Chen","2270958682, 2309982371, 2310040392, 2266167149, 2310320981, 2161944199, 2310188122, 2309962147, 2310246652, 2310440004, 2271219376",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e31ab99c90e5720ecd5fd6d74e672b887876c,"Biology, Environmental Science, Medicine",2270958682,,,

This study aims to further enhance the capabilities of ridge and Liu estimators within the ELM framework by introducing two innovative two-parameter algorithms (TP1-ELM and TP2-ELM) that simultaneously incorporate both estimators. The proposed algorithms undergo comprehensive benchmarking against ELM, ELM-based algorithms, and other commonly used machine learning techniques across seven diverse datasets. Benchmark results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform both ELM-focused approaches and traditional machine learning algorithms on most datasets, yielding more generalizable and stable results.

Currently, no specific clinical decision rules are available for OAT patients. The aim of the study was to identify which clinical risk factors easily identifiable at first ED evaluation may be associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in OAT patients who suffered an MTBI. Methods Three thousand fifty-four patients in OAT with MTBI from four Italian centers were retrospectively considered. A decision tree analysis using the classification and regression tree (CART) method was conducted to evaluate both the pre- and post-traumatic clinical risk factors most associated with the presence of post-traumatic ICH after MTBI and their possible role in determining the patient’s risk. The decision tree analysis used all clinical risk factors identified at the first ED evaluation as input predictor variables. Results ICH following MTBI was present in 9.5% of patients (290/3054). The CART model created a decision tree using 5 risk factors, post-traumatic amnesia, post-traumatic transitory loss of consciousness, greater trauma dynamic, GCS less than 15, evidence of trauma above the clavicles, capable of stratifying patients into different increasing levels of ICH risk (from 2.5 to 61.4%). The absence of concussion and neurological alteration at admission appears to significantly reduce the possible presence of ICH.

In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking ‘big’ by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking ‘deep’ by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that ‘business travel’, which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,60447-60458,9,,2020,,"N.

However, managing optimal power generation for solar power plants has its own challenges. First comes the problem of work interruption and reduction in power generation. As the system must be tolerant to the faults, the relevance and significance of short-term forecasting of solar power generation becomes crucial. Within the framework of this research, the applicability of different forecasting methods for short-time forecasting is explained. The main goal of the research is to show an approach regarding how to make the forecast more accurate and overcome the above-mentioned challenges using opensource data as features. The data clustering algorithm based on KMeans is proposed to train unique models for specific groups of data samples to improve the generation forecast accuracy. Based on practical calculations, machine learning models based on Random Forest algorithm are selected which have been proven to have higher efficiency in predicting the generation of solar power plants. The proposed algorithm was successfully tested in practice, with an achieved accuracy near to 90%.",Algorithms,journal,e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,419,17,,2023,2024-09-20,"Kristina I.

However, managing optimal power generation for solar power plants has its own challenges. First comes the problem of work interruption and reduction in power generation. As the system must be tolerant to the faults, the relevance and significance of short-term forecasting of solar power generation becomes crucial. Within the framework of this research, the applicability of different forecasting methods for short-time forecasting is explained. The main goal of the research is to show an approach regarding how to make the forecast more accurate and overcome the above-mentioned challenges using opensource data as features. The data clustering algorithm based on KMeans is proposed to train unique models for specific groups of data samples to improve the generation forecast accuracy. Based on practical calculations, machine learning models based on Random Forest algorithm are selected which have been proven to have higher efficiency in predicting the generation of solar power plants. The proposed algorithm was successfully tested in practice, with an achieved accuracy near to 90%.",Algorithms,journal,e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,419,17,,2022,2024-09-20,"Kristina I.

Diagnostic errors are an underappreciated cause of preventable mortality in hospitals and pose a risk for severe patient harm and increase hospital length of stay.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to explore the potential of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in improving diagnostic safety surveillance. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of the feasibility and potential to use electronic health records clinical notes and existing case review data.


METHODS
Safety Learning System case review data from 1 large health system composed of 10 hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from February 2016 to September 2021 were analyzed. The case review outcome included opportunities for improvement including diagnostic opportunities for improvement. To supplement case review data, electronic health record clinical notes were extracted and analyzed. A simple logistic regression model along with 3 forms of logistic regression models (ie, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Ridge, and Elastic Net) with regularization functions was trained on this data to compare classification performances in classifying patients who experienced diagnostic errors during hospitalization. Further, statistical tests were conducted to find significant differences between female and male patients who experienced diagnostic errors.


RESULTS
In total, 126 (7.4%) patients (of 1704) had been identified by case reviewers as having experienced at least 1 diagnostic error. Patients who had experienced diagnostic error were grouped by sex: 59 (7.1%) of the 830 women and 67 (7.7%) of the 874 men. Among the patients who experienced a diagnostic error, female patients were older (median 72, IQR 66-80 vs median 67, IQR 57-76; P=.02), had higher rates of being admitted through general or internal medicine (69.5% vs 47.8%; P=.01), lower rates of cardiovascular-related admitted diagnosis (11.9% vs 28.4%; P=.02), and lower rates of being admitted through neurology department (2.3% vs 13.4%; P=.04). The Ridge model achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.885), specificity (0.797), positive predictive value (PPV; 0.24), and F1-score (0.369) in classifying patients who were at higher risk of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT. Materials and Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I–II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors. Results Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794–0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873–0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789–0.915), respectively.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors.

Although there are differences between insomnia and SD, they have similar symptoms and the same animal model. Currently, there is a lack of microarray data on insomnia. Therefore, for now, we are going to apply the SD data to insomnia. Although many studies have explained the possible mechanisms associated with insomnia, no previous studies have considered the key genes associated with insomnia or the relationship between insomnia and immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between key genes and immune cells by identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of insomnia. Next, we verified the efficacy of these biomarkers experimentally. Methods First, we downloaded four microarrays (GSE11755, GSE12624, GSE28750, and GSE48080) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 239 normal human blood samples and 365 blood specimens from patients with SD. Then, we analyzed two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model to investigate these key genes. Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not.

Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,PLOS Computational Biology,Unknown,19,,2020,2022-08-24,"C.

With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding. Methods The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit ≥ 18 years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features ( n  = 88) were selected with clinicians’ input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in > 0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. Results There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632–0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs.

The method for developing recommendations based on collaborative filtering such as Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and hybrid methods of Machine Learning (ML) has been improved. The paper describes the design principles and functional requirements to a recommendation system in the form of a Web application for choosing the content required by user using movies as an example. The research has focused on solving issues related to cold start and scalability within the method of collaborative filtering. To effectively address these tasks, we have used hybrid training methods. A hybrid recommendation system (HRS) has been practically implemented for providing relevant content recommendations using movies as an example, taking into consideration the user's personal preferences based on the constructed hybrid method. We have improved an algorithm for developing content recommendations based on the collaborative filtering and Machine Learning for the combined filtration of similarity indicators among users or goods. The hybrid algorithm receives initial information in a different form, normalizes it, and generates relevant recommendations based on a combination of CF and CBF methods. Machine Learning is capable of defining those factors that influence the selection of relevant films, which improves development of recommendations specific to the user. To solve these tasks, a new improved method has been proposed, underlying which, in contrast to existing systems of recommendations, are the hybrid methods and Machine Learning. Machine Learning data for the designed HRS were borrowed from MovieLens. We have analyzed methods for developing recommendations to the user; existing recommendation systems have been reviewed. Our experimental results demonstrate that the operational indicators for the proposed HRS, based on the technology of CF+CBF+ML, outperform those for two individual models, CF and CBF, and such their combinations as CF CBF, CF+ML, and CBF+ML.

Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2 mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively.

The explanation of the model output based on SHAP values can provide a reference basis for medical physicists when adjusting the plan, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of treatment plans.Conclusion: It is feasible to use a machine learning method based on radiomics to establish a gamma pass rate classification prediction model for IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvis. The XGBoost model performs better in classification than the other three tree-based ensemble models, and global explanations and single-sample explanations of the model output through SHAP values may offer reference for medical physicists to provide high-quality plans, promoting the clinical application and implementation of GPR prediction models, and providing safe and efficient personalized QA management for patients.",Frontiers of Physics,journal,f0455aa5-b1f5-47b0-afdb-accda588a9c4,Frontiers in Physics,Unknown,Unknown,,2022,2023-08-10,"Q.

Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. Methods The multi-institutional PHIS+ clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children’s hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Results Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity .

We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), and high (0.5 < z < 1.0). By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for ∼60%–70% of the host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of ∼80%–95%, depending on the redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve a disk precision of 96%/82%/79% and bulge precision of 90%/90%/80% (for the three redshift bins) at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of 30%/43%/42%. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging surveys.",Astrophysical Journal,journal,7652ece8-fbd3-4050-b927-cf29d7f0eaa8,The Astrophysical Journal,Unknown,944,,2021,2022-12-20,"Chuan Tian, C.

This work presents a method to project the data from some discrete sensory locations to the overall reactor domain during conduction cooldown scenarios similar to High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). The existing models for conductive cooldown in a heterogeneous multi-body system, such as an assembly of prismatic blocks or pebble beds relies on knowledge of the thermal contact conductance, requiring significant knowledge of local thermal contacts and heat transport possibilities across those contacts. With a priori knowledge of bulk geometry features and some discrete sensors, a machine learning approach was devised. The presented work uses an experimental facility to mimic conduction cooldown with an assembly of 68 cylindrical rods initially heated to 1200 K. High-fidelity temperature data were collected using an infrared (IR) camera to provide training data to the model and validate the predicted temperature data. The machine learning approach used here first converts the macroscopic bulk geometry information into Graph-Laplacian, and then uses the eigenvectors of the Graph-Laplacian to develop Kernel functions. Support vector regression (SVR) was implemented on the obtained Kernels and used to predict the thermal response in a packed rod assembly during a conduction cooldown experiment. The usage of SVR modeling differs from most models today because of its representation of thermal coupling between rods in the core. When trained with thermographic data, the average normalized error is less than 2% over 400 s, during which temperatures of the assembly have dropped by more than 500 K. The rod temperature prediction performance was significantly better for rods in the interior of the assembly compared to those near the exterior, likely due to the model simplification of the surroundings.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,Unknown,Unknown,,2021,2022-05-25,"M.

This paper examines the trends in household charging sessions’ timing, duration, and energy consumption by analyzing real-world residential charging data. By leveraging the information collected from each session, a novel framework is introduced for the efficient, real-time prediction of important charging characteristics. Utilizing historical data and user-specific features, machine learning models are trained to predict the connection duration, charging duration, charging demand, and time until the next session. These models enhance the understanding of EV users’ behavior and provide practical tools for optimizing the EV charging infrastructure and effectively managing the charging demand.

Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” (PAI) reflecting an individual’s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

A potential route to accelerate this process is to employ artificial intelligence methodologies such as machine learning (ML). Herein, the possibility to predict anti‐inflammatory properties of the polymers by using a simplified model of inflammation and a restrained dataset is explored. Cellular assays with 50 different polymers are conducted using the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. These experiments generate a dataset which is used to develop a ML model based on Bayesian logistic regression. After conducting a Bayesian logistic regression analysis, two ML models, K‐nearest neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes, are employed to predict anti‐inflammatory polymers properties. The study finds that the probability of a polymer having anti‐inflammatory properties is multiplied by three if it is a polycation, and that nitric oxide secretion is a good indicator in determining the anti‐inflammatory properties of a polymer, which in this work are defined by tumor necrosis factor alpha expression decrease. Overall, the study suggests that with appropriate dataset design, ML techniques can provide valuable information on functional polymer properties, enabling faster and more efficient biomaterial development.",Advanced NanoBiomed Research,journal,7ba839a3-edbb-4dd0-b241-fd1020910706,Advanced NanoBiomed Research,Unknown,Unknown,,2024,2024-01-08,"Aghilas Akkache, Lisa Clavier, Oleh Mezhenskyi, Kateryna Andriienkova, Thibaut Soubrié, Philippe Lavalle, N.

GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high TUBA1B expression is closely associated with glioma malignancy and poor prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target.",Frontiers in Oncology,journal,fdeb07d1-a046-4a1a-98aa-167e7f8e667a,Frontiers in Oncology,Unknown,15,,2025,2025-02-28,"Zesheng Sun, Pengcheng Huang, Jialiang Lin, Guiping Jiang, Jian Chen, Qianqian Liu","2335088745, 2348080160, 2335146575, 2349229052, 2348215666, 2348012936",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d0ebfeb82a9c0fe964bd5ca0811f352883cf,"Biology, Medicine",2335088745,['JournalArticle'],0.0,42.0

Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 203 patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI before prostate biopsy were included. After manual segmentation, radiomic features (RFs) were extracted from T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, and high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI). Patients were split into training sets and testing sets according to a ratio of 8:2. A pipeline considering combinations of two feature selection (FS) methods and six ML classifiers was developed and evaluated. The performance of models was assessed using the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1-measure, and the area under curve (AUC). Results: On high b-value DWMRI-derived features, a combination of FS method recursive feature elimination (RFE) and classifier random forest achieved the highest performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs, with 97.0% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity, 98.0% precision, and 97.0% F1-measure. The method also achieved an average AUC for GG of 98%. Conclusion: Preoperative mpMRI radiomic analysis based on ML, as a noninvasive approach, showed good performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs. Advances in Knowledge: Herein, radiomic models based on preoperative mpMRI and ML were developed to classify prostate cancer into 5 GGs.

Methods The original tweets posted on Weibo between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, containing the words “aging” or “old age” were extracted. A bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT)-based model was used to generate themes related to this perception. A qualitative thematic analysis and an independent review of the theme labels were conducted by the researchers. Results The findings indicate that public perceptions revolved around four themes: (1) health prevention and protection, (2) convenient living environments, (3) cognitive health and social integration, and (4) protecting the rights and interests of the older adult.

This study aims to ascertain differences in the importance features of machine learning models of household disaster preparedness for four groups to inform culturally tailored intervention recommendations for nursing practice. A machine learning model was developed and tested by combining data from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Federal Emergency Management Agency National Household Survey. The primary outcome variable was a composite readiness score. A total of 252 variables from 15,048 participants were included. Over 10% of the sample self-identified as African American/Black and 30.3% reported being 65 years of age or older. Importance features varied regarding financial and insurance preparedness, information seeking and transportation between groups. These results reiterate the need for targeted interventions to support financial resilience and equitable resource access. Notably, older adults with Black racial identities were the only group where TV, TV news, and the Weather Channel was a priority feature for household disaster preparedness.

Specifically, if common variants confer growth advantages, they may have undergone positive selection across different patients due to similar selection pressures. Moreover, studies have demonstrated the significance of rare mutations that arise as resistance mechanisms in response to drug treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of both recurrent and rare variants in cancer. In addition to this, most existing tools for variant prediction focus on distinguishing variants found in normal and disease populations, often without considering the specific disease contexts in which these variants arise. Instead, they typically build predictors that generalise across all diseases. Here, we introduce CanDrivR-CS, a set of cancer-specific gradient boosting models designed to distinguish between rare and recurrent cancer variants. Results We curated missense variant data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Cancer-type-specific models significantly outperformed a baseline pan-cancer model, achieving a maximum leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) F1 score of up to 90% for CanDrivRSKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma) and 89% for CanDrivR-SKCA (Skin Adenocarcinoma), compared to 79.2% for the baseline model. Notably, DNA shape properties consistently ranked among the top features for distinguishing recurrent and rare variants across all cancers. Specifically, recurrent missense variants frequently occurred in DNA bends and rolls, potentially implicating regions prone to DNA replication errors and acting as mutational hotspots.

It is very important to establish an accurate prediction model of cyanobacterial bloom concentration, which is a challenging issue. Machine learning techniques can improve the prediction accuracy, but a large amount of historical monitoring data is needed to train these models. For some waters with an inconvenient geographical location or frequent sensor failures, there are not enough historical data to train the model. To deal with this problem, a fused model based on a transfer learning method is proposed in this paper. In this study, the data of water environment with a large amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the source domain in order to learn the knowledge of cyanobacterial bloom growth characteristics and train the prediction model. The data of the water environment with a small amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the target domain in order to load the model trained in the source domain. Then, the training set of the target domain is used to participate in the inter-layer fine-tuning training of the model to obtain the transfer learning model. At last, the transfer learning model is fused with a convolutional neural network to obtain the prediction model. Various experiments are conducted for a 2 h prediction on the test set of the target domain. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of cyanobacterial blooms for the water environment with a low data volume.",Water,journal,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,Unknown,Unknown,,2022,2022-04-16,"J.

Previous studies have targeted particular patient populations with life-limiting disease, but few have focused on patients in a primary care setting. Toward this end, we propose a stepped-wedge pragmatic randomized trial whereby a machine learning algorithm identifies patients empaneled to primary care units at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, United States) with high likelihood of palliative care need. Methods 42 care team units in 9 clusters were randomized to 7 wedges, each lasting 42 days. For care teams in treatment wedges, palliative care specialists review identified patients, making recommendations to primary care providers when appropriate. Care teams in control wedges receive palliative care under the standard of care. Discussion This pragmatic trial therefore integrates machine learning into clinical decision making, instead of simply reporting theoretical predictive performance. Such integration has the possibility to decrease time to palliative care, improving patient quality of life and symptom burden.

High levels and complex patterns of spontaneous activity are generally associated with low rates of apoptosis in the cortex. However, whether spontaneous activity patterns directly encode for survival of individual cortical neurons during development remains an open question. Here, we longitudinally investigated spontaneous activity and apoptosis in developing cortical cultures, combining extracellular electrophysiology with calcium imaging. These experiments demonstrated that the early occurrence of calcium transients was strongly linked to neuronal survival. Silent neurons exhibited a higher probability of cell death, whereas high frequency spiking and burst behavior were almost exclusively detected in surviving neurons. In local neuronal clusters, activity of neighboring neurons exerted a pro-survival effect, whereas on the functional level, networks with a high modular topology were associated with lower cell death rates. Using machine learning algorithms, cell fate of individual neurons was predictable through the integration of spontaneous activity features. Our results indicate that high frequency spiking activity constrains apoptosis in single neurons through sustained calcium rises and thereby consolidates networks in which a high modular topology is reached during early development.",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,journal,5b97da83-0106-4e9f-aef2-4c3006afbb2c,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,Unknown,10,,2022,2022-08-10,"David Warm, Davide Bassetti, Jonas Schroer, H.

This is especially true when these DTs are paired with real-time simulation models that make use of modern technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. These combinations can provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of the monitored systems. Digital twin (DT) has shown tremendous potential to bring about revolutionary improvements in the field of construction site surveillance. There is, however, a notable paucity of empirical research identifying the constant elements affecting DT adoption in this industry. This research tries to fill that void by identifying the important elements that determine the usage of DT in construction. The study adopts a complete framework with the goal of increasing the use of DT in building site monitoring. The elements influencing the adoption and effectiveness of distributed ledger technology (DT) are divided into three categories: technological, organizational, and economic. Technological factors include the system's appropriateness and the robustness of the data infrastructure. Organizational considerations include the company's openness to innovation and leadership support. Economic aspects include things like return on investment (ROI) and cost-effectiveness. The research technique combines case studies and literature reviews to examine the benefits and drawbacks of DT in construction monitoring. This study's expected output is a comprehensive framework that aids construction businesses in optimizing the use of DT in site monitoring. This would allow for more efficient, data-driven, and forward-thinking processes. The study's ultimate purpose is to provide critical knowledge that will assist the building sector in adopting cutting-edge methods. The industry may better plan for the integration of this sophisticated technology into their operations by knowing the potential of DT and the variables driving its adoption.

However, many current studies overlook the relationships between different growth parameters and their varying contributions to yield, leading to overlapping information and lower accuracy in monitoring crop growth. Therefore, this study focuses on winter wheat and constructs a comprehensive growth monitoring index (CGIac), based on adaptive weight allocation of growth parameters’ contribution to yield, using data such as leaf area index (LAI), soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, plant height (PH), biomass (BM), and plant water content (PWC). Using UAV data on vegetation indices, feature selection was performed using the Elastic Net. The growth inversion model was then constructed using machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector regression (SVR). Based on the optimal growth inversion model for winter wheat, spatial distribution of wheat growth in the study area is obtained. The findings demonstrated that CGIac outperforms CGIav (constructed using equal weighting) and CGIcv (built using the coefficient of variation) in yield correlation and prediction accuracy. Specifically, the yield correlation of CGIac improved by up to 0.76 compared to individual indices, while yield prediction accuracy increased by up to 23.14%. Among the evaluated models, the RF model achieved the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.895 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0058. A comparison with wheat orthophotos from the same period confirmed that the inversion results were highly consistent with actual growth conditions in the study area. The proposed method significantly improved the accuracy and applicability of winter wheat growth monitoring, overcoming the limitations of single parameters in growth prediction. Additionally, it provided new technological support and innovative solutions for regional crop monitoring and precision farming operations.",Agriculture,journal,182090fa-e886-41f3-8590-443a006fb02f,Agriculture,Unknown,Unknown,,2024,2024-10-26,"Lulu Zhang, Xiaowen Wang, Huanhuan Zhang, Bo Zhang, Jin Zhang, Xinkang Hu, Xintong Du, Jianrong Cai, Weidong Jia, Chundu Wu","2328457063, 2181382810, 2328271931, 2295873742, 2328099286, 2328219368, 2328800883, 2329139801, 2319523838, 2267774398",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005a412ddf59452f7c58c49b6060a62d0bba0f1,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Engineering, Environmental Science",2328457063,['JournalArticle'],0.0,0.0

In this work reactions are labeled with experimental conditions and network analysis shows that consistencies within clusters of data points can be leveraged to organize this information. In particular, this analysis shows how particular experimental conditions (specifically solvent) are effective in enabling specific organic reactions (Friedel-Crafts, Aldol addition, Claisen condensation, Diels-Alder, and Wittig), including variations within each reaction class. An example of network analysis is shown in the graphical abstract, where data points for a Claisen condensation reaction break into clusters that depend on the catalyst and chemical structure. This type of clustering, which mimics how a chemist reasons, is derived directly from the network. Therefore the findings of this work could augment synthesis planning by providing predictions in a fashion that mimics human chemists. To numerically evaluate solvent prediction ability, three methods are compared: network analysis (through the k-nearest neighbor algorithm), a support vector machine, and a deep neural network. The most accurate method in 4 of the 5 test cases is the network analysis, with deep neural networks also showing good prediction scores. The network analysis tool was evaluated by an expert panel of chemists, who generally agreed that the algorithm produced accurate solvent choices while simultaneously being transparent in the underlying reasons for its predictions.",Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,journal,3f16aef5-6b9f-4f87-baca-cbf8147e352f,Journal of chemical information and modeling,Unknown,Unknown,,2019,2019-08-05,"E.

The results on two datasets, training set and independent test set, show that this proposed method yields significantly better prediction accuracy. In addition, we also demonstrate the predictive power of our proposed method by modeling the cancer cell sensitivity to two natural products, Curcumin and Resveratrol, which indicate that our method can effectively predict the response of cancer cell lines to these two natural products.

This scheduling problem involves strategically managing the limited stored hydro energy in coordination with the electricity system. The scenario fan problem, selected as a long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling approach, can effectively represent the individual hydropower plants and their short‐term flexibility within the long‐term scheduling process, making it well‐suited for capturing the disaggregated physical characteristics of hydro stations. However, the computational burden of scenario fan problem increases due to the complexity of the cascaded system and the large number of inflow scenarios. To tackle these challenges, a machine learning clustering method is developed for extracting shape‐based features to capture the energy and shape attributes of hydro inflows. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing it with four established clustering methods. This evaluation was carried out on a hydro‐thermal test case, utilizing both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample data analysis. The findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other methods in terms of computational time by 42.6% and optimal reservoir trajectories by 12.1% considering K‐means using Euclidean distance as the benchmark. Additionally, this study showcases the feasibility of performing long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling at a granular level, with detailed topological information and a shorter time scale.

The crucial role of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) gene family in the tumor microenvironment of HCC remains unclear. Methods This study employed a novel multi-omics integration strategy to investigate the potential roles of ADAM family signals in HCC. A series of single-cell and spatial omics algorithms were utilized to uncover the molecular characteristics of ADAM family genes within HCC. The GSVA package was utilized to compute the scores for ADAM family signals, subsequently stratified into three categories: high, medium, and low ADAM signal levels through unsupervised clustering. Furthermore, we developed and rigorously validated an innovative and robust clinical prognosis assessment model by employing 99 mainstream machine learning algorithms in conjunction with co-expression feature spectra of ADAM family genes. To validate our findings, we conducted PCR and IHC experiments to confirm differential expression patterns within the ADAM family genes. Results Gene signals from the ADAM family were notably abundant in endothelial cells, liver cells, and monocyte macrophages. Single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analyses have both revealed the molecular heterogeneity of the ADAM gene family, further emphasizing its significant impact on the development and progression of HCC. In HCC tissues, the expression levels of ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 were markedly elevated. Elevated ADAM family signal scores were linked to adverse clinical outcomes and disruptions in the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming. An ADAM prognosis signal, developed through the utilization of 99 machine learning algorithms, could accurately forecast the survival duration of HCC, achieving an AUC value of approximately 0.9.

A comprehensive but practical test battery using 5 wearable inertial sensors for multifactorial fall risk assessment was designed. This was followed by an experimental study on 196 community-dwelling Korean older women, categorized as fallers (N1 = 82) and non-fallers (N2 = 114) based on prior history of falls. Six machine learning models (logistic regression, naïve bayes, decision tree, random forest, boosted tree and support vector machine) were proposed for faller classification. Results indicated that compared with non-fallers, fallers performed significantly worse on the test battery. In addition, the application of sensor data and support vector machine for faller classification achieved an overall accuracy of 89.4% with 92.7% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity. These findings suggest that wearable inertial sensor based systems show promise for elderly fall risk assessment, which could be implemented in clinical practice to identify “at-risk” individuals reliably to promote proactive fall prevention.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,Unknown,8,,2018,2018-11-05,"Hai Qiu, R.

In particular, toddler’s unique behaviors, such as riding in a stroller or being carried by an adult, have not yet been examined. The objective of this study was to describe accelerometry signal outputs recorded during participation in nine types of behaviors (i.e., running, walking, climbing up/down, crawling, riding a ride-on toy, standing, sitting, riding in a stroller/wagon, and being carried by an adult) among toddlers. Twenty-four toddlers aged 13 to 35 months (50% girls) performed various prescribed behaviors during free play in a commercial indoor playroom while wearing ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on a hip and a wrist. Participants’ performances were video-recorded. Based on the video data, accelerometer data were annotated with behavior labels to examine accelerometry signal outputs while performing the nine types of behaviors. Accelerometer data collected during 664 behavior assessments from the 21 participants were used for analysis. Hip vertical axis counts for walking were low (median = 49 counts/5 s). They were significantly lower than those recorded while a toddler was “carried” by an adult (median = 144 counts/5 s; p < 0.01). While standing, sitting, and riding in a stroller, very low hip vertical axis counts were registered (median ≤ 5 counts/5 s). Although wrist vertical axis and vector magnitude counts for “carried” were not higher than those for walking, they were higher than the cut-points for sedentary behaviors. Using various accelerometry signal features, machine learning techniques showed 89% accuracy to differentiate the “carried” behavior from ambulatory movements such as running, walking, crawling, and climbing. In conclusion, hip vertical axis counts alone may be unable to capture walking as physical activity and “carried” as sedentary behavior among toddlers. Machine learning techniques that utilize additional accelerometry signal features could help to recognize behavior types, especially to differentiate being “carried” from ambulatory movements.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Unknown,16,,2019,2019-07-01,"Soyang Kwon, Patricia Zavos, Katherine P.

Graphs are essential in many domains, such as the description of chemical molecules, biological networks, social relationships, etc. Real-world graphs are complicated and large. As a result, there is a need to find a way to represent or encode a graph’s structure so that it can be easily utilized by machine learning models. Therefore, graph embedding is considered one of the most powerful solutions for graph representation. Inspired by the Doc2Vec model in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this paper first investigates different ways of (sub)graph embedding to represent each graph or subgraph as a fixed-length feature vector, which is then used as input to any classifier. Thus, two supervised classifiers—a deep neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)—are proposed to enhance graph classification. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed models obtain competitive results and are superior to some traditional classification methods and deep-learning-based approaches on three out of five benchmark datasets, with an impressive accuracy rate of 94% on the NCI1 dataset.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-06-17,"Sarah G.

Herein, a flexible biomimetic ANS with multimode fuzzy perception and brain‐like cognition is developed, by fusing the ion migration‐modulated MXene synapse and machine learning (ML). First of all, the elementary perceptual ability to mimic biological neuroreceptors is demonstrated. Motion artifact in the ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) current is eliminated. Furthermore, the multimode perception and brain‐like cognition are accomplished by synaptic currents (SCs) and nine ML algorithms. Finally, the cognitions of materials, gestures, and motions are conducted by distributing the ANS devices across body joints, and with the optimal ML method, the accuracies can reach 80%, 100%, and 90%, respectively.

Most of the current research is based on an anchor box. These methods are complex in model design and time-consuming to train. In this paper, we propose a new Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection (FCOS)-based text detection method that can robustly detect multioriented and multilingual text from natural scene images in a per pixel prediction approach. Our proposed text detector employs an anchor-free approach, unlike state-of-the-art text detectors that do not rely on a predefined anchor box. In order to enhance the feature representation ability of FCOS for text detection tasks, we apply the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) as the backbone network, enhancing the model learning capacity and increasing the receptive field. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on multioriented (ICDAR-2015, ICDAR-2017 MLT) and horizontal (ICDAR-2013) text detection benchmark tasks. Moreover, our method has an f-measure of 88.65 and 86.32 for the benchmark datasets ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015, respectively, and 80.75 for the ICDAR-2017 MLT dataset.",Symmetry,journal,1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,486,13,,2021,2021-03-16,"Dongping Cao, Jiachen Dang, Yong Zhong","46690737, 2041846875, 2023972375",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d0a52ce890a794b16d3379f96c6cbb7e0acaa,Computer Science,46690737,['JournalArticle'],8.0,61.0

The goal is to enhance networking within these dynamic environments. By leveraging SDN's centralized control capabilities, this study aims to optimize network performance, enhance security, and improve the quality of service in 5G-VANETs. The outcomes of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems and vehicular communication networks. As the VANET milieu operates dynamically, the major issues are to afford high reliability, low latency, and high bandwidth. 5G significantly provides seamless connectivity and ultrafast speed for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Advancements in internet of vehicle brought few security issues such as illegal device access, data injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To avoid these issues, this work implements the Package Filtering Model (PFM) that is trained using machine learning and ready to use for real-time detection.

A systemic review and a meta-analysis. We also provided a retrospective cohort for validation in this study.


OBJECTIVE
(1) Using a meta-analysis to determine the pooled discriminatory ability of The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classical algorithm (CA) and machine learning algorithms (MLA); and (2) test the hypothesis that SORG-CA has less variability in performance than SORG-MLA in non-American validation cohorts as SORG-CA does not incorporates regional-specific variables such as body mass index as input.


METHODS
After data extraction from the included studies, logit-transformation was applied for extracted AUCs for further analysis. The discriminatory abilities of both algorithms were directly compared by their logit (AUC)s. Further subgroup analysis by region (America vs non-America) was also conducted by comparing the corresponding logit (AUC).


RESULTS
The pooled logit (AUC)s of 90-day SORG-CA was .82 (95% confidence interval [CI], .53-.11), 1-year SORG-CA was 1.11 (95% CI, .74-1.48), 90-day SORG-MLA was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.63), and 1-year SORG-MLA was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.17-1.98). All the algorithms performed better in United States than in Taiwan (P < .001). The performance of SORG-CA was less influenced by a non-American cohort than SORG-MLA.


CONCLUSION
These observations might highlight the importance of incorporating region-specific variables into existing models to make them generalizable to racially or geographically distinct regions.",Global Spine Journal,journal,405be97c-7be0-49bc-8575-24dba18cd046,Global spine journal,"

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) complicates clinical manifestations of stroke. In this study, we redefined the CSVD burden score and incorporated it into a novel radiological-clinical prediction model for SAP. Materials and methods A total of 1278 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 were included. The participants were divided into training and testing groups using fivefold cross-validation method. Four models, two traditional statistical models (logistic regression and ISAN) and two machine learning models (random forest and support vector machine), were established and evaluated. The outcomes and baseline characteristics were compared between the SAP and non-SAP groups. Results Among the of 1278 patients, 281(22.0%) developed SAP after their first ICH. Multivariate analysis revealed that the logistic regression (LR) model was superior in predicting SAP in both the training and testing groups. Independent predictors of SAP after ICH included total CSVD burden score (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.54), haematoma extension into ventricle (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.87–3.31), haematoma with multilobar involvement (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.44–3.18), transpharyngeal intubation operation (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.7–5.62), admission NIHSS score ≥ 10 (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.42–3.01), male sex (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16–2.52), and age ≥ 67 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.56–3.22). The patients in the SAP group had worse outcomes than those in the non-SAP group. Conclusion This study established a clinically combined imaging model for predicting stroke-associated pneumonia and demonstrated superior performance compared with the existing ISAN model. Given the poor outcomes observed in patients with SAP, the use of individualised predictive nomograms is vital in clinical practice.",BMC Pulmonary Medicine,journal,6ec15f55-3f39-4e6e-81c4-b0f2aa166058,BMC Pulmonary Medicine,Unknown,24,,2024,2024-07-24,"Wenru Zhang, Ying Zhou, Liuhui Xu, Chaomin Qiu, Zhixian Luo, Zhenghao Jiang, Xinyi Tao, Yingjie Wu, Shishi Yao, Hang Huang, Xinshi Wang, Yunjun Yang, Ru Lin","2312864048, 2272424983, 2170670021, 2295156156, 2271124396, 2271748002, 2270428859, 2312875339, 2312902269, 2313030846, 2312866805, 2270702453, 2150033004",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000e245ed752d1169163ed02ffc2fdadd18e2540,"Computer Science, Medicine",2312864048,['JournalArticle'],1.0,43.0

However, those systems involve tasks that indirectly map to simple binary commands such as ""yes"" or ""no"" or require many weeks of biofeedback training. We hypothesized that signal processing and machine learning methods can be used to discriminate EEG in a direct ""yes""/""no"" BCI from a single session. Blind source separation (BSS) and spectral transformations of the EEG produced a 180-dimensional feature space. We used a modified genetic algorithm (GA) wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to search the space of feature subsets. The GA-based search found feature subsets that outperform full feature sets and random feature subsets. Also, BSS transformations of the EEG outperformed the original time series, particularly in conjunction with a subset search of both spaces.

Known as precision agriculture, the integration of digital management and surveillance technologies in farming is normatively presented as a revolutionary transformation. Proponents contend that machine learning, Big Data, and automation will create more accurate, efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly food production, staving off both food insecurity and ecological ruin. This article contributes a critique of these rhetorical and discursive claims to a growing body of critical literature on precision agriculture. It argues precision agriculture is less a revolution than an evolution, an effort to shore up and intensify the conventional farming system responsible for generating many of the social and environmental problems precision agriculture is presented as solving. While precision agriculture advocates portray it as a radical, even democratic epistemological break with the past, this paper locates truth claims surrounding datafication and algorithmic control in farming within deeper historical contexts of the capitalist rationalization of production and efforts to quantify and automate physical and mental labor. Abjuring the growing cultural tendency to treat algorithmic systems as revolutionary in favor of social and historical dimensions of precision agriculture, can help re-frame the discussion about its design and use around real, socially and ecologically oriented change in farming, and so ensure that the possibilities and benefits of precision agriculture are as evenly and effectively shared as possible.",Big Data & Society,journal,4d899b46-b5c8-436e-8ce3-084673ea8905,Big Data & Society,Unknown,6,,2019,2019-01-01,Christopher Miles,48512538,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f4079fb3f5463ce7f5e566b541fec68a91f02,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science, Economics, Environmental Science",48512538,['JournalArticle'],115.0,81.0

Previous studies reveal that disordered regions of a protein can be predicted by its primary structure, the amino acid sequence. One observation that has been widely accepted is that ordered regions usually have compositional bias toward hydrophobic amino acids, and disordered regions are toward charged amino acids. Recent studies further show that employing evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) improves the prediction accuracy of protein disorder. As more and more machine learning techniques have been introduced to protein disorder detection, extracting more useful features with biological insights attracts more attention.ResultsThis paper first studies the effect of a condensed position specific scoring matrix with respect to physicochemical properties (PSSMP) on the prediction accuracy, where the PSSMP is derived by merging several amino acid columns of a PSSM belonging to a certain property into a single column. Next, we decompose each conventional physicochemical property of amino acids into two disjoint groups which have a propensity for order and disorder respectively, and show by experiments that some of the new properties perform better than their parent properties in predicting protein disorder. In order to get an effective and compact feature set on this problem, we propose a hybrid feature selection method that inherits the efficiency of uni-variant analysis and the effectiveness of the stepwise feature selection that explores combinations of multiple features. The experimental results show that the selected feature set improves the performance of a classifier built with Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) in comparison with the feature set constructed with PSSMs or PSSMPs that adopt simply the conventional physicochemical properties.ConclusionDistinguishing disordered regions from ordered regions in protein sequences facilitates the exploration of protein structures and functions. Results based on independent testing data reveal that the proposed predicting model DisPSSMP performs the best among several of the existing packages doing similar tasks, without either under-predicting or over-predicting the disordered regions. Furthermore, the selected properties are demonstrated to be useful in finding discriminating patterns for order/disorder classification.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,319 - 319,7,,2006,2006-06-23,"Chung-Tsai Su, Chien-Yu Chen, Yu-Yen Ou","3157188, 97913682, 2781033",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f70100783b16315ff748f23387076fc91d876,"Biology, Computer Science, Medicine",3157188,"['JournalArticle', 'Study']",99.0,48.0

With the advancements in technology, machine learning architectures have become increasingly diverse and sophisticated, providing enhanced capabilities for fruit image classification. However, previous studies have primarily focused on classifying fruits at a basic level. Therefore, there is a growing need for the development and application of Fruit Image Classification systems within the community, particularly in the field of agriculture. Such applications can play a pivotal role in leveraging technology to benefit the agricultural sector, empowering users to gain satisfaction and knowledge regarding different fruits through the utilization of these applications. In this study, we employ both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and a Residual Network-50 for fruit image classification. To ensure robust performance evaluation, the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, with fruits categorized into specific classes. Furthermore, identical preprocessing and optimization techniques are applied to both architectures to maintain consistency and fairness during the evaluation process. The results of our classification experiments on a dataset consisting of 17 different fruit classes reveal that the conventional CNN architecture achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.998 (99%) with a minimal loss of 0.009. On the other hand, the Residual Network-50 demonstrates a slightly lower accuracy of 0.994 (99%) but with a slightly higher loss of 0.02. Despite the higher loss, the Residual Network-50's accuracy remains comparable to that of the conventional architecture, showcasing its potential for fruit image classification. By leveraging the power of machine learning and these advanced architectures, fruit image classification systems can provide valuable insights and assistance to users. They can facilitate informed decision-making in various domains, including agriculture, food production, and consumer education.",SinkrOn,journal,d0d49d6f-212a-445d-a93a-87a97f150ec2,SinkrOn,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-07-30,"Arie Satia Dharma, Judah Michael Parluhutan Sitorus, Andreas Hatigoran","123539048, 2230000137, 2230012656",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001032618456896dd0a618909d0fe443ced9e159,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science",123539048,['JournalArticle'],4.0,19.0

The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

As a result, for hydropower generation to be sustainable, future water availability in hydropower plants must be known. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely estimate how the river flow will alter as a result of changing rainfall patterns.

In this research, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is integrated with a nature-inspired optimizer, namely Cuckoo search algorithm (CS-ANN).

Then, the accuracy of the proposed model will be then examined with the stand-alone Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The statistical indices results indicate that the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model showed an improvement based on R 2 value as compared to ANN model with R 2 of 0.900 at training stage and R 2 of 0.935 at testing stage. RMSE value, for ANN model, is 127.79 m 3 /s for training stage and 12.7 m 3 /s at testing stage. While for the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model, RMSE value is equal to 121.7 m 3 /s for training stage and 10.95 m 3 /s for testing stage. The results revealed that the proposed model outperformed the stand-alone model in predicting the river flow with high level of accuracy. Although the proposed model could be applied in different case study, there is a need to tune the model internal parameters when applied in different case study.",Applied Water Science,journal,3a7506a1-210b-44de-bc20-463e93b86599,Applied Water Science,1-10,13,,2022,2022-12-05,"W.

Machine learning algorithms could provide an objective theoretical basis for tunnel parameter decision making. However, due to the limitations of a machine learning model’s performance and parameter selection methods, the prediction model had poor prediction results and low reliability for parameter research. To solve the above problems, based on a large number of construction parameters of a composite section subway in Shenzhen, this paper combined dimensionality reduction data with service analysis to optimize the selection process of shield tunneling parameters, and determined the total propulsion force, cutter head torque, cutter head speed, and advance rate as key tunneling parameters. Based on an LGBM algorithm and Bayesian optimization, the prediction model of key tunneling parameters of an earth pressure balance shield was established. The results showed that the average error of the LGBM model on the test set was 8.18%, the average error of the cutter head torque was 13.93%, the average error of the cutter head speed was 3.16%, and the average error of advance rate was 13.35%. Compared with the RF model, the prediction effect and the generalization on the test set were better. Therefore, an LGBM algorithm could be used as an effective prediction method for tunneling parameters in tunnel construction and provide guidance for the setting of tunneling parameters.",Buildings,journal,f2c78b1b-6bcc-4700-859b-af9401c02941,Buildings,Unknown,Unknown,,2024,2024-03-18,"Wei Wang, Huanhuan Feng, Yanzong Li, Quanwei You, Xu Zhou","2158625346, 2292351109, 2292205846, 2228271705, 2292731898",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011cc42b727f0c20683a45184e30bcc6668835c,"Computer Science, Engineering",2158625346,['JournalArticle'],1.0,24.0

Nowadays, going 24 hours without getting in touch with them in some way has become difficult. Facebook and Twitter, these social platforms are now part of everyday life. Thus, these social networks have become important sources to be aware of frequently discussed topics or public opinions on a current issue. A lot of people write messages about current events, give their opinion on any topic and discuss social issues more and more. The emergence and enormous popularity of these social networks have led to the emergence of several types of analysis to take advantage of them. One of them is the analysis of opinions in texts. It aims at automatically classifying opinions in order to position them on a sentiment scale, thus allowing to characterize a set of opinions without having to rely on a human to read them. Currently, opinion analysis offers us a lot of information related to public opinion, either in the commercial world or in the political world. Many studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB), perform well in this type of classification. In our study, we first propose an approach for tracking and analyzing political opinions in social networks. Then, we propose a trained and evaluated machine learning model for political opinion classification. And finally, the study aims at setting up a web interface to collect and analyze in real time political opinions from social networks",International journal of Web & Semantic Technology,journal,a6c17d51-9c07-495f-ae6b-3738e69a9098,International journal of Web & Semantic Technology,Unknown,Unknown,,2021,2021-10-31,"Télesphore Tiendrébéogo, Yassia Zagre","2111964, 2140541021",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011fc48fe76fd7f48139a75f9bdf1a83e0f4cd9,Political Science,2111964,,0.0,36.0

Hence, the limitations of prediction models can highly impact prioritizing maintenance tasks and allocating budget. This study aims to investigate the potential of different predictive models in reaching an effective and efficient maintenance plan. This paper reviews the literature on predictive analytics for a set of highway assets. It also highlights the gaps and limitations of the current methodologies, such as subjective assumptions and simplifications applied in deterministic and probabilistic approaches. This article additionally discusses how these shortcomings impact the application and accuracy of the methods, and how advanced predictive analytics can mitigate the challenges. In this review, we discuss how advancements in technologies coupled with ever-increasing computing power are creating opportunities for a paradigm shift in predictive analytics. We also propose new research directions including the application of advanced machine learning to develop extensible and scalable prediction models and leveraging emerging sensing technologies for collecting, storing and analyzing the data. Finally, we addressed future directions of predictive analysis associated with the data-rich era that will potentially help transportation agencies to become information-rich.",Civil Engineering Journal,journal,fd49fc9f-b490-4e1a-b878-7b04b957d1bd,Civil Engineering Journal,Unknown,Unknown,,2020,2020-03-01,"Arash Karimzadeh, O.

When the size of datasets becomes very large, it may be infeasible to store all of the high-dimensional datasets on one machine, or at least to keep the datasets in memory. In this paper, we consider penalized expectile regression using smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and adaptive LASSO penalties, which can effectively detect the heteroskedasticity of high-dimensional data. We propose a communication-efficient approach for distributed sparsity learning, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines. By selecting the appropriate tuning parameters, we show that the proposed estimators display oracle properties. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,64732-64746,9,,2021,,"Yingli Pan, Zhanxu Liu","152270990, 1453924341",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001288472fc275eeb035da4ba9bd9ec97ec6e9f7,"Computer Science, Mathematics",152270990,['JournalArticle'],0.0,33.0

Although many NER models based on machine learning have been proposed, their performance in terms of processing fine-grained NER tasks was less than acceptable. This is because the training data of a fine-grained NER task is much more unbalanced than those of a coarse-grained NER task. To overcome the problem presented by unbalanced data, we propose a fine-grained NER model that compensates for the sparseness of fine-grained NEs by using the contextual information of coarse-grained NEs. From another viewpoint, many NER models have used different levels of features, such as part-of-speech tags and gazetteer look-up results, in a nonhierarchical manner. Unfortunately, these models experience the feature interference problem. Our solution to this problem is to adopt a multi-stacked feature fusion scheme, which accepts different levels of features as its input. The proposed model is based on multi-stacked long short-term memories (LSTMs) with a multi-stacked feature fusion layer for acquiring multilevel embeddings and a dual-stacked output layer for predicting fine-grained NEs based on the categorical information of coarse-grained NEs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed model is capable of state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the proposed model can effectively alleviate the unbalanced data problem that frequently occurs in a fine-grained NER task. In addition, the multi-stacked feature fusion layer contributes to the improvement of NER performance, confirming that the proposed model can alleviate the feature interference problem. Based on this experimental result, we conclude that the proposed model is well-designed to effectively perform NER tasks.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,,2021,2021-11-15,"Hongjin Kim, Harksoo Kim","2110134563, 2108880610",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0014ecb6e7055de7b3bef3d5619446c24fdf0db4,"Computer Science, Linguistics",2110134563,,5.0,8.0

Conveniently, these compact devices are also equipped with high-precision transducers such as accelerometers and microphones, integrated mechanically and designed on-board to support a range of user functionalities. However, unintended access to these transducer signals (bypassing normal on-board data access controls) may allow sensitive user interaction information to be detected and thereby exploited. In this study, we show that acoustic features extracted from the on-board microphone signals, supported with accelerometer and gyroscope signals, may be used together with machine learning techniques to successfully determine the user’s touch input location on a touchscreen: our ensemble model, namely the random forest model, predicts touch input location with up to 86% accuracy in a realistic scenario. Accordingly, we present the approach and techniques used, the performance of the model developed, and also discuss limitations and possible mitigation methods to thwart possible exploitation of such unintended signal channels.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,4834,11,,2021,2021-05-25,"K.

Yet the current paradigm for perfusion MRI analysis treats all voxels or regions‐of‐interest as isolated systems supplied by a single global source. This simplification not only leads to long‐recognized systematic errors but also fails to leverage the embedded spatial structure within the data. Since the early 2000s, a variety of models and implementations have been proposed to analyze systems with between‐voxel interactions. In general, this leads to large and connected numerical inverse problems that are intractible with conventional computational methods. With recent advances in machine learning, however, these approaches are becoming practically feasible, opening up the way for a paradigm shift in the approach to perfusion MRI. This paper seeks to review the work in spatiotemporal modelling of perfusion MRI using a coherent, harmonized nomenclature and notation, with clear physical definitions and assumptions. The aim is to introduce clarity in the state‐of‐the‐art of this promising new approach to perfusion MRI, and help to identify gaps of knowledge and priorities for future research.",Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,journal,c1269fa2-b51c-4648-bf0c-95797c4a74cd,Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,1136 - 1148,91,,2023,2023-11-06,"Eve S Shalom, Amirul Khan, S. van Loo, S.

A case-control study was conducted and included 177 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 173 control subjects to study the involvement of CD36 gene rs1761667 (G>A) and rs1527483 (C>T) polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of T2DM and dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Lipid profile, blood sugar, gender and age were measured and recorded. Also, genotyping analysis for both polymorphisms was performed. Following statistical analysis, 10 different neural networks and machine learning (ML) tools were used to predict subjects with diabetes or dyslipidemia. Towards further understanding of the role of CD36 protein and gene in T2DM and dyslipidemia, a protein-protein interaction network and meta-analysis were carried out. For both polymorphisms, the genotypic frequencies were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). On the other hand, some ML tools like multilayer perceptron gave high prediction accuracy (≥ 0.75) and Cohen’s kappa (κ) (≥ 0.5). Interestingly, in K-star tool, the accuracy and Cohen’s κ values were enhanced by including the genotyping results as inputs (0.73 and 0.46, respectively, compared to 0.67 and 0.34 without including them). This study confirmed, for the first time, that there is no association between CD36 polymorphisms and T2DM or dyslipidemia among Jordanian population.

The previously used linear method, unable to cope with the augmented features, is replaced with a boosting classifier assisted by feature selection. The methods indicated show improved performance for 6 language pairs, when applied on the output from MT systems developed over 7 years. The improved models compete better with reference-aware metrics. Notable conclusions are reached through the examination of the contribution of the features in the models, whereas it is possible to identify common MT errors that are captured by the features. Many grammatical/fluency features have a good contribution, few adequacy features have some contribution, whereas source complexity features are of no use.

Reliable and updated road information thus calls for conventional on-site survey being replaced by more accurate and efficient remote sensing technology. Generally, this approach involves image enhancement and extraction of relevant features, such as elongate gradient and intersecting corners. Thus far, its implication is often impeded by wrongly extraction of other urban peripherals with similar pixel characteristics. This paper therefore proposes the fusion of THEOS satellite image and topographic derivatives, obtained from underlying Digital Surface Models (DSM). Multi-spectral indices in thematic layers and surface properties of designated roads were both fed into state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The results were later fused, taken into account consistently leveled road surface. The proposed technique was thus able to eliminate irrelevant urban structures such as buildings and other constructions, otherwise left by conventional index based extraction.

This research focuses on exploring the latest solutions in preventing DDoS attacks and emphasizes how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is involved in enhancing end-to-end detection techniques. Through the analysis of several key approaches, this work notes that AI-guided models quickly identify and counteract any unusual traffic patterns that may indicate an oncoming DDoS attack. Essential aspects towards creating more resilient networks against such attacks include machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data analytics together with AI based detection systems for traffic pattern recognition. Importantly, AI does well in behavioral analysis because it can distinguish and adapt to changing attack vectors. Additionally, it puts AI into perspective as making positive mitigation strategies possible that contain quick interferences such as temporary halt of traffic, rerouting and targeted block listing with real time control panel operations. On the contrary, current DDoS detection prevention techniques remain critically addressed of persistent challenges and limitations fundamental to them. From what emerges, they should always be ready for innovation and improvement because of how attacks might evolve over time. This paper aligns itself with the position that AI-driven detection mechanisms are natural to network security against DDoS attacks. It underlines the importance of integrating AI-based solutions with conventional practices in order to enhance network resilience and efficiently counteract cyber threats that are evolving all the time.",Indonesian Journal of Computer Science,journal,f5cd2a19-4ebb-4a91-b0de-777a2e52ce7c,The Indonesian Journal of Computer Science,Unknown,Unknown,,2024,2024-04-20,"Soran Hamad, S.

In this paper, we present a novel efficient method for thermal and energy management based on bimodal airflow-temperature sensing and reinforcement learning, which expedites an exploration process by self-learning and adjusts action policy only through actuators interacting with the environment, being free of the controlled object model and priori experiences. In general, training of reinforcement learning requires a large amount of data iterations, which takes a long time and is not suitable for real-time control. Here, we propose an approach to speed up the learning process by indicating the action adjustment direction. We adopt tailor-designed bimodal sensors to simultaneously detect airflow and temperature field, which provides comprehensive information for reinforcement learning. The proposed thermal and energy management incorporates bimodal parametric sensing with an improved actor-critic algorithm to realize self-learning control. Experiments of thermal and energy management in a multi-module integrated system validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which demonstrate high efficiency, fast response, and good robustness in various control scenarios. The proposed methodology can be widely applied to thermal and energy management of diverse integrated systems.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,Unknown,Unknown,,2018,2018-09-27,"Zhen Zhang, Cheng Ma, Rong Zhu","2118029605, 144970602, 2070270377",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001833f130bdc2b1547a3c8896cf1d920dcaab89,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",2118029605,,6.0,33.0

As a result, this research examines the rising body of knowledge on social media and crisis management. [1] Between October 2017 and January 2018, a review was conducted, which included locating and retrieving records from an electronic database. The outcomes of this study indicated that the rise of social media has altered the landscape of crisis communication by allowing for greater engagement. However, due to its nature, social media might also be used to spark a crisis. This means that the crisis can be both produced and disseminated through social media. Nonetheless, social media's promise as a crisis-resolution tool is undeniable. It has the capability of proving a claim, dispelling false rumors, or just demonstrating a fact. As a result, practitioners should understand how social media works and how to best use it to interact with their stakeholders. This study also includes other findings, limits, and useful suggestions for scholars and practitioners interested in learning more about the role of social media on crisis communication and management. As most of the crisis problem were reported via twitter. However, most of the problem reported and corresponding responses via twitter were not successfully exchanged between victim’s and resource organization. As a result, most of the tweets were not getting help. Thus, we designed a platform where people can avail the resources of crisis through tweets matching concept using machine learning.","International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology",journal,18be6e14-0ac5-454e-b78d-100e2dddd04e,"International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology",Unknown,Unknown,,2022,2022-04-22,"Shaikh Areeba Abdul Hakeem, Muskan Singh, Pooja Nandukumar Shingewad, Shruti Shrikant Nikam","2163319579, 2163320822, 2163320765, 2163321391",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0019a174cf9c82fc7084a3a27e548c2a06e0a8c9,Computer Science,2163319579,['Review'],0.0,6.0

A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction (DOI) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network (NN), as well as a multiple linear regression (MLR)-based method to estimate DOI in depolished PET detector arrays with single-sided readout. The algorithms were tested on an 8× 8 array of 1.53× 1.53× 15 mm3 crystals and a 4× 4 array of 3.1× 3.1× 15 mm3 crystals, both made of Ce:LYSO scintillators and coupled to a 4× 4 array of 3× 3 mm3 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Using the conventional linear DOI estimation method resulted in an average DOI resolution of 3.76 mm and 3.51 mm FWHM for the 8× 8 and the 4× 4 arrays, respectively. Application of MLR outperformed the conventional method with average DOI resolutions of 3.25 mm and 3.33 mm FWHM, respectively. Using the machine learning approaches further improved the DOI resolution, to an average DOI resolution of 2.99 mm and 3.14 mm FWHM, respectively, and additionally improved the uniformity of the DOI resolution in both arrays. Lastly, preliminary results obtained by using only a section of the crystal array for training showed that the NN-based methods could be used to reduce the number of calibration steps required for each detector array.",Physics in Medicine and Biology,journal,d5594aad-095f-4587-802a-b011732c7100,Physics in Medicine & Biology,Unknown,65,,2020,2020-06-22,"A.

Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. To address the class imbalance problem (few real miRNAs and a large number of pseudo miRNAs), the prediction models in miRLocator were optimized by considering critical (and often ignored) factors that can markedly affect the prediction accuracy of mature miRNAs, including the machine learning algorithm and the ratio between training positive and negative samples. Ten-fold cross-validation on 5854 experimentally validated miRNAs from 19 plant species showed that miRLocator performed better than the state-of-art miRNA predictor miRdup in locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. miRLocator will aid researchers interested in discovering miRNAs from model and non-model plant species.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,10,,2015,2015-11-11,"HaiBo Cui, Jingjing Zhai, Chuang Ma","2112820873, 6989114, 49679382",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c15accd39827ecf9838d496b7e44e9f890ee7,"Biology, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Medicine",2112820873,['JournalArticle'],26.0,21.0

The current prognosis approaches include radiological examination and detection of serum biomarkers, however, both have limited efficiency and are ineffective in early prognosis. Due to such limitations, we propose to use RNA-Seq data for evaluating putative higher accuracy biomarkers at the transcript level that could help in early prognosis. To identify such potential transcript biomarkers, RNA-Seq data for healthy liver and various HCC cell models were subjected to five different machine learning algorithms: random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and neural networks. Various metrics, namely sensitivity, specificity, MCC, informedness, and AUC-ROC (except for support vector machine) were evaluated. The algorithms that produced the highest values for all metrics were chosen to extract the top features that were subjected to recursive feature elimination. Through recursive feature elimination, the least number of features were obtained to differentiate between the healthy and HCC cell models. From the metrics used, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of the known protein biomarkers for HCC is comparatively lower than complete transcriptomics data. Among the different machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector machine demonstrated the best performance. Using recursive feature elimination on top features of random forest and support vector machine three transcripts were selected that had an accuracy of 0.97 and kappa of 0.93. Of the three transcripts, two were protein coding (PARP2–202 and SPON2–203) and one was a non-coding transcript (CYREN-211). Lastly, we demonstrated that these three selected transcripts outperformed randomly taken three transcripts (15,000 combinations), hence were not chance findings, and could then be an interesting candidate for new HCC biomarker development. Using RNA-Seq data combined with machine learning approaches can aid in finding novel transcript biomarkers. The three biomarkers identified: PARP2–202, SPON2–203, and CYREN-211, presented the highest accuracy among all other transcripts in differentiating the healthy and HCC cell models. The machine learning pipeline developed in this study can be used for any RNA-Seq dataset to find novel transcript biomarkers.

This study investigated and analyzed particulate matter data from Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Jeollanam-do, with a particular focus on PM2.5. Descriptive statistics, box-and-whisker plots, correlation matrices, time variations, and trend analyses were performed for this purpose. Additionally, a prediction model for PM2.5 concentrations was developed using machine learning techniques, through which future changes in air quality were forecasted. 
Calculations were performed using R-based programs and R packages. Hourly PM2.5 data were obtained from air quality monitoring sites in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon. After data preprocessing, the optimal prediction model was constructed using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine from various machine learning algorithms. 
The research results showed that there was more PM2.5 pollution in Gwangyang compared to Yeosu and Suncheon. The PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly across each monitoring site. Among the monitoring sites, the Yeosu site showed a higher correlation in PM2.5 with each other than other sites. Late winter and early spring showed higher PM2.5 concentrations, while summer and autumn showed lower concentrations. Weekly PM2.5 concentration fluctuations were not significantly different. Daily fluctuations showed an increase in PM2.5 concentrations during times of traffic congestion and a decrease in the afternoon. During the research period, the trend of PM2.5 concentration was generally decreasing. 
The accuracy of the prediction model through machine learning was over 90%, and it is expected to assist in establishing effective response strategies for future changes in air quality. This study provided an updated and useful evaluation of recent PM2.5 air quality in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Korea.",International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication,journal,30f717c3-b4cb-461f-9152-25a2fc4208e8,International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-10-30,"Hyun Sim, Hyunwook Kim",2273444328,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c7d8d86582b11da522c0885509610ca86007e,"Computer Science, Environmental Science",2273444328,['JournalArticle'],0.0,0.0

A postural habit that has been formed cannot be changed easily. It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,,2018,2018-08-01,"Y.

STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,17,,2022,2022-08-11,"Mansour Al Sulaiman, Abdullah M.

Neuroimaging and machine learning approaches provide new research directions to explore the brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms after stroke. We applied machine learning to predict the classification of the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for motor improvement and identify the neuroimaging features, in order to explore brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms for motor recovery after stroke. Methods In this study, 49 patients with unilateral motor pathway injury (basal ganglia and/or corona radiata) after ischemic stroke were included and evaluated the motor function by Fugl–Meyer Assessment scores (FMA) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up sessions. Patients were divided by the difference between the twice FMA scores into one group showing minimal clinically important difference (MCID group, n = 28) and the other group with no minimal clinically important difference (N-MCID, n = 21). Machine learning was performed by PRoNTo software to predict the classification of the patients and identify the feature brain regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, a matched group of healthy controls (HC, n = 26) was enrolled. Patients and HC underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination in the resting state and in the acupuncture state (acupuncture at the Yanglingquan point on one side) to compare the differences in brain functional connectivity (FC) and acupuncture effects. Results Through machine learning, we obtained a balance accuracy rate of 75.51% and eight feature ROIs. Compared to HC, we found that the stroke patients with lower FC between these feature ROIs with other brain regions, while patients in the MCID group exhibited a wider range of lower FC. When acupuncture was applied to Yanglingquan (GB 34), the abnormal FC of patients was decreased, with different targets of effects in different groups. Conclusion Feature ROIs identified by machine learning can predict the classification of stroke patients with different motor improvements, and the FC between these ROIs with other brain regions is decreased. Acupuncture can modulate the bilateral cerebral hemispheres to restore abnormal FC via different targets, thereby promoting motor recovery after stroke.

Significance Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms have rapidly become much more widespread for numerous biomedical applications, including the diagnosis and categorization of disease and injury. Aim Here, we seek to characterize the recent growth of ML techniques that use imaging data to classify burn wound severity and report on the accuracies of different approaches. Approach To this end, we present a comprehensive literature review of preclinical and clinical studies using ML techniques to classify the severity of burn wounds. Results The majority of these reports used digital color photographs as input data to the classification algorithms, but recently there has been an increasing prevalence of the use of ML approaches using input data from more advanced optical imaging modalities (e.g., multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography), in addition to multimodal techniques. The classification accuracy of the different methods is reported; it typically ranges from ∼70% to 90% relative to the current gold standard of clinical judgment. Conclusions The field would benefit from systematic analysis of the effects of different input data modalities, training/testing sets, and ML classifiers on the reported accuracy. Despite this current limitation, ML-based algorithms show significant promise for assisting in objectively classifying burn wound severity.",Journal of Biomedical Optics,journal,3a712262-b7d9-4756-94a1-57c2f9d4197c,Journal of Biomedical Optics,Unknown,29,,2024,2024-02-01,"Robert H Wilson, Rebecca Rowland, Gordon T.

However, more knowledge of protein structure-activity correlation is required to improve the efficacy of the drugs targeting GPCRs. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict activation state and activity level of the receptors with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we applied this model to thousands of molecular dynamics trajectories to correlate residue-level conformational changes of a GPCR to its activity level. Finally, the most probable transition pathway between activation states of a receptor can be identified by using the state-activity information. In addition, with this model, we can associate the contribution of each amino acid to the activation process. Using this method we will be able to design drugs that mainly target principal amino acids driving the transition between activation states of GPCRs.

Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in male and female low-IMF (162 DEGs, including 64 up- and 98 down-regulated genes) and high-IMF pigs (202 DEGs, including 147 up- and 55 down-regulated genes). Moreover, hub genes were screened via PPI network construction. Furthermore, hub genes were screened for potential sex-specific biomarkers using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator machine learning algorithm, and sex-specific biomarkers in low-IMF (troponin I (TNNI1), myosin light chain 9(MYL9), and serpin family C member 1(SERPINC1)) and high-IMF pigs (CD4 molecule (CD4), CD2 molecule (CD2), and amine oxidase copper-containing 2(AOC2)) were identified, and then verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in semimembranosus muscles. Additionally, the gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of hallmark gene sets were collectively performed on the identified biomarkers. Finally, the transcription factor-biomarker and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (biomarker) networks were predicted. The identified potential sex-specific biomarkers may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of IMF deposition and the beneficial foundation for improving meat quality in pig breeding.",Genes,journal,3a435ff9-d0c3-4eb9-9a89-992c0f8bf398,Genes,Unknown,14,,2023,2023-08-25,"Yongli Yang, Xiaoyi Wang, Shuyan Wang, Qiang Chen, Mingli Li, Shaoxiong Lu","2236388442, 2155610656, 2108710355, 2146379306, 47629206, 8090588",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e4348bf3ea69ac952c0078282041986cdec3d,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Medicine",2236388442,['JournalArticle'],2.0,81.0

However, multivariate mineralogical data must be transformed into lithological domains such that it is compatible with interpolation techniques and be usable for geomodeling. Manual interpretation of multivariate drill-core data is a challenging, time-consuming and subjective task, and automated or semi-automated approaches are needed. However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection. In this way, the correlation pattern between the variables is incorporated into the segmentation. The scalogram accurately locates the geological boundaries at depth and yields hierarchical geological domains with mineralogical composition characteristics. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a synthetic as well as a real multivariate dataset. The real dataset consists of mineral abundances derived from drill-core hyperspectral imaging data acquired in Elvira, a shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D. Our approach provides an automatic way to transform hyperspectral image-derived mineral maps into vertically coherent geological units that are appropriate inputs for 3D geological modeling workflows. Moreover, the method improves the boundary detection and geological domaining by making use of multivariate information.",Remote Sensing,journal,8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

These methods outperform traditional, rule-based approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of intersecting features. However, existing deep learning-based AFR methods face two major challenges. The initial challenge stems from the frequent utilization of voxelized or point-cloud representations of CAD models, resulting in the unfortunate loss of valuable geometric and topological information inherent in original Boundary representation (B-Rep) models. The second challenge involves the limitation of supervised deep learning methods in identifying machining features that are not present in the predefined dataset. This constraint renders them suboptimal for the continually evolving datasets of real industrial scenarios. To address the first challenge, this study introduces a graph-structured language, Multidimensional Attributed Face-Edge Graph (maFEG), crafted to encapsulate the intricate geometric and topological details of CAD models. Furthermore, a graph neural network, Sheet-metalNet, is proposed for the efficient learning and interpretation of maFEGs. To tackle the second challenge, a three-component incremental learning strategy is proposed: an initial phase of pre-training and fine-tuning, a prototype sampling-based replay, and a stage employing knowledge distillation for parameter regularization. The effectiveness of Sheet-metalNet and its complementary incremental learning strategy is evaluated using the open-source MFCAD++ dataset and the newly created SMCAD dataset. Experimental results show that Sheet-metalNet surpasses state-of-the-art AFR methods in machining feature recognition accuracy. Moreover, Sheet-metalNet demonstrates adaptability to dynamic dataset changes, maintaining high performance when encountering newly introduced features, thanks to its innovative incremental learning strategy.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,Unknown,14,,2024,2024-05-09,"Liuhuan Ma, Jiong Yang","2300714018, 2300498524",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ebb9f4f55c4e4e139d8c14d13808d6b5f6ba1,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2300714018,['JournalArticle'],1.0,53.0

Over the past decade, the utilization of machine learning (ML) methodologies for MAR modeling and prediction has increased significantly. This review evaluates all supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and ensemble ML models employed to predict MAR factors and parameters, rendering it the most comprehensive contemporary review on this subject. This study presents a concise and integrated overview of MAR's most effective ML approaches, focusing on design, suitability for water quality (WQ) applications, and GWM. The paper examines performance measures, input specifications, and the variety of ML functions employed in GWM, and highlights prospects. It also offers suggestions for utilizing ML in MAR, addressing issues related to physical aspects, technical advancements, and case studies.

Therefore, the spectral pre-processing method of spectral-to-spectral ratio (S/S), as well as multiple characteristic wavelength member model fusion (MCMF) and characteristic wavelength and non-characteristic wavelength member model fusion (CNCMF) methods, were proposed for improving the detection performance of apple whole fruit SSC by diffuse reflection (DR), diffuse transmission (DT) and full transmission (FT) spectra. The modeling analysis showed that the S/S- partial least squares regression models for all three mode spectra had high prediction performance. After competitive adaptive reweighted sampling characteristic wavelength screening, the prediction performance of all three model spectra was improved. The particle swarm optimization–extreme learning machine models of MCMF and CNCMF had the most significant enhancement effect and could make all three mode spectra have high prediction performance.

It is a concern that continues to be analyzed and addressed for solutions. Missing data occurs when there is no data stored for certain variables relating to participants. In health surveys, when participants answer in the form of “I don't know” or “I'd prefer not to answer”, these responses can, in many cases, be categorized as missing data responses from a participant in a specific category or question. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is an essential tool in healthcare and clinical settings to assess an individual's mental health, specifically related to symptoms of depression. The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with the total score obtained by summing the scores for each item. Higher PHQ-8 scores indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. We used empirical data from a previous study on depression symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease to study the effect of considering the answers “I do not know” and “I prefer not to answer” as missing values when estimating the percentage of depression using PHQ-8. Moreover, we studied the effect of the complete case analysis and multiple imputation on parameter estimates and confidence intervals. The outcome of this study aims to shed light on the development of missing data procedural knowledge and provide methodological support for public health decision-making when data with missing values are collected. Furthermore, this study aims to prevent the exclusion of missing data rather than to generate data. Methods A simulation study with 1000 replicates was performed. Four common statistical machine learning methods for handling missing values were included in this study. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-Means, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest (RF) imputations. Five clusters were used for KNN and K-mean. Likewise, five multiple imputations were used for the CART and RF methods. The simulation was based on publicly available data with available PHQ-8 data for 1096 subjects. In the simulation study and for each replication, multivariate missing values were generated using the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% proportions of missingness. The percent of depression was calculated using the PHQ-8 questionnaire and a comparison was made between estimated actual depression, complete-case analysis, KNN, Kmean, RF, and CART, respectively. Results The Median age of the subjects was 69 (interquartile range: 61–67) and more males (72.9%) than females were included in the data. The estimated actual depression was 16.8, whereas the estimated percentage of depression varies between 6.9–13.5, 16.2–16.7, 16.3–16.7, 16.6–16.7 and 16.7–16.8 for the complete case, KNN, Kmean, RF and CART respectively. Conclusion The results of this simulation study show that missing PHQ-8 data are best handled by applying multiple imputations based on CART or RF. However, using K-Means or KNN leads to a good estimate of the true percentage of depression. Furthermore, the results of this simulation study show that complete-case analysis leads to biased estimates of the true percentage of depression. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to address the problem of missing PHQ-8 data under the assumption of missing not at random.",BJPsych Open,journal,7e6a8e7b-939b-4d19-af46-0878b11ff420,BJPsych Open,S172 - S172,10,,2024,2024-06-01,"Khalid Suliman, M.

Thus, data augmentation methods have been developed to improve classifiers by artificially created training data. In NLP, there is the challenge of establishing universal rules for text transformations which provide new linguistic patterns. In this paper, we present and evaluate a text generation method suitable to increase the performance of classifiers for long and short texts. We achieved promising improvements when evaluating short as well as long text tasks with the enhancement by our text generation method. Especially with regard to small data analytics, additive accuracy gains of up to 15.53% and 3.56% are achieved within a constructed low data regime, compared to the no augmentation baseline and another data augmentation technique. As the current track of these constructed regimes is not universally applicable, we also show major improvements in several real world low data tasks (up to +4.84 F1-score). Since we are evaluating the method from many perspectives (in total 11 datasets), we also observe situations where the method might not be suitable.

It requires manual design features, which consumes manpower and material resources, and identifies crops with a single type, and the results are bad. Therefore, to find an efficient and fast real-time disease image recognition method is very meaningful. Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that can automatically learn representative features to achieve better results in areas of image recognition. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use deep learning methods to identify crop pests and diseases and to find efficient and fast real-time image recognition methods of disease. Deep learning is a newly developed discipline in recent years. Its purpose is to study how to actively obtain a variety of feature representation methods from data samples and rely on data-driven methods, a series of nonlinear transformations are applied to finally collect the original data from specific to abstract, from general to specified semantics, and from low-level to high-level characteristic forms. This paper analyzes the classical and the latest neural network structure based on the theory of deep learning. For the problem that the network based on natural image classification is not suitable for crop pest and disease identification tasks, this paper has improved the network structure that can take care of both recognition speed and recognition accuracy. We discussed the influence of the crop pest and disease feature extraction layer on recognition performance. Finally, we used the inner layer as the main structure to be the pest and disease feature extraction layer by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the inner and global average pooling layers. We analyze various loss functions such as Softmax Loss, Center Loss, and Angular Softmax Loss for pest identification. In view of the shortcomings of difficulty in loss function training, convergence, and operation, making the distance between pests and diseases smaller and the distance between classes more greater improved the loss function and introduced techniques such as feature normalization and weight normalization. The experimental results show that the method can effectively enhance the characteristic expression ability of pests and diseases and thus improve the recognition rate of pests and diseases.

Doppler lidar are hampered by several sources of uncertainty in the lidar
measurement, affecting both bias and random errors. Two problems encountered
especially for nacelle-mounted lidar are solid interference due to
intersection of the line of sight with solid objects behind, within, or in
front of the measurement volume and spectral noise due primarily to
limited photon capture. These two uncertainties, especially that due to
solid interference, can be reduced with high-fidelity retrieval techniques
(i.e., including both quality assurance/quality control and subsequent
parameter estimation). Our work compares three such techniques, including
conventional thresholding, advanced filtering, and a novel application of
supervised machine learning with ensemble neural networks, based on their
ability to reduce uncertainty introduced by the two observed nonideal
spectral features while keeping data availability high. The approach
leverages data from a field experiment involving a continuous-wave (CW)
SpinnerLidar from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) that provided
scans of a wide range of flows both unwaked and waked by a field turbine.
Independent measurements from an adjacent meteorological tower within the
sampling volume permit experimental validation of the instantaneous velocity
uncertainty remaining after retrieval that stems from solid interference and
strong spectral noise, which is a validation that has not been performed
previously. All three methods perform similarly for non-interfered returns,
but the advanced filtering and machine learning techniques perform better
when solid interference is present, which allows them to produce overall
standard deviations of error between 0.2 and 0.3 m s−1, or a 1 %–22 %
improvement versus the conventional thresholding technique, over the rotor
height for the unwaked cases. Between the two improved techniques, the
advanced filtering produces 3.5 % higher overall data availability, while
the machine learning offers a faster runtime (i.e., ∼ 1 s
to evaluate) that is therefore more commensurate with the requirements of
real-time turbine control. The retrieval techniques are described in terms
of application to CW lidar, though they are also relevant to pulsed lidar.
Previous work by the authors (Brown and Herges, 2020) explored a novel
attempt to quantify uncertainty in the output of a high-fidelity lidar
retrieval technique using simulated lidar returns; this article provides
true uncertainty quantification versus independent measurement and does so
for three techniques rather than one.

Research on public opinion in the field of machine learning usually focuses on micro-sentiment judgment, which is unable to offer support for the evaluation of public opinion events without additional data, and research from the perspective of artificial weighting has the disadvantage of the confusion of explanation. Judging the urgency of public opinion events is usually based on human perception, which is fuzzy and conforms to the attribute of fuzzy mathematics. Therefore, the index system in this paper was constructed in line with five principles, from which the weights were scientifically evaluated by integrating the DEMATEL and ANP model, and fuzzy mathematics was applied to determine the urgency level of public opinion. The result has three-fold significance. First, the index system constructed was more closely linked. Second, the integration of the DEMATEL and ANP weight calculating model took the interdependence of indicators fully into account. Third, fuzzy mathematics provided support for determining the public opinion crisis level, especially in the absence of immediate dissemination data.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-05-06,"Hua Wang, Ling Luo, Tao Liu","2155242880, 2114162969, 2149917006",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0022e5a46097180bf7c98c038c14d48631acb150,Computer Science,2155242880,['JournalArticle'],3.0,16.0

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from proximal sensors and the high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provide an opportunity to monitor the crop water status efficiently. Based on data from an experimental tomato field with intensive aerial and plant-based measurements, we developed random forest machine learning regression models to estimate tomato stem water potential (ψ stem), (using observations from proximal sensors and 12-band UAV imagery, respectively, along with weather data. The proximal sensor-based model estimation agreed well with the plant ψ stem with R 2 of 0.74 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.63 bars. The model included PRI, normalized difference vegetation index, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature and tracked well with the seasonal dynamics of ψ stem across different plots. A separate model, built with multiple vegetation indices (VIs) from UAV imagery and weather variables, had an R 2 of 0.81 and MAE of 0.67 bars. The plant-level ψ stem maps generated from UAV imagery closely represented the water status differences of plots under different irrigation treatments and also tracked well the temporal change among flights. PRI was found to be the most important VI in both the proximal sensor- and the UAV-based models, providing critical information on tomato plant water status. This study demonstrated that machine learning models can accurately estimate the water status by integrating PRI, other VIs, and weather data, and thus facilitate data-driven irrigation management for processing tomatoes.",Frontiers in Plant Science,journal,e110cc75-cd00-4b7f-968c-fd70b464a553,Frontiers in Plant Science,Unknown,14,,2023,2023-04-06,"Zhehan Tang, Yufang Jin, P.

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a washing procedure that guarantees effective and safe cleaning. This organization recommends that States promote this activity and monitor it continuously. Based on this fact, this article presents a work oriented to study the feasibility of identifying the moments in which a person carried out a hand washing, determining its beginning and duration, as well as if these washings were compliant with the WHO guidelines. The identification of washing moments is made through the analysis, by means of Machine Learning techniques, of the data that can be collected from the inertial sensors of the smartwatch the person is wearing. This study was carried out with the participation of 15 volunteers. Data was not only collected in controlled settings but, also, more than 600 hours of sensor measurements come from free-live conditions. The results of the study showed that it is feasible to build a solid solution based on the use of low cost wearables for the identification of washing moments. The solution is very effective (with F1 over 95%) with user-dependent models. Also, with user-independent models, the identification of WHO washings is also very effective (with F1 above 85%), but more limited in the detection of free washings (F1 around 55%).",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,133574-133593,9,,2021,,"Juan M.

This study retrospectively investigated newly diagnosed cases of MBNs from our laboratory to investigate mutation landscapes in Chinese patients with MBNs and to combine mutational information and machine learning (ML) into clinical applications for MBNs, especially for subtype classification. Methods Samples from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database were collected for ML model construction and cases from our laboratory were used for ML model validation. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation Random Forest algorithm was used for ML model construction. Mutation detection was performed by NGS and tumor cell size was confirmed by cell morphology and/or flow cytometry in our laboratory. Results Totally 849 newly diagnosed MBN cases from our laboratory were retrospectively identified and included in mutational landscape analyses. Patterns of gene mutations in a variety of MBN subtypes were found, important to investigate tumorigenesis in MBNs. A long list of novel mutations was revealed, valuable to both functional studies and clinical applications. By combining gene mutation information revealed by NGS and ML, we established ML models that provide valuable information for MBN subtype classification. In total, 8895 cases of 8 subtypes of MBNs in the COSMIC database were collected and utilized for ML model construction, and the models were validated on the 849 MBN cases from our laboratory. A series of ML models was constructed in this study, and the most efficient model, with an accuracy of 0.87, was based on integration of NGS testing and tumor cell sizes.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stage of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this, we proposed a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. In general we have six machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, classifier and feed forward neural network to establish models. In existing system random forest achieved the performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. In proposed system, By analysing the misjudgments generated by the above model, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron which could achieve an efficient accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.

The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease’s onset. The findings underline the potential of machine learning to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and therapy planning while emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in artificial intelligence-based healthcare systems.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,5618-5633,13,,2025,,"Tarek Khater, A.

The severity of MS disease is monitored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, composed of several functional sub-scores. Early and accurate classification of MS disease severity is critical for slowing down or preventing disease progression via applying early therapeutic intervention strategies. Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) create opportunities to apply data-driven and predictive modeling tools for this goal. Previous studies focusing on using single-modal machine learning and deep learning algorithms were limited in terms of prediction accuracy due to data insufficiency or model simplicity. In this paper, we proposed the idea of using patients’ multimodal longitudinal and longitudinal EHR data to predict multiple sclerosis disease severity in the future. Our contribution has two main facets. First, we describe a pioneering effort to integrate structured EHR data, neuroimaging data and clinical notes to build a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict patient’s MS severity. The proposed pipeline demonstrates up to 19% increase in terms of the area under the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) compared to models using single-modal data. Second, the study also provides valuable insights regarding the amount useful signal embedded in each data modality with respect to MS disease prediction, which may improve data collection processes.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,journal,76da9cc5-c5a7-42b4-a250-3e708c5f4980,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,Unknown,23,,2023,2023-11-09,"Kai Zhang, John A.

There is a major gap between a model that looks good on paper and a model that performs well in the drug discovery process. We are trying to shrink this gap by introducing the Evaluation Framework For predicting Efficiency of Cancer Treatment (EFFECT) benchmark suite based on the DepMap and GDSC data sets to facilitate the creation of well-applicable machine learning models capable of predicting gene essentiality and/or drug sensitivity on in vitro cancer cell lines. We show that standard evaluation metrics like Pearson correlation are misleading due to inherent biases in the data. Thus, to assess the performance of models properly, we propose the use of cell line/perturbation exclusive data splits, perturbation-wise evaluation, and the application of our Bias Detector framework, which can identify model predictions not explicable by data bias alone. Testing the EFFECT suite on a few popular machine learning (ML) models showed that while library-standard non-linear models have measurable performance in splits representing precision medicine and target identification tasks, the actual corrected correlations are rather low, showing that even simple knock-out (KO)/drug sensitivity prediction is a yet unsolved task.

Regional ethnic traditional sports are not only a sports business but also a tourism resource. The construction of a reasonable regional sports tourism resource classification model is fundamental to the development of sports tourism resources. However, the existing sports tourism resources classification is mostly constructed manually based on the national standard tourism resources classification system. The efficiency and accuracy of the traditional manual classification are poor and cannot reflect the characteristics of regional ethnic traditional sports tourism. In order to solve the above problems, a machine learning-based classification method for regional ethnic traditional sports tourism resources is proposed. Firstly, the relevant concepts and characteristics of traditional sports tourism resources are introduced. Then, taking the development of traditional sports of ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province as the research object, SWOT analysis, literature, interview, questionnaire, and mathematical statistics are used to investigate and analyse the overall status of the development of regional ethnic traditional sports. Secondly, a classification evaluation method based on an optimised back-propagation (BP) neural network is proposed.

The results of robust features were also compared with conventional techniques without considering the robustness of radiomic features. Methods An in-house developed lung phantom was developed with two 22mm lesion sizes based on a clinical study. A specific motor was built to simulate motion in two orthogonal directions. Lesions of both clinical and phantom studies were segmented using a Fuzzy C-means-based segmentation algorithm. After inducing motion and extracting 105 radiomic features in 4 feature sets, including shape, first-, second-, and higher-order statistics features from each region of interest (ROI) of the phantom image, statistical analyses were performed to select robust features against motion. Subsequently, these robust features and a total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from 126 clinical data. Various feature selection (FS) and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers were implemented to predict the LVI of NSCLC, followed by comparing the results of predicting LVI using robust features with common conventional techniques not considering the robustness of radiomic features. Results Our results demonstrated that selecting robust features as input to FS algorithms and ML classifiers surges the sensitivity, which has a gentle negative effect on the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) of predictions compared with commonly used methods in 12 of 15 outcomes. The top performance of the LVI prediction was achieved by the NB classifier and RFE FS without considering the robustness of radiomic features with 95% area under the curve of AUC, 67% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, the top performance of the LVI prediction using robust features belonged to the NB classifier and Boruta feature selection with 92% AUC, 86% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Conclusion Robustness over various influential factors is critical and should be considered in a radiomic study. Selecting robust features is a solution to overcome the low reproducibility of radiomic features.

However, building a Machine learning model from scratch to classify Thai cultural images can be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data. In this study, we investigate the use of transfer learning for the task of image classification on a dataset of Thai cultural images. We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration. To better understand the reasoning behind the predictions made by the models, we deployed the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique to generate heatmaps that the models attend to when making predictions.

This is a difficult question that was addressed carefully in a recent paper that focused on the validity of the GRACE score to predict in-hospital mortality. (1) Why is this high-quality study by Mangariello and Gitelman important? Prediction models are increasingly published in the medical literature. Newer methods are proposed, such as labeled machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. Whatever the method of development, the key issue is whether the prediction model or algorithm provides valid predictions for physicians and their patients who rely on them as a source of information and decision making. Indeed, the authors rightly argue that many differences between settings may be present. These include differences in patient characteristics, healthcare systems, and socioeconomic environment. Moreover, treatment may change over time. All these differences may make a previously developed model not valid for the particular setting where the model is applied, for example the Dr. Juan A. Fernández Hospital in Buenos Aires. Therefore, a model may need updating for a specific setting.

Three potential biomarkers (SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2) were screened using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning based on sialylation-related genes. Moreover, the combined model of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 showed excellent diagnostic value in both the training and validation cohorts. Importantly, a Sial-score was constructed based on the expression of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2. The Sial-low group showed a lower level of immune infiltration than the Sial-high group.

The Baekje weir in South Korea presents an interesting case as the weir has undergone full gate opening, which is generally not the case for weirs and reservoirs, providing valuable opportunity for simulating weir removal conditions. The main objectives are investigation of groundwater level fluctuations under various weir operations, distances from the weir, and seasonal variations. The study utilizes observed data that simulates conditions with and without the weir, including scenarios of full gate opening. Multiple machine learning algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—are used to develop accurate groundwater level prediction models. The models' performance is assessed using coefficient of determination, Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indices, and visualized through Taylor diagrams. Results indicate that XGBoost outperforms other models in all three groups during both training and testing phases. Specifically, XGBoost surpasses RF by 2.09% (R2), 5.66% (RMSE), and 10.1% (MAE) in training, and outperforms SVR by 11.2% (R2), 42.0% (RMSE), and 129.2% (MAE) in testing.

Although the human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied extensively in the last few decades, the in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose estimation problems. However, the in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes with specific challenges, including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout the day and having pose distribution different from the common human surveillance viewpoint. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly reduce the effectiveness of the existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge, the infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with the unconventional pose perspective, a 2- end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. The deep learning framework proves to be the most effective model in human pose estimation; however, the lack of large public dataset for in-bed poses prevents us from using a large network from scratch. In this paper, we explored the idea of employing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-tuning the model using our own shallow (limited in size and different in perspective and color) in-bed IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-trained CNN called convolutional pose machine (CPM) was fine-tuned for in-bed pose estimation by re-training its specific intermediate layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.",IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,journal,5b1ab359-1a03-4a1b-b41d-332a3fbfd5b3,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,Unknown,7,,2017,2017-11-03,"Shuangjun Liu, Yu Yin, S.

Clients who want to classify their data send them to a server that performs their inference using a trained model. The client must trust the server and provide the data in plaintext. Moreover, if the classification is done at a third-party cloud service, the model owner also needs to trust the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privately evaluating decision trees. The protocol uses a novel private comparison function based on fully homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) scheme and a programmable bootstrapping technique. Our comparison function for 32-bit and 64-bit integers is 26% faster than the naive TFHE implementation. The protocol is designed to be non-interactive and is less complex than the existing interactive protocols. Our experiment results show that our technique scales linearly with the depth of the decision tree and efficiently evaluates large decision trees on real datasets. Compared with the state of the art, ours is the only non-interactive protocol to evaluate a decision tree with high precision on encrypted parameters.

This study employs computational algorithms to automatically identify and classify features in X‐Ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy images. Principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian mixture (GM) clustering, are implemented to label features on a collection of XRF maps of human atherosclerotic plaque samples. The investigation involves the hard X‐Ray nanoprobe (NanoMAX) at MAX IV synchrotron radiation facility, utilizing scanning transmission X‐Ray microscopy (STXM) and XRF techniques. The analysis covers regions of interest scanned by the beam with a step size of 200 nm, yielding XRF maps of elements like calcium, iron, and zinc. These maps reveal intricate structures unsuitable for manual labeling. However, they can be accurately classified in an automated fashion using GM. Prior to clustering, PCA is used to deal with repeated patterns and background areas. The resulting clusters are associated with different types of features, which can be identified as specific tissues confirmed by histology. Regions of high concentrations of phosphorus, sulfur, calcium, and iron are found in the samples. These regions are also observed in the STXM results as spots of low transmission that typically are associated with calcium deposits only.",Advanced Intelligent Systems,journal,a03d184e-0f87-4242-aea8-2fb5c3179483,Adv.

Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are used to inform citizens about the political stances of the parties that involved in the upcoming elections, in an effort to facilitate their decision making process and increase their participation in this democratic process. VAA is a Web application that calls the users and parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, which are based on the current affairs of their country and then it recommends to each user the party that better fits their political views. SVAAs, a social recommendation approach of VAAs, on the other hand, base their recommendation on the VAA community of users in a collaborative filtering manner. In this paper we resort to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of SVAAs. In particular, we try to model party-supporters using HMMs and then use these models to recommend each VAA user the party whose model best fits his/her answer sequence of the VAA policy statements. HMMs proved to be effective machine learning tools for sequential and correlated data and this is the main rationale behind this study. VAA policy statements are usually correlated and grouped into categories such as external policy, economy, society, etc. As a result, opting from the various answer choices in each policy statement might be related with selections in previous and subsequent policy statements. Given that the order of policy statements is kept fixed within each VAA one can assume that (a) answer patterns (sequences of choices for all policy statements included in the VAA) can be found that characterise ‘typical’ voters of particular parties, and (b) the answer choice in each policy statement can be ‘predicted’ from previous answer choices. For our experiments we use three datasets based on the 2014 elections to the European Parliament (http://www.euvox2014.eu/), which are publicly available through the Preference Matcher website (http://www.preferencematcher.org/?page_id=18).",EPJ Data Science,journal,aa12af37-66cf-4a5d-9368-18b04d86d37f,EPJ Data Science,1-19,5,,2016,2016-12-13,"Marilena Agathokleous, N.

Given the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges of employing children, young adults (18–40) can serve as suitable substitutes due to the similarity in their taste sensitivity. Taste panellists need not be experts in sensory evaluation so long as a reference product is used during evaluation; however, they should be screened for bitterness taste detection thresholds. For a more robust evaluation during the developmental phase, considerations of a scoring system and the calculation of an acceptance value may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of recommending a formulation for further development. On the technological front, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be exploited in taste-masking optimisation of medicinal formulations as they can model complex relationships between variables and enable predictions not possible previously to optimise product profiles. Machine learning classifiers may therefore tackle the challenge of predicting the bitterness intensity of paediatric formulations. While advancements have been made, further work is needed to identify effective taste-masking techniques for specific drug molecules. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms, using human panellist acceptability scores, can aid in enhancing paediatric formulation development and overcoming taste-masking challenges.",Pharmaceutics,journal,3c77be64-fcd3-444d-a98d-f563ab841a7e,Pharmaceutics,Unknown,15,,2023,2023-08-01,"O.

Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid separation)–residue positions distant in sequence, but in close proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL::Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models folded was reduced by an average of 2 Å for a benchmark of 25 membrane proteins.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,12,,2017,2017-05-24,"Pedro L Teixeira, Jeffrey L.

Methods A systematic search was conducted in ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts from July 2005 to May 2022. Machine learning approaches, including modified Lasso penalized regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were applied to identify hub ARGs, thereby developing a prediction model termed ARG classifier. Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the model was comprehensively analyzed using multi-transcriptome data. Subsequently, we systematically correlated the ARG classifier/hub ARGs with immunological characteristics of multiple aspects, including immune cell infiltration, immune and molecular pathways, cytokine levels, and immune-related genes. Further, we collected clinical specimens to preliminarily investigate ARG expression levels and to assess the diagnostic performance of ARG classifier. Results A total of ten GEO and three ArrayExpress datasets were included in this study. Based on machine learning algorithms, eight key ARGs (ATG4C, BAX, BIRC5, ERBB2, FKBP1B, HIF1A, NCKAP1, and NFKB1) were integrated to establish ARG classifier. The model exhibited excellent diagnostic values (AUC > 0.85) in multiple datasets and multiple points in time and superiorly distinguished sepsis from other critical illnesses. ARG classifier showed significant correlations with clinical characteristics or endotypes and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.70) than other clinical characteristics. Additionally, the identified hub ARGs were significantly associated with immune cell infiltration (B, T, NK, dendritic, T regulatory, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), immune and molecular pathways (inflammation-promoting pathways, HLA, cytolytic activity, apoptosis, type-II IFN response, complement and coagulation cascades), levels of several cytokines (PDGFRB, IL-10, IFNG, and TNF), which indicated that ARG classifier/hub ARGs adequately reflected the immune microenvironment during sepsis. Finally, using clinical specimens, the expression levels of key ARGs in patients with sepsis were found to differ significantly from those of control patients, and ARG classifier exhibited superior diagnostic performance, compared to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion Collectively, a diagnostic and prognostic model (ARG classifier) based on eight ARGs was developed which may assist clinicians in diagnosis of sepsis and recognizing patient at high risk to guide personalized treatment. Additionally, the ARG classifier effectively reflected the immune microenvironment diversity of sepsis and may facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",Journal of Inflammation Research,journal,2264e13c-a38e-4a95-ad47-1fd698d3fc68,Journal of Inflammation Research,6165 - 6186,15,,2022,2022-11-01,"Zhen Chen, Liming Zeng, Genglong Liu, Yangpeng Ou, Chuangang Lu, Ben Yang, Liuer Zuo","2117102276, 48973295, 2109614753, 12043454, 1677675795, 2163274691, 11909287",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028df26e5831b753f7ae8cdafb379cbd4e78165,"Computer Science, Medicine",2117102276,['JournalArticle'],15.0,31.0

Previous studies have shown that endorsing conspiracy beliefs leads to lower protective guideline adherence (i.e., wearing face masks), posing a threat to public health measures. The current study expands this research across the lifespan, i.e., in a sample of adolescents with mental health problems. Here, we investigated the association between conspiracy beliefs and guideline adherence while also exploring the predictors of conspiracy beliefs. Methods N  = 93 adolescent psychiatric outpatients (57% female, mean age: 15.8) were assessed using anonymous paper–pencil questionnaires. Endorsement of generic and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was assessed, in addition to items measuring adherence to protective guidelines and mental health (stress, depressive symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and adverse childhood experiences). Multiple regressions and supervised machine learning (conditional random forests) were used for analyses. Results Fourteen percent of our sample fully endorsed at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory, while protective guidelines adherence was relatively high ( M  = 4.92, on a scale from 1 to 7). The endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs—but not of generic conspiracy beliefs—was associated with lower guideline adherence (β = − 0.32, 95% CI − 0.53 to − 0.11, p  < .001). Conditional random forests suggested that adverse childhood experiences and peer and conduct problems were relevant predictors of both conspiracy belief categories. Conclusion While a significant proportion of our sample of adolescents in psychiatric treatment endorsed conspiracy beliefs, the majority did not. Furthermore, and to some degree, contrary to public perception, we found that adolescents show relatively good adherence to public health measures—even while experiencing a high degree of mental distress. The predictive value of adverse childhood experiences and peer/conduct problems for conspiracy beliefs might be explained by compensatory mechanisms to ensure the safety, structure, and inclusion that conspiracies provide.",Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,journal,12be30c9-5ddf-49b3-bed9-d9fe5fcd9a19,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,Unknown,17,,2023,2023-01-24,"Andreas Goreis, Bettina Pfeffer, H.

Specifically, convolutional, recurrent, and recursive networks can provide the largest improvement over traditional methods, in part by effectively utilizing distance within the jet or clustering history.

Considering the countless impacts of human activity on persons' everyday life, we have analyzed the correlation between human activity and their product preferences in our study and proposed that daily human activity could be a metric for product recommendation models. To address this previously unaccounted phenomenon, a new approach is presented in our study that gives real-time recommendations to users by observing their activeness in daily life. However, product recommendation systems mostly believe in ratings, and the purchase behavior of users instead of investigating the precious insights of users' daily activities. But we examined smartphones' GPS sensor data using machine learning algorithms to urge insights from users' daily activeness and proposed a model for predicting the product of interest of the purchasers, based on the activeness of their daily life. Moreover, based on our model, we have introduced a prototype of a real-time recommendation system, especially for the retail shops that rely on users' implicit data from smartphone sensors to form product recommendations. For conducting our study, we developed an android application that—collects embedded smartphone sensor data and can detect objects to provide product recommendations and product details. Experiment shows, that our proffered daily activeness-based recommendation system using smartphone sensor data, performs with a precision of 66%, but it is also a promising performance because it does not use customers' explicit feedback.",International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies,journal,d9a75178-eeee-483f-a8ad-b31eec96072c,Int.

However finding effective solution to these problems has been rendered difficult. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents an analytical Machine learning model that suitably combined the graph signature with random forest techniques. This study presents the design and realization of a novel Intelligent Citizenship Identity through family pedigree using Graph Signature based random forest (GSB-RF) model. The study also showcases the development of a novel graph signature technique referred to as Canonical Code Signature(CCS) method. The CCS method is used at the pre-processing stage of the identification process to build signature for any given tuple. Performance comparisim between the present system and the baseline techniques which includes: the K-Nearest Neighbour and the traditional Random Forest shows that the present system outperformed the baseline method studied. The proposed system shows capability to perform continuous re-identification of Citizens based on their family pedigree with ability to select best sample with low computational complexity, high identification accuracy and speed. Our experimental result shows that the precision rate and identification quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%. Therefore, the proposed Citizenship Identification machine is capable of providing usable, consistent, efficient, faster and accurate identification, to the users, security agents, government agents and institutions on-line, real-time and at any-time.Keywords- Canonical code,Citizenship Identity, Family pedigree,Graph-Signature,Machine learning, Random-forest",FUOYE Journal of Engineering and Technology,journal,1ec80c25-9740-4be7-9f28-c42e8ea619ed,FUOYE Journal of Engineering and Technology,Unknown,Unknown,,2021,2021-06-29,"A.

Especially as the number of variables in real-world medical data increases, causal discovery becomes more and more effective. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop new causal discovery algorithms suitable for small data sets for situations where sample sizes are insufficient to detect reasonable causal relationships, such as rare diseases and emerging infectious diseases. This study aims to develop a new causal discovery algorithm suitable for a small number of real-world medical data using quantum computing, one of the emerging information technologies attracting attention for its application in machine learning. In this study, a new algorithm that applies the quantum kernel to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, one of the causal discovery algorithms, is developed. Experiments on several artificial data sets showed that the new algorithm proposed in this study was more accurate than existing methods with the Gaussian kernel under various conditions in the low-data regime. When the new algorithm was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which the causal structure could be correctly estimated even when the amount of data was small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing the new algorithm on real quantum hardware was discussed. This study suggests that the new proposed algorithm using quantum computing might be a good choice among the causal discovery algorithms in the low-data regime for novel medical knowledge discovery.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLOS ONE,Unknown,18,,2021,2021-10-09,H.

 This paper proposes a new state of charge estimation method inspired by the Fourier neural operator, which is capable of learning entire nonlinear dynamics of any partial differential equations. The complicated nonlinear dynamics of battery parameters is well captured by a flexible, efficient, and expressive structure of the Fourier neural operators. Extensive numerical experiments and tests with publicly available data as well as with our own data are conducted to demonstrate the noise-tolerance, time window independence, temperature generalization, and transfer learning features of the proposed method.

Despite the overwhelming QCD background, recent advances in jet substructure have put the observation of the gg→H→bb¯$$ gg\to H\to b\overline{b} $$ channel at the LHC within the realm of possibility. In order to enhance the sensitivity to this process, we develop a two-stream convolutional neural network, with one stream acting on jet information and one using global event properties. The neural network significantly increases the discovery potential of a Higgs signal, both for high-pT Standard Model production as well for possible beyond the Standard Model contributions. Unlike most studies for boosted hadronically decaying massive particles, the boosted Higgs search is unique because double b-tagging rejects nearly all background processes that do not have two hard prongs. In this context — which goes beyond state-of-the-art two-prong tagging — the network is studied to identify the origin of the additional information leading to the increased significance. The procedures described here are also applicable to related final states where they can be used to identify additional sources of discrimination power that are not being exploited by current techniques.",Journal of High Energy Physics,journal,cb5c6d2c-8c82-406e-b42e-b691561f3e4e,Journal of High Energy Physics,1-25,2018,,2018,2018-07-27,"J.

Methods After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. Results This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm explains the individualized predictions. Conclusions In conclusion, our study accomplished the successful development and validation of ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with CHF combined with CKD.

The iCPH platform combines humanoid robots as “physical twins” of human and “digital twins” that simulates humans and robots in cyber-space. Several critical research topics are introduced to address this challenge by leveraging the advanced model-based analysis together with data-driven learning to exploit collected data from the integrated platform of iCPH. Definition of general description is identified as the first topic as a common basis of contact motions compatible to both humans and humanoids.

Such solutions work as building blocks in forming inoficial access to various domains, suggesting real-time protection and gretaly unclear communications. The conventional paradigm depends heavily on preprepared lists of known malicious domains, necessitating frequent updates to maintain relevance. However, this method shows inadequate in yet-to-be-cataloged malicious or domains identifying emerging, leading to potential vulnerabilities. Throughout this paper, a creative research endeavor is discussed to shed lights on presenting a cutting-edge DNS firewall solution that proves the power of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The major purpose is to use the real-time detection of malicious domain requests, thereby critically enhancing cybersecurity protocols. A reasonable assembled dataset, incorporating 34 intricate features and meticulously recorded instances totaling 90,000, was critically chosen from genuine DNS logs. Similarly, it becomes more riched through the careful integration of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) sources.

When an object is placed on the metasurface, local changes can be detected in one or more of the structure’s meta-atoms. This interaction generally modifies the inductance of the meta-atom, resulting in changes to the overall input impedance of the surface. We derive the properties of the structure and its behaviour in terms of superposition and demonstrate that observing the meta-surface from a single point is sufficient for unambiguous localisation and identification. To model these changes effectively and identify the position of an object, we employ a neural network machine learning algorithm.

It creates an adverse impact on flyrock. Thus, it is essential to forecast flyrock to minimize the environmental effects. The objective of this study is to forecast/estimate the amount of flyrock produced during blasting by applying three creative composite intelligent models: equilibrium optimizer-coupled extreme learning machine (EO-ELM), particle swarm optimization-based extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). To obtain a successful conclusion, we considered 114 blasting data parameters consisting of eight inputs (hole diameter, burden, stemming length, rock density, charge-per-meter, powder factor (PF), blastability index (BI), and weathering index), and one output parameter (flyrock distance). We then compared the results of different models using seven different performance indices. Every predictive model accomplished the results comparable with the measured values of flyrock. To show the effectiveness of the developed EO-ELM, the result from each model run 10-times is compared. The average result shows that the EO-ELM model in testing (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 32.14, MAE = 19.78, MAPE = 20.37, NSE = 0.93, VAF = 93.97, A20 = 0.57) achieved a better performance as compared to the PSO-ANN model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 64.44, MAE = 36.02, MAPE = 29.96, NSE = 0.72, VAF = 74.72, A20 = 0.33) and PSO-ELM model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 48.55, MAE = 26.97, MAPE = 26.71, NSE = 0.84, VAF = 84.84, A20 = 0.51). Further, a non-parametric test is performed to assess the performance of these three models developed. It shows that the EO-ELM performed better in the prediction of flyrock compared to PSO-ELM and PSO-ANN. We did sensitivity analysis by introducing a new parameter, WI. Input parameters, PF and BI, showed the highest sensitivity with 0.98 each.",Sustainability,journal,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-02-10,"R. M.

We present outcome (‘recovered’, ‘isolated’ or ‘death’) risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over ‘early’ datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used ‘country’, ‘age’ and ‘gender’ as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient’s ‘disease’ history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results The use of a patient’s ‘disease’ history improves the prediction of ‘death’ by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent’s ‘disease’ history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient’s ‘disease’ history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,journal,76da9cc5-c5a7-42b4-a250-3e708c5f4980,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,Unknown,21,,2020,2020-07-02,"Koffka Khan, E.

Therefore, it is vital to predict NAO events. Since the NAO event can be quantified by the NAO index, an effective neural network model EEMD-ConvLSTM, which is based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), is proposed for NAO index prediction in this paper. EEMD is applied to preprocess NAO index data, which are issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NAO index data are decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). After being filtered by the energy threshold, the remaining IMFs are used to reconstruct new NAO index data as the input of ConvLSTM. In order to evaluate the performance of EEMD-ConvLSTM, six methods were selected as the benchmark, which included traditional models, machine learning algorithms, and other deep neural networks. Furthermore, we forecast the NAO index with EEMD-ConvLSTM and the Rolling Forecast (RF) and compared the results with those of Global Forecast System (GFS) and the averaging of 11 Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model ensemble members (ENSM) provided by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. The experimental results show that EEMD-ConvLSTM not only has the highest reliability from evaluation metrics, but also can better capture the variation trend of the NAO index data.",Atmosphere,journal,0a6835b2-217d-4708-8735-f574a583a7d7,Atmosphere,Unknown,Unknown,,2019,2019-05-07,"Shijin Yuan, Xiaodan Luo, Bin Mu, Jing Li, G.

Mining of symbolic data is more difficult than numerical data due to the lack of inherent geometric properties of this type of data. In this paper, we use two kinds of kernel learning methods to create a kernel estimation model and a nonlinear classification algorithm for symbolic data. By using the kernel smoothing method, we construct a squared-error consistent probability estimator for symbolic data, followed by a new data transformation model proposed to embed symbolic data into Euclidean space. Based on the model, the inner product and distance measure between symbolic data objects are reformulated, allowing a new Support Vector Machine (SVM), called SVM-S, to be defined for nonlinear classification on symbolic data using the Mercer kernel learning method. The experiment results show that SVM can be much more effective for symbolic data classification based on our proposed model and measures.","Soft Computing - A Fusion of Foundations, Methodologies and Applications",journal,32505816-936f-497d-8f3c-ee241a290329,Soft Computing,1249 - 1259,26,,2021,2021-10-25,"Xuanhui Yan, Lifei Chen, G.

Although different solutions have been exercised against phishing, phishing attacks have dramatically increased in the past few years. Recent studies have shown that machine learning has become prominent in the present anti-phishing context, and the techniques like deep learning have extensively improved anti-phishing tools’ detection ability. This paper proposes PhishDet, a new way of detecting phishing websites through Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network and Graph Convolutional Network using URL and HTML features. PhishDet is the first of its kind, which uses the powerful analysis and processing capabilities of Graph Neural Network in the anti-phishing domain and recorded 96.42% detection accuracy, with a 0.036 false-negative rate. It is effective against zero-day attacks, and the average detection time which is 1.8 seconds could also be considered realistic. The feature selection of PhishDet is automatic and occurs inside the system, as PhishDet gradually learns URLs and HTML content features to handle constantly changing phishing attacks. This has outperformed similar solutions by achieving a 99.53% f1-score with a public benchmark dataset. However, PhishDet requires periodic retraining to maintain its performance over time. If such retraining could be facilitated, PhishDet could fight against phishers for a more extended period to safeguard Internet users from this Internet threat.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,82355-82375,10,,2022,,"Subhash Ariyadasa, S.

This approach is based on the fact that at a given EFT order, the full angular distribution in the most important electroweak processes can be expressed as a sum of a fixed number of basis functions. The coefficients of these basis functions — the so-called angular moments — and their energy dependance, thus form an ideal set of experimental observables that encapsulates the complete multi-dimensional differential information of the process. This approach is generic and the observables constructed allow to avoid blind directions in the SMEFT parameter space. While this method is applicable to many of the important electroweak processes, as a first example we study the pp → V(ℓℓ)h(bb) process (V ≡ Z/W±, ℓℓ ≡ ℓ+ℓ−/ℓ±ν), including QCD NLO effects, differentially. We show that using the full differential data in this way plays a crucial role in simultaneously and maximally constraining the different vertex structures of the Higgs coupling to gauge bosons.

To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit. In comparison with other similar types of models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF), the classification accuracy of JMLA is 97.9% on the train set. The accuracy rate on the test set reached 97.6%. The results of the research demonstrate that JMLA can improve the accuracy of the glass type classification problem, greatly enhance the research efficiency of archaeological staff, and gain a more reliable result.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-05-30,"Zhi-Xing Li, Pengsen Lu, Guang-Yan Wang, Jia-Hui Li, Zhen-Hao Yang, Yunpeng Ma, Hong-Hai Wang","2218899393, 2214180256, 2152582807, 2218880417, 2029319614, 2218675820, 2196698773",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0032ae42a28ed484aa7440742767b0e9e9a7dcff,"History, Materials Science",2218899393,['JournalArticle'],4.0,70.0

With huge success and diverse benefits, the paradigm faces several challenges as well. Power consumption, dynamic resource scaling, and over- and under-provisioning issues are challenges for the cloud computing paradigm. The research has been carried out in cloud computing for resource utilization prediction to overcome over- and under-provisioning issues. Over-provisioning of resources consumes more energy and leads to high costs. However, under-provisioning induces Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and Quality of Service (QoS) degradation. Most of the existing mechanisms focus on single resource utilization prediction, such as memory, CPU, storage, network, or servers allocated to cloud applications but overlook the correlation among resources. This research focuses on multi-resource utilization prediction using Functional Link Neural Network (FLNN) with hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs’ chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed. The dataset and code used are publicly available on Mendeley Data and GitHub, respectively.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLOS ONE,Unknown,18,,2023,2023-06-21,"Marinara Marcato, Salvatore Tedesco, C.

 With the emerging developments in millimeter-wave/5G technologies, the potential for wireless Internet of things devices to achieve widespread sensing, precise localization, and high data-rate communication systems becomes increasingly viable. The surge in interest surrounding virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies is attributed to the vast array of applications they enable, ranging from surgical training to motion capture and daily interactions in VR spaces. To further elevate the user experience, and real-time and accurate orientation detection of the user, the authors proposes the utilization of a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system coupled with an ultra-low-power, sticker-like millimeter-wave identification (mmID). The mmID features four backscattering elements, multiplexed in amplitude, frequency, and spatial domains. This design utilizes the training of a supervised learning classification convolutional neural network, enabling accurate real-time three-axis orientation detection of the user. The proposed orientation detection system exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 90.58% over three axes at a distance of 8 m. This high accuracy underscores the precision of the orientation detection system, particularly tailored for medium-range VR/AR applications. The integration of the FMCW-based mmID system with machine learning proves to be a promising advancement, contributing to the seamless and immersive interaction within virtual and augmented environments.",International journal of microwave and wireless technologies,journal,976d9362-f9c5-46d8-b219-e34993ab000d,International Journal of Microwave and Wireless Technologies,Unknown,Unknown,,2024,2024-11-13,"Marvin Joshi, Charles A.

This proof-of-concept study used machine-learning strategies to predict pain severity and interference in 47 young women, ages 18 to 30, who experienced an incident of IPV (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) within three months of their baseline assessment. Young women are more likely than men to experience IPV and to subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Women completed a comprehensive assessment of theory-driven cognitive and neurobiological predictors of pain severity and pain-related interference (e.g., pain, coping, disability, psychiatric diagnosis/symptoms, PTSD/trauma, executive function, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress response). Gradient boosting machine models were used to predict symptoms of pain severity and pain-related interference across time (Baseline, 1-,3-,6- follow-up assessments). Models showed excellent predictive performance for pain severity and adequate predictive performance for pain-related interference. This proof-of-concept study suggests that machine-learning approaches are a useful tool for identifying predictors of pain development in survivors of recent IPV. Baseline measures of pain, family life impairment, neuropsychological function, and trauma history were of greatest importance in predicting pain and pain-related interference across a 6-month follow-up period. Present findings support the use of machine-learning techniques in larger studies of post-IPV pain development and highlight theory-driven predictors that could inform the development of targeted early intervention programs. However, these results should be replicated in a larger dataset with lower levels of missing data.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,Unknown,16,,2021,2021-07-29,"E.

Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14 months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000 cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.",Veterinary Medicine International,journal,e9256dd3-be3a-4cc1-8c58-f046aea49466,Veterinary Medicine International,Unknown,2025,,2025,2025-01-01,"R.

However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume. The findings contribute to our understanding of onabotulinumA injection treatment for OAB and support evidence-based decision-making using readily available information.",Cureus,journal,87c855fc-c59a-4443-832a-e5b1ca14b9f3,Cureus,Unknown,15,,2023,2023-07-01,"N.

Although the body of work in privacy has been steadily growing over the past few years, research on the privacy aspects of machine learning has received less focus than the security aspects. Our contribution in this research is an analysis of more than 45 papers related to privacy attacks against machine learning that have been published during the past seven years. We propose an attack taxonomy, together with a threat model that allows the categorization of different attacks based on the adversarial knowledge, and the assets under attack. An initial exploration of the causes of privacy leaks is presented, as well as a detailed analysis of the different attacks.

Here, we report a new development of the SAAFEC method, the SAAFEC-SEQ, which is a gradient boosting decision tree machine learning method to predict the change of the folding free energy caused by amino acid substitutions. The method does not require the 3D structure of the corresponding protein, but only its sequence and, thus, can be applied on genome-scale investigations where structural information is very sparse. SAAFEC-SEQ uses physicochemical properties, sequence features, and evolutionary information features to make the predictions. It is shown to consistently outperform all existing state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and root-mean-squared-error parameters as benchmarked on several independent datasets.

Although formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are deemed crucial for research and clinical applications, the fixation process results in molecular damage to nucleic acids, thus confounding their use in genome sequence analysis. Methods to improve genomic data quality from FFPE tissues have emerged, but there remains significant room for improvement. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from matched Fresh Frozen (FF) and FFPE tissue samples to optimize a sensitive and precise FFPE single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling approach. We present methods to reduce the prevalence of false-positive SNVs by applying combinatorial techniques to five publicly available variant callers. We also introduce FFPolish, a novel variant classification method that efficiently classifies FFPE-specific false-positive variants.

The genetic association signals between 5-HTTLPR and psychiatric phenotypes, however, have been inconsistent across many studies. Since the polymorphism cannot be tested via available SNP arrays, we had previously proposed an efficient machine learning algorithm to predict the genotypes of 5-HTTLPR based on the genotypes of eight nearby SNPs, which requires access to individual-level genotype and phenotype data. To utilize the advantage of publicly available GWAS summary statistics obtained from studies with very large sample sizes, we develop a GWAS summary-statistics-based approach for testing the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) associations with various phenotypes. We first cross-verify the accuracy of the summary-statistics-based approach for 61 phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Since we observed a strong similarity between the predicted individual-level 5-HTTLPR genotype-based approach and the summary-statistics-based approach, we applied our method to the available neurobehavioral GWAS summary statistics data obtained from large-scale GWAS. We found no genome-wide significant evidence for association between 5-HTTLPR and any of the neurobehavioral traits. We did observe, however, genome-wide significant evidence for association between this locus and human adult height, BMI, and total cholesterol. Our summary-statistics-based approach provides a systematic way to examine the role of VNTRs and related types of genetic polymorphisms in disease risk and trait susceptibility of phenotypes for which large-scale GWAS summary statistics data are available.",European Journal of Human Genetics,journal,07e65705-6eb2-4447-ab15-03c2167a4540,European Journal of Human Genetics,547 - 554,30,,2021,2021-12-23,"Arunabha Majumdar, Preksha Patel, B.

However, some of these algorithms are inscrutable, namely, they produce predictions that humans cannot understand or explain. This trait is in tension with the emphasis on reason‐giving in administrative law. The article explores this tension, advancing two interrelated arguments. First, providing adequate reasons is a significant facet of respecting individuals’ agency. Incorporating inscrutable algorithmic predictions into administrative decision‐making compromises this normative ideal. Second, as a long‐term concern, the use of inscrutable algorithms by administrative agencies may generate systemic effects by gradually reducing the realm of the humanly explainable in public life, a phenomenon Max Weber termed ‘re‐enchantment’. As a result, the use of inscrutable machine learning algorithms might trigger a special kind of re‐enchantment, making us comprehend less rather than more of shared human experience, and consequently altering the way we understand the administrative state and experience public life.",Modern law review,journal,2cba0d8a-bec0-49e1-bf6e-6cd5f329fe73,The Modern Law Review,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-10-08,"Eden Sarid, Omri Ben-Zvi","153899576, 1412373604",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003ac96deaefc09dee4446f9c10554fb09f6fba7,"Computer Science, Law, Political Science",153899576,['JournalArticle'],1.0,0.0

The Jucazinho Dam, built in 1998, emerged as a response to the scarcity of water in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil. After having less than 1% of its water storage capacity in 2016, the dam recovered in 2020 after interventions by the local water utility. In this context, the reliability of influent flow prediction models for dams becomes crucial for managers. This study proposed hydrological models based on artificial intelligence that aim to generate flow series, and we evaluated the adaptability of these models for the operation of the Jucazinho Dam. Data normalization between 0 and 1 was applied to avoid the predominance of variables with high values. The model was based on machine learning and employed support vector regression (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), as provided by the Python Sklearn library. The selection of the monitoring stations took place via the Brazilian National Water and Sanitation Agency’s (ANA) HIDROWEB portal, and we used Spearman’s correlation to identify the relationship between precipitation and flow. The evaluation of the performance of the model involved graphical analyses and statistical criteria such as the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the percentage of bias (PBIAS), the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean standard deviation ratio (RSR). The results of the statistical coefficients for the test data indicated unsatisfactory performance for long-term predictions (8, 16 and 32 days ahead), revealing a downward trend in the quality of the fit with an increase in the forecast horizon. The SVM model stood out by obtaining the best indices of NSE, PBIAS, R2 and RSR. The graphical results of the SVM models showed underestimation of the flow values with an increase in the forecast horizon due to the sensitivity of the SVM to complex patterns in the time series. On the other hand, the RF and ANN models showed hyperestimation of the flow values as the number of forecast days increased, which was mainly attributed to overfitting. In summary, this study highlights the relevance of artificial intelligence in flow prediction for the efficient management of dams, especially in water scarcity and data-scarce scenarios. A proper choice of models and the ensuring of reliable input data are crucial for obtaining accurate forecasts and can contribute to water security and the effective operation of dams such as Jucazinho.",Hydrology,journal,5dc07f39-44b5-44be-b79f-081977809832,Hydrology,Unknown,Unknown,,2024,2024-07-04,"Erickson Johny Galindo da Silva, Artur Paiva Coutinho, Jean Firmino Cardoso, Saulo de Tarso Marques Bezerra","2310193780, 2253481515, 2310050405, 94014125",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003b1449565f0afd675b7fb59f35693776eb2c77,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",2310193780,['JournalArticle'],2.0,17.0

Machine learning can be used in many applications such as face detection, speech recognition, medical diagnostics, statistical arbitrage, traffic prediction, etc. The traffic environment includes everything that can affect traffic on the road, whether it is traffic lights, accidents, rallies, or even road repairs that can cause congestion. If we have preconceived information very close to all of the above and the many everyday situations that can affect traffic, the driver or passenger can make an informed decision. It also helps with the future of automotive vehicles. In the present decades, traffic data has been massively generated, and we have moved towards big data concepts for transportation. The to be had site visitors glide forecasting strategies use a few site visitors’ prediction fashions and are nonetheless unsatisfactory to address real-global applications. It is lumbering to figure out the traffic flow precisely since the information accessible for the transportation framework is madly colossal. In this work, we arranged to utilize machine learning, genetic, soft computing, and deep learning algorithms to analyse the big-data for the transportation system with much-reduced complexity. Moreover, Image Processing algorithms are included in traffic sign recognition, which inevitably helps for the right training of autonomous vehicles. In economic years, Mobility GPS has become very popular in big cities in determining traffic percentage with the help of centralized traffic - server management. The data collected can be used to build an idea that displays the current traffic in the city and can be used in the future in predicting traffic and congestion analysis can be done",International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology,journal,100ffd12-b334-4f02-826b-8ac408e7df49,International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology,Unknown,Unknown,,2022,2022-09-30,"Akshata Jedhe, S.

A complex system has diverse observation features and complex internal structures, which have been difficult to study with regard to health condition estimation. To describe continuous and gradually changing time-based characteristics of a complex system’s health condition, this study develops a feature selection model based on the information amount and stability. Then, a reliability tree analysis model is designed according to the selected relevant features, the reliability tree is developed using expert knowledge, and the node weight is calculated by the correlation coefficient generated during the feature selection process. Using the simple recurrent unit (SRU), which is a time series machine learning algorithm that achieves a high operating efficiency, the results of the reliability tree analysis are combined to establish a tree-structure SRU (T-SRU) model for complex system health condition estimation. Finally, NASA turbofan engine data are used for verification.

The instruments used so far for dietary monitoring (eg, food frequency questionnaires, food diaries, and telephone interviews) are inexpensive and easy to implement but show important inaccuracies. Alternative methods based on wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated from these types of devices. Objective This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable estimate of caloric intake. Methods The study will capture four individual eating activities outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email, flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the University of Padova. Results The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high accuracy. Conclusions Building an automatic calculation method for caloric intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg, for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different segments of the population.

Due to the limitations of current diagnostic tools in these cases, novel approaches must be brought forward to improve treatment outcomes for these patients. The objective of this study was to develop a machine-learning-based software for primary cancer site prediction (OncoOrigin), based on genetic data acquired from tumor DNA sequencing. By design, this was an in silico diagnostic study, conducted using data from the cBioPortal database (accessed on 21 September 2024) and several data processing and machine learning Python libraries. The study involved over 20,000 tumor samples with information on patient age, sex, and the presence of genetic variants in over 600 genes. The main outcome of interest was machine-learning-based discrimination between cancer site classes. Model quality was assessed by training set cross-validation and evaluation on a segregated test set. Finally, the optimal model was incorporated with a graphical user interface into the OncoOrigin software. Feature importance for class discrimination was also determined on the optimal model. Out of the four tested machine learning estimators, the XGBoostClassifier-based model proved superior in test set evaluation, with a top-2 accuracy of 0.91 and ROC-AUC of 0.97. Unlike other machine learning models published in the literature, OncoOrigin stands out as the only one integrated with a graphical user interface, which is crucial for facilitating its use by oncology specialists in everyday clinical practice, where its application and implementation will have the greatest value in the future.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,Unknown,26,,2025,2025-03-01,"P.

Despite the growing knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction and ulcerative colitis (UC), the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in UC remains to be fully explored. Methods We integrated 1137 UC colon mucosal samples from 12 multicenter cohorts worldwide to create a normalized compendium. Differentially expressed mitochondria-related genes (DE-MiRGs) in individuals with UC were identified using the “Limma” R package. Unsupervised consensus clustering was utilized to determine the intrinsic subtypes of UC driven by DE-MiRGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to investigate module genes related to UC. Four machine learning algorithms were utilized for screening DE-MiRGs in UC and construct MiRGs diagnostic models. The models were developed utilizing the over-sampled training cohort, followed by validation in both the internal test cohort and the external validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Xcell and CIBERSORT algorithms, while potential biological mechanisms were explored through GSVA and GSEA algorithms. Hub genes were selected using the PPI network. Results The study identified 108 DE-MiRGs in the colonic mucosa of patients with UC compared to healthy controls, showing significant enrichment in pathways associated with mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation. The MiRGs diagnostic models for UC were constructed based on 17 signature genes identified through various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities. Utilizing the identified DE-MiRGs from the normalized compendium, 941 patients with UC were stratified into three subtypes characterized by distinct cellular and molecular profiles. Specifically, the metabolic subtype demonstrated enrichment in epithelial cells, the immune-inflamed subtype displayed high enrichment in antigen-presenting cells and pathways related to pro-inflammatory activation, and the transitional subtype exhibited moderate activation across all signaling pathways. Importantly, the immune-inflamed subtype exhibited a stronger correlation with superior response to four biologics: infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and golimumab compared to the metabolic subtype. Conclusion This analysis unveils the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune microenvironment in UC, thereby offering novel perspectives on the potential pathogenesis of UC and precision treatment of UC patients, and identifying new therapeutic targets.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,Unknown,15,,2024,2024-07-04,"Yi-fan Zhang, Meng-ying Fan, Qi-rui Bai, Rong Zhao, Shan Song, Li Wu, Jun-hui Lu, Jing-wei Liu, Qi Wang, Yuan Li, Xing Chen","2270958682, 2309982371, 2310040392, 2266167149, 2310320981, 2161944199, 2310188122, 2309962147, 2310246652, 2310440004, 2271219376",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e31ab99c90e5720ecd5fd6d74e672b887876c,"Biology, Environmental Science, Medicine",2270958682,['JournalArticle'],1.0,77.0

Tumors can have devastating implications if not accurately and promptly detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the methods frequently used to detect brain tumors owing to its excellent resolution. In the past few decades, substantial research has been conducted in the field of classifying brain images, ranging from traditional methods to deep-learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). To accomplish classification, machine-learning methods require manually created features. In contrast, CNN achieves classification by extracting visual features from unprocessed images. The size of the training dataset had a significant impact on the features that CNN extracts. The CNN tends to overfit when its size is small. Deep CNNs (DCNN) with transfer learning have therefore been developed. The aim of this work was to investigate the brain MR image categorization potential of pre-trained DCNN VGG-19, VGG-16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 models using data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Validation of the test set utilizing accuracy, recall, Precision, and F1 score showed that the pre-trained VGG-19 model with transfer learning exhibited the best performance.

Despite its widespread use across various fields, the extreme learning machine (ELM) also suffers from multicollinearity issues. To address this challenge, the ridge and Liu estimators, drawn from statistics literature, have been integrated into ELM theory, resulting in a notable advancement. This study aims to further enhance the capabilities of ridge and Liu estimators within the ELM framework by introducing two innovative two-parameter algorithms (TP1-ELM and TP2-ELM) that simultaneously incorporate both estimators. The proposed algorithms undergo comprehensive benchmarking against ELM, ELM-based algorithms, and other commonly used machine learning techniques across seven diverse datasets. Benchmark results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform both ELM-focused approaches and traditional machine learning algorithms on most datasets, yielding more generalizable and stable results. These findings suggest that the proposed algorithms offer a promising alternative to traditional machine learning techniques for regression and classification tasks, particularly in scenarios where multicollinearity is a concern.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,102355-102367,12,,2024,,Hasan Yıldırım,2238706836,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003fb578fc586082308689f125933f28cc5debc6,"Computer Science, Mathematics",2238706836,['JournalArticle'],0.0,68.0

As the sophistication of malware continues to increase, the demand for innovative approaches to improve detection capabilities become paramount. Machine learning/Deep learning models are being increasingly used for Malware Detection, however one of the most important and frequently overlooked aspects of building such models is feature encoding. This research paper explores the importance of feature encoding to improve the efficiency of threat detection and proposes a novel entropy-based encoding scheme for the categorical features present in the data extracted from malicious inputs. The KDDCUP99, UNSW-NB15 and CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 datasets have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encoding scheme. The results of the proposed encoding scheme are validated against seven other encoding schemes to ascertain the credibility and usability of the proposed scheme. The efficiency of the proposed system evaluated by applying different encoded versions of the datasets to train various machine learning models and determining the classification performance of the models on each dataset. The machine learning models trained with the proposed encoding scheme produced stable classification results and outperformed other encoding schemes when dimensionality reduction was applied on the data. The ensemble classifier trained using the proposed scheme was able to classify the data with an F1 score of 99.99% when the dimension-reduced entropy-encoded KDD Cup99 dataset was used to build the model. On the CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 dataset, the entropy encoding has exhibited a slightly improved classification parameters with the ensemble methods yielding a peak F1 score of 99.27%. We have also determined the feature importance values of the features present in the datasets to study the change in the contribution levels of the features when multiple categorical encoding schemes are applied upon the data.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,91187-91216,12,,2024,,"Vipin Das, B.

Currently, no specific clinical decision rules are available for OAT patients. The aim of the study was to identify which clinical risk factors easily identifiable at first ED evaluation may be associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in OAT patients who suffered an MTBI. Methods Three thousand fifty-four patients in OAT with MTBI from four Italian centers were retrospectively considered. A decision tree analysis using the classification and regression tree (CART) method was conducted to evaluate both the pre- and post-traumatic clinical risk factors most associated with the presence of post-traumatic ICH after MTBI and their possible role in determining the patient’s risk. The decision tree analysis used all clinical risk factors identified at the first ED evaluation as input predictor variables. Results ICH following MTBI was present in 9.5% of patients (290/3054). The CART model created a decision tree using 5 risk factors, post-traumatic amnesia, post-traumatic transitory loss of consciousness, greater trauma dynamic, GCS less than 15, evidence of trauma above the clavicles, capable of stratifying patients into different increasing levels of ICH risk (from 2.5 to 61.4%). The absence of concussion and neurological alteration at admission appears to significantly reduce the possible presence of ICH. Conclusions The machine-learning-based CART model identified distinct prognostic groups of patients with distinct outcomes according to on clinical risk factors. Decision trees can be useful as guidance in patient selection and risk stratification of patients in OAT with MTBI.",BMC Emergency Medicine,journal,f3c74b00-234d-45fc-89bd-c2099985b72b,BMC Emergency Medicine,Unknown,22,,2022,2022-03-24,"G.

In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking ‘big’ by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking ‘deep’ by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that ‘business travel’, which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,60447-60458,9,,2021,,"N.

This article, though, sheds some light on the actual differences that can be seen in how men and women drive. In this study, GPS-recorded driving dynamics data from 123 drivers, 48 women and 75 men, are analysed and drivers are categorised as aggressive, normal or gentle. A total of 10% of the drivers was categorised as aggressive, with an even distribution between the genders. For the gentle drivers, 11% of the drivers, the men dominated. The driving style investigation was extended to utilise machine learning, confirming the results from statistical tools. As driving style highly impacts a vehicle’s fuel consumption, while switching over to battery electric vehicles it is important to investigate how the different driving styles impact battery utilisation. Two Li-ion battery cell types were tested utilising the same load cycle with three levels of current amplitude, to represent accelerations for the three drive categories. While one cell type was insensitive to the current amplitude, the highly energy-optimised cell proved to be sensitive to higher current amplitudes, corresponding to a more aggressive driving style. Thus, the amplitude of the dynamic current can for some cells be a factor that needs to be considered for lifetime predictions, while it can be neglected for other cells.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,Unknown,Unknown,,2022,2022-09-16,"E.

However, managing optimal power generation for solar power plants has its own challenges. First comes the problem of work interruption and reduction in power generation. As the system must be tolerant to the faults, the relevance and significance of short-term forecasting of solar power generation becomes crucial. Within the framework of this research, the applicability of different forecasting methods for short-time forecasting is explained. The main goal of the research is to show an approach regarding how to make the forecast more accurate and overcome the above-mentioned challenges using opensource data as features. The data clustering algorithm based on KMeans is proposed to train unique models for specific groups of data samples to improve the generation forecast accuracy. Based on practical calculations, machine learning models based on Random Forest algorithm are selected which have been proven to have higher efficiency in predicting the generation of solar power plants.

This study explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and citizen engagement in improving road safety for vulnerable populations (pedestrians, cyclists) in Genoa, Italy. Aligned with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the project aims for a 50% reduction in traffic accidents by 2030.The AI4PublicPolicy initiative introduces the Virtual Policy Management Environment (VPME) platform. VPME utilizes ML, Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and chatbots to empower the policy development lifecycle. Citizen feedback is integrated through workshops and surveys, fostering a citizen-centric approach. The Genoa pilot program demonstrates VPME's capabilities. ML models analyse historical accident and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to predict future high-risk areas. These predictions inform resource allocation and targeted interventions for pedestrian crossings and school walking routes (""Pedibus""). Dashboards visualize the model outputs, allowing users to assess risk levels and predict accident occurrences. Future improvements include incorporating additional data sources (demographics, real-time traffic) for enhanced model accuracy. Citizen engagement played a vital role. Co-creation workshops facilitated stakeholder participation in defining Use Cases, User Stories, and project objectives. Discussions focused on integrating data from environmental, traffic, and citizen reporting systems with VPME solutions. Participants evaluated the project approach and provided valuable feedback. The project highlights the potential of AI and citizen collaboration for data-driven policymaking. This approach empowers municipalities to make informed decisions that prioritize public safety and well-being.

Diagnostic errors are an underappreciated cause of preventable mortality in hospitals and pose a risk for severe patient harm and increase hospital length of stay.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to explore the potential of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in improving diagnostic safety surveillance. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of the feasibility and potential to use electronic health records clinical notes and existing case review data.


METHODS
Safety Learning System case review data from 1 large health system composed of 10 hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from February 2016 to September 2021 were analyzed. The case review outcome included opportunities for improvement including diagnostic opportunities for improvement. To supplement case review data, electronic health record clinical notes were extracted and analyzed. A simple logistic regression model along with 3 forms of logistic regression models (ie, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Ridge, and Elastic Net) with regularization functions was trained on this data to compare classification performances in classifying patients who experienced diagnostic errors during hospitalization. Further, statistical tests were conducted to find significant differences between female and male patients who experienced diagnostic errors.


RESULTS
In total, 126 (7.4%) patients (of 1704) had been identified by case reviewers as having experienced at least 1 diagnostic error. Patients who had experienced diagnostic error were grouped by sex: 59 (7.1%) of the 830 women and 67 (7.7%) of the 874 men. Among the patients who experienced a diagnostic error, female patients were older (median 72, IQR 66-80 vs median 67, IQR 57-76; P=.02), had higher rates of being admitted through general or internal medicine (69.5% vs 47.8%; P=.01), lower rates of cardiovascular-related admitted diagnosis (11.9% vs 28.4%; P=.02), and lower rates of being admitted through neurology department (2.3% vs 13.4%; P=.04). The Ridge model achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.885), specificity (0.797), positive predictive value (PPV; 0.24), and F1-score (0.369) in classifying patients who were at higher risk of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing can be a potential solution to more effectively identifying and selecting potential diagnostic error cases for review and therefore reducing the case review burden.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,journal,2baad992-2268-4c38-9120-e453622f2eeb,Journal of medical Internet research,"

Remote monitoring frameworks for disease detection at an early stage are opposed by most conventional works. Even so, it ran into issues like increased operational complexity, higher resource costs, inaccurate predictions, longer data collection times, and a lower convergence rate. A remote health monitoring framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict heart disease and diabetes from medical datasets is the goal of this project. Patients' health data is collected via smart devices, and the resulting data is then combined using a variety of nodes, including a detection node, a visualisation node, and a prognostic node. People with long-term illnesses (such as the elderly and disabled) are in such greater demand than ever before that a new approach to healthcare delivery is essential. In the evolved paradigm, conventional physical medical services foundations like clinics, nursing homes, and long haul care offices will be old. Due to recent advancements in modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the smart healthcare system has become increasingly necessary (ML). This paper will discuss wearable and smartphone technologies, AI for medical diagnostics, and assistive structures, including social robots, that have been created for the surrounding upheld living climate. The review presents programming reconciliation structures that are urgent for consolidating information examination and other man-made consciousness instruments to develop brilliant medical care frameworks (AI).",International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication,journal,30f717c3-b4cb-461f-9152-25a2fc4208e8,International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-05-17,"Suresh Kallam, Prasun Chakrabarti, Bui Thanh Hung, S.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT. Materials and Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I–II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors. Results Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794–0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873–0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789–0.915), respectively.

Although CaOx crystallization inhibitors have been suggested as a therapeutic modality already decades ago, limited progress has been made in the discovery of potent molecules with efficacy in animal disease models. Herein, an image‐based machine learning approach to systematically screen chemically modified myo‐inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) analogues is utilized, which enables the identification of a highly active divalent inositol phosphate molecule. To date, this is the first molecule shown to completely inhibit the crystallization process in the nanomolar range, reduce crystal–cell interactions, thereby preventing CaOx‐induced transcriptomic changes, and decrease renal CaOx deposition and kidney injury in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria.

Although there are differences between insomnia and SD, they have similar symptoms and the same animal model. Currently, there is a lack of microarray data on insomnia. Therefore, for now, we are going to apply the SD data to insomnia. Although many studies have explained the possible mechanisms associated with insomnia, no previous studies have considered the key genes associated with insomnia or the relationship between insomnia and immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between key genes and immune cells by identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of insomnia. Next, we verified the efficacy of these biomarkers experimentally. Methods First, we downloaded four microarrays (GSE11755, GSE12624, GSE28750, and GSE48080) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 239 normal human blood samples and 365 blood specimens from patients with SD. Then, we analyzed two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model to investigate these key genes. Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not. Discussion In summary, we identified a key gene (C2CD2L) that may facilitate the development of biomarkers for insomnia.",Frontiers in Neurology,journal,3513ce18-3757-4358-b15f-7060af98e6d0,Frontiers in Neurology,Unknown,14,,2023,2023-11-28,"Qianfei Wang, Dong Liu, Tianci Gao, Yulei Tao, Xin Li, Yuan Liu, Zhiliang Liu, Jianqiang Mei, Fen-qiao Chen","1754116731, 2269175808, 2261798802, 2261896580, 2269321127, 2253506296, 2109097712, 2052119092, 1753972539",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00471583b7d751fc7043be63f18eaa4b25985bec,"Biology, Medicine",1754116731,['JournalArticle'],2.0,25.0

We developed a machine-learning model by using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) for this purpose, an approach that has not been used in any similar research. This research shows that the main difference between I4.0 and traditional industry is mostly observable in significantly better business performance of investment indicators, cost efficiency, technical equipment and market competitiveness. We identified 141 companies (1.97% of total analyzed sample) as potential users of I4.0, which makes up around 27% of total assets of the analyzed sample and around 26% of revenues.",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,journal,5bccd387-3836-42f2-9b60-9c190333ae01,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,Unknown,Unknown,,2022,2022-11-28,"Rajka Hrbić, Tomislav Grebenar","1581848615, 2205476726",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00473d62a795b9d56429e931ca326eda9c4d9121,"Business, Computer Science, Engineering",1581848615,,1.0,29.0

Abdelhamid, College of Computing & Information Technology, Shaqra University, Saudi Arabia. Email: Abdelaziz@cis.asu.edu.eg Abstract Academic advising is a crucial process in higher education and usually requires better understanding of student capabilities and curriculum structure to achieve its intended goals. Here, the authors propose a framework of integrated environment based on multi‐ agents to automate the full process of academic advising. The proposed framework consists of six agents namely, student agent, instructor agent, administrator agent, performance agent, schedule agent, and smart advisor agent. These agents are interacting together with the help of smart advisor agent, which manages the communication between them and provides smart advice based on machine learning techniques. In addition, the analysis of the proposed framework along with the deployment map is discussed by the authors. Moreover, a case study is presented in terms of a sample part of adaptive multi‐agent smart academic advising framework to demonstrate the workflow of the proposed approach.",IET Software,journal,fb4d95f0-46a7-4feb-b6fb-bffa7b98f19a,IET Softw.,293-307,15,,2021,2021-04-04,"A.

Various sources of information can be used to this end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of sequences is modest. Author summary When two protein families interact, their sequences feature statistical dependencies. First, interacting proteins tend to share a common evolutionary history. Second, maintaining structure and interactions through the course of evolution yields coevolution, detectable via correlations in the amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,PLOS Computational Biology,Unknown,19,,2022,2022-08-24,"C.

Efficient microplastic monitoring is imperative to understanding the long-term effects and progression of microplastic effects in the environment. Numerical models are valuable in studying microplastic transport as they can be used to examine the effects of different parameters systematically to help elucidate the fate and transport processes of microplastics, thus providing a holistic view of microplastics in the ocean environment. By incorporating physical parameters (such as size, shape, density, and identity of microplastics), numerical models have gained better understanding of the physics of microplastic transport, predicted sinking velocities more accurately, and estimated microplastic pathways in marine environments. However, availability of large amounts of information about microplastic physical and chemical parameters is sparse. Machine learning and computer-vision tools can aid in acquiring environmental information and provide input to develop more accurate models and verify their predictions. More accurate models can further the understanding of microplastic transport, facilitate monitoring efforts, and thus optimize where more data collection can take place to ultimately improve machine learning tools. This review offers a perspective on how image-based machine learning can be exploited to help uncover the physics of microplastic transport behaviors. Additionally, the authors hope the review inspires studies that can bridge the gap between numerical modeling and machine learning for microplastic analysis to exploit their joined potential.",Journal of Applied Physics,journal,ca503368-0618-4d11-aaeb-79d57f586f10,Journal of Applied Physics,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-01-14,"S.

However, the inference and learning problems in the Boltzmann machine are NP-hard. The investigation of an effective learning algorithm for the Boltzmann machine is one of the most important challenges in the field of statistical machine learning. In this paper, we study Boltzmann machine learning based on the (first-order) spatial Monte Carlo integration method, referred to as the 1-SMCI learning method, which was proposed in the author’s previous paper.

As with any machine learning implementation, the challenge on the utilization of MLPNN in rainfall forecasting lies in the development and evaluation of MLPNN models which delivers optimal forecasting performance. This research conducted performance analysis of MLPNN models through data preparation, model designing, and model evaluation in order to determine which parameters are the best-fit configurations for MLPNN model implementation in rainfall forecasting. During rainfall data preparation, imputation process and spatial correlation evaluation of weather variables from various weather stations showed that the geographical location of the chosen weather stations did not have a direct correlation between stations with respect to rainfall behavior leading to the decision of utilizing the weather station having the most complete weather data to be fed in the MLPNN. By conducting performance analysis of MLPNN models with different combinations of training algorithms, activation functions, learning rate, and momentum, it was found out that MLPNN model having 100 hidden neurons with Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm and Sigmoid activation function delivered the lowest RMSE of 0.031537 while another MLPNN model having the same number of hidden neurons, the same activation function but Resilient Propagation as training algorithm had the lowest MAE of 0.0209.

With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding. Methods The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit ≥ 18 years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features ( n  = 88) were selected with clinicians’ input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in > 0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. Results There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632–0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs.

The method for developing recommendations based on collaborative filtering such as Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and hybrid methods of Machine Learning (ML) has been improved. The paper describes the design principles and functional requirements to a recommendation system in the form of a Web application for choosing the content required by user using movies as an example. The research has focused on solving issues related to cold start and scalability within the method of collaborative filtering. To effectively address these tasks, we have used hybrid training methods. A hybrid recommendation system (HRS) has been practically implemented for providing relevant content recommendations using movies as an example, taking into consideration the user's personal preferences based on the constructed hybrid method. We have improved an algorithm for developing content recommendations based on the collaborative filtering and Machine Learning for the combined filtration of similarity indicators among users or goods. The hybrid algorithm receives initial information in a different form, normalizes it, and generates relevant recommendations based on a combination of CF and CBF methods. Machine Learning is capable of defining those factors that influence the selection of relevant films, which improves development of recommendations specific to the user. To solve these tasks, a new improved method has been proposed, underlying which, in contrast to existing systems of recommendations, are the hybrid methods and Machine Learning. Machine Learning data for the designed HRS were borrowed from MovieLens. We have analyzed methods for developing recommendations to the user; existing recommendation systems have been reviewed. Our experimental results demonstrate that the operational indicators for the proposed HRS, based on the technology of CF+CBF+ML, outperform those for two individual models, CF and CBF, and such their combinations as CF CBF, CF+ML, and CBF+ML. We recommend using HRS to collect data on people's preferences in selecting goods and to providing relevant recommendations.",Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,journal,405a8682-2b02-472d-9d89-0115f4e329bc,Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,Unknown,Unknown,,2019,2019-08-09,"V.

Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2 mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. The F1 scores and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.86, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.86, and 0.81, 0.77, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. The explanation of the model output based on SHAP values can provide a reference basis for medical physicists when adjusting the plan, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of treatment plans.Conclusion: It is feasible to use a machine learning method based on radiomics to establish a gamma pass rate classification prediction model for IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvis. The XGBoost model performs better in classification than the other three tree-based ensemble models, and global explanations and single-sample explanations of the model output through SHAP values may offer reference for medical physicists to provide high-quality plans, promoting the clinical application and implementation of GPR prediction models, and providing safe and efficient personalized QA management for patients.",Frontiers of Physics,journal,f0455aa5-b1f5-47b0-afdb-accda588a9c4,Frontiers in Physics,Unknown,Unknown,,2023,2023-08-10,"Q.

Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. Methods The multi-institutional PHIS+ clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children’s hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Results Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity . Conclusions NLP-based pneumonia information extraction of pediatric diagnostic imaging reports performed better than domain experts in this pilot study. NLP is an efficient method to extract information from a large collection of imaging reports to facilitate CER.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,journal,2baad992-2268-4c38-9120-e453622f2eeb,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Unknown,19,,2017,2017-05-01,"S.

However, they have strong relations since a longer processing time triggers a change in schedule. Although promising approaches already exist for mapping the influence of manufacturing processes on production scheduling, the variability of the production environment, including changing process conditions, technological parameters and the status of current orders, is usually ignored. For this reason, this paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that adaptively refines the production schedule by applying Machine Learning (ML)-models during the manufacturing process in order to predict the process-dependent parameters that influence the schedule. With the proper prediction of these parameters based on the process conditions, the production schedule is proactively adjusted to changing conditions not only to ensure the sufficient product quality but also to reduce the negative effects and losses that delayed rescheduling would cause. The proposed approach aims on minimizing the overall lateness by utilizing an active data exchange between the scheduling system and the predictive ML-models on the process level. The efficiency of the solution is demonstrated by a realistic case study using discrete event simulation.",MM Science Journal,journal,c4287a50-1d43-4821-8ab3-26d575809b6d,MM Science Journal,Unknown,Unknown,,2019,2019-11-13,"M.

Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance.

A reflection on a data-driven concept of health,"Through hypothetical scenarios, this paper analyses whether machine learning (ML) could resolve one of the main shortcomings present in Christopher Boorse’s Biostatistical Theory of health (BST). In doing so, it foregrounds the boundaries and challenges of employing ML in formulating a naturalist (i.e., prima facie value-free) definition of health. The paper argues that a sweeping dataist approach cannot fully make the BST truly naturalistic, as prior theories and values persist. It also points out that supervised learning introduces circularity, rendering it incompatible with a naturalistic perspective. Additionally, it underscores the need for pre-existing auxiliary theories to assess results from unsupervised learning. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the epistemological entanglements between data and data processing methods to manage expectations about what data patterns can predict. In conclusion, the paper argues against delegating the final authority for defining complex concepts like health to AI systems, as it necessitates ethical judgment and capacities for deliberation that AI currently lacks. It also warns against granting creators and deployers of AI systems the discretionary authority to determine these definitions outside the wider social discussion, advocating for ongoing public engagement on normative notions. Failure to do so risks limiting individuals and collectives’ ability to shape a just digital future and diminishes their fundamental epistemic agency.",Ethics and Information Technology,journal,09bb329a-45bc-4561-860f-c8ac0e958895,Ethics and Information Technology,1-12,26,,2023,2023-12-12,Ariel Guersenzvaig,2282850201,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004bbd2f00372355c5b4bf4085025c9c64de1ad2,"Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy",2282850201,['JournalArticle'],1.0,35.0

We constructed a pangenome of the respective genome assemblies and employed random forest algorithm to develop predictive models to identify gene clusters encoding metabolism, virulence, and antibiotic resistance that were associated with isolate source type. Comparison of genomes of all seafood-clinical isolates showed high balanced accuracy (≥0.80) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (≥0.87) for all of these functional features. Major virulence factors including tdh, trh, type III secretion system-related genes, and four alpha-hemolysin genes (hlyA, hlyB, hlyC, and hlyD) were identified as important differentiating factors in our seafood-clinical virulence model, underscoring the need for further investigation. Significant patterns for AMR genes differing among seafood and clinical samples were revealed from our model and genes conferring to tetracycline, elfamycin, and multidrug (phenicol antibiotic, diaminopyrimidine antibiotic, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic) resistance were identified as the top three key variables.

We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), and high (0.5 < z < 1.0). By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for ∼60%–70% of the host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of ∼80%–95%, depending on the redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve a disk precision of 96%/82%/79% and bulge precision of 90%/90%/80% (for the three redshift bins) at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of 30%/43%/42%. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging surveys.",Astrophysical Journal,journal,7652ece8-fbd3-4050-b927-cf29d7f0eaa8,The Astrophysical Journal,Unknown,944,,2022,2022-12-20,"Chuan Tian, C.

This work presents a method to project the data from some discrete sensory locations to the overall reactor domain during conduction cooldown scenarios similar to High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). The existing models for conductive cooldown in a heterogeneous multi-body system, such as an assembly of prismatic blocks or pebble beds relies on knowledge of the thermal contact conductance, requiring significant knowledge of local thermal contacts and heat transport possibilities across those contacts. With a priori knowledge of bulk geometry features and some discrete sensors, a machine learning approach was devised. The presented work uses an experimental facility to mimic conduction cooldown with an assembly of 68 cylindrical rods initially heated to 1200 K. High-fidelity temperature data were collected using an infrared (IR) camera to provide training data to the model and validate the predicted temperature data. The machine learning approach used here first converts the macroscopic bulk geometry information into Graph-Laplacian, and then uses the eigenvectors of the Graph-Laplacian to develop Kernel functions. Support vector regression (SVR) was implemented on the obtained Kernels and used to predict the thermal response in a packed rod assembly during a conduction cooldown experiment. The usage of SVR modeling differs from most models today because of its representation of thermal coupling between rods in the core. When trained with thermographic data, the average normalized error is less than 2% over 400 s, during which temperatures of the assembly have dropped by more than 500 K. The rod temperature prediction performance was significantly better for rods in the interior of the assembly compared to those near the exterior, likely due to the model simplification of the surroundings.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,Unknown,Unknown,,2022,2022-05-25,"M.

Recently, several efficient link prediction algorithms have been developed, demonstrating robust results in both prediction accuracy and interpretability. However, existing research has not clearly established the relationship between network characteristics and link creation mechanisms. The ability to predict complex networks with diverse features still requires further investigation. In light of this, we introduce a novel framework designed to combine the best features of different link prediction algorithms when applied to the network, with the aim of achieving more reliable predictions about how networks will evolve in consequence. According to the proposed framework, this first focuses on the feature extraction stage. During this phase, we systematically identify and extract a comprehensive set of features from the network before moving on to the classification phase. Here, we utilize state-of-the-art ensemble learning models to assess and classify potential links within the network. By training our Machine Learning (ML) models on the extracted features, we can effectively predict whether a particular link is likely to form (positive link) or unlikely to form (negative link). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: Twitch and Facebook. Additionally, we assessed their performance on these datasets by conducting specific preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning steps. This research makes a significant contribution to improving link prediction in dynamic social networks.",Journal of Advances in Information Technology,journal,f4784c7b-6592-49eb-a116-7290e0398868,Journal of Advances in Information Technology,Unknown,Unknown,,2025,,"Mohamed Badiy, Fatima Amounas, Mourade Azrour, Abdullah Alnajim, Abdulatif Alabdulatif, Sheroz Khan, Salma Bendaoud","2165409280, 2257021137, 34383536, 2292615146, 3412554, 2297446456, 120902465",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004cd6d5cc917a5149bf985daf80695c9ef52ffc,Computer Science,2165409280,['JournalArticle'],0.0,60.0

Such models quantitatively define how a biological system works based on causal relationships and use that cumulative biological knowledge to generate predictions and recommendations (in practice) and generate/evaluate hypotheses (in research). Their limitations revolve around obtaining sufficiently accurate inputs, user training and accuracy/precision of predictions on-farm. The new wave in digitalization technologies may negate some of these challenges. New data-driven (DD) modelling methods such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) examine patterns in data to produce accurate predictions (forecasting, classification of animals, etc.). The deluge of sensor data and new self-learning modelling techniques may address some of the limitations of traditional MM approaches - access to input data (e.g. sensors) and on-farm calibration. However, most of these new methods lack transparency in the reasoning behind predictions, in contrast to MM that have historically been used to translate knowledge into wisdom. The objective of this paper is to propose means to hybridize these two seemingly divergent methodologies to advance the models we use in animal production systems and support movement towards truly knowledge-based precision agriculture. In order to identify potential niches for models in animal production of the future, a cross-species (dairy, swine and poultry) examination of the current state of the art in MM and new DD methodologies (ML, DL analytics) is undertaken. We hypothesize that there are several ways via which synergy may be achieved to advance both our predictive capabilities and system understanding, being: (1) building and utilizing data streams (e.g. intake, rumination behaviour, rumen sensors, activity sensors, environmental sensors, cameras and near IR) to apply MM in real-time and/or with new resolution and capabilities; (2) hybridization of MM and DD approaches where, for example, a ML framework is augmented by MM-generated parameters or predicted outcomes and (3) hybridization of the MM and DD approaches, where biological bounds are placed on parameters within a MM framework, and the DD system parameterizes the MM for individual animals, farms or other such clusters of data. As animal systems modellers, we should expand our toolbox to explore new DD approaches and big data to find opportunities to increase understanding of biological systems, find new patterns in data and move the field towards intelligent, knowledge-based precision agriculture systems.",Animal,journal,3f1b5060-651e-424f-b1be-4bc3c0c052ae,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,"

In this work, we developed simulation models for different EV charging scenarios in the home sector. We used them to predict maximum demand based on the increasing penetration of EV consumers. We comprehensively reviewed the literature on EV charging technologies, battery capacity, charging situations, and the impact of EV loads. Our results suggest a method for visualizing the impact of EV charging loads by considering factors such as state of charge, arrival time, charging duration, rate of charge, maximum charging power, and involvement rate. This method can be used to model load profiles and determine the number of chargers needed to meet EV user demand. We also explored the use of a time-of-use (TOU) tariff as a demand response strategy, which encourages EV owners to charge their vehicles off-peak in order to avoid higher demand charges. Our simulation results show the effects of various charging conditions on load profiles and indicate that the current TOU price strategy can accommodate a 20% growth in EV consumers, while the alternative TOU price strategy can handle up to a 30% penetration level.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,,2023,2023-04-20 00:00:00,"Pramote Jaruwatanachai, Yod Sukamongkol, T.

Previous studies have sought to identify the various factors influencing EV charging patterns to deploy an appropriate charging infrastructure. However, limited attention has been paid to the investigation of different charging patterns identified in different regions at different phases of the EV program. This study aims to fill this research gap in the literature by developing binary logistic models that account for the factors influencing charging demands in different regions of Korea, i.e., Jeju-do and Gangneung-si. To this end, we collected historical data on EV charging transactions in these study regions and analyzed them to evaluate the difference in charging demands. The developed models suggest that the charging demand varies with charger characteristics and charging time. Moreover, different charging patterns in different regions can be explained by the different travel behaviors of those who use EVs for different trip purposes. These findings provide an important implication suggesting that policymakers should consider a stepwise strategy to construct charging infrastructure at the appropriate scale and configuration, depending on the phase of the EV program.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2023,2023-03-15 00:00:00,"Dae-yun Kim, Doyun Kwon, Jihoon Han, S.

This study identifies user behavioral patterns by analyzing data from more than 7000 charging stations in Canada, comparing residential vs. public Level 2, and public direct current fast (DCFC) vs. public Level 2 charging. A novel algorithm, CHAODA, was applied to identify differences between DCFC and other Level 2 charging options. Through a multivariate and holistic methodology, various patterns emerge, identifying differences in the utilization and seasonality of different EVSE types.

While various governments promote EVs, people feel “range anxiety” because of their limited driving range or charge capacity. A limited number of charging stations are available, which results in a strong demand for predicting energy consumed by EVs. In this paper, machine learning (ML) models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to investigate the total energy consumption (TEC) by the EVs. The independent variables used for the study include changing real-life situations or external parameters, such as trip distance, tire type, driving style, power, odometer reading, EV model, city, motorway, country roads, air conditioning, and park heating. We compared the ML models’ performance along with the error analysis. A pairwise correlation study showed that trip distance has a high correlation coefficient (0.87) with TEC. XGBoost had better prediction accuracy (~92%) or R2 (0.92). Trip distance, power, heating, and odometer reading were the most important features influencing the TEC, identified using the shapley additive explanations method.",World Electric Vehicle Journal,journal,6fc2b7b5-0526-4df5-b942-b1b93f3cf248,World Electric Vehicle Journal,,,,2021,2021-06-29 00:00:00,"Sugam Pokharel, Pradip Sah, Deepak Ganta","2128916182, 2129350920, 1621181211",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bf43099563822c04eb58e6ac7c745680eafcbe7,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science, Mathematics",2128916182,,28.0,24.0

Generally, monitoring energy consumption has become one of the most important factors in green and micro grids; therefore, predicting the charging demand of PEVs (the energy consumed during the charging session) could help to efficiently manage the electric grid. Consequently, three machine learning methods are applied in this research to predict the charging demand for the PEV user after a charging session starts. This approach is validated using a dataset consisting of seven years of charging events collected from public charging stations in the state of Nebraska, USA. The results show that the regression method, XGBoost, slightly outperforms the other methods in predicting the charging demand, with an RMSE equal to 6.68 kWh and R2 equal to 51.9%. The relative importance of input variables is also discussed, showing that the user’s historical average demand has the most predictive value. Accurate prediction of session charging demand, as opposed to the daily or hourly demand of multiple users, has many possible applications for utility companies and charging networks, including scheduling, grid stability, and smart grid integration.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,,2020,2020-08-16 00:00:00,"Ahmad Almaghrebi, Fares Aljuheshi, Mostafa Rafaie, Kevin James, M.

In apartment complexes, which have emerged as a common residential type in metropolitan areas and highly populated districts, high charging demand could result in substantial stress to distribution networks. In this work, the effect of EV charging power demand in an apartment complex on the aging of the Distribution Transformer (DT) is studied. A methodology based on the stochastic characterization of vehicle usage profiles and user charging patterns is developed to obtain realistic EV charging demand profiles. Based on the modeled EV charging profile and the transformer thermal model, the effect of different EV penetration ratios on DT aging for an apartment complex in the Republic of Korea is studied. Results for an EV penetration ratio of up to 30% indicated that DT aging could be accelerated by up to 40%, compared to the case without EV charging. To mitigate this accelerated DT aging caused by EV charging, the effectiveness of two integration approaches of Photovoltaic (PV) sources was studied. Based on a case study that included a realistic PV generation profile, it was demonstrated that a significant contribution to DT reliability could be achieved via the operation of PV sources. A more apparent contribution of PV integration was observed with an energy storage installation at higher EV penetration ratios. At an EV penetration ratio of 30%, a maximum decrease of 41.8% in the loss-of-life probability of the DT was achieved. The effects of different PV integration approaches and power management details on DT aging were also studied. The results demonstrate that the EV charging demand could introduce a significant level of stress to DTs and that this impact can be effectively mitigated by installing PV sources. These observations are expected to contribute toward the effective planning of power system infrastructures that support the design of sustainable cities with the widespread use of EVs.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,,2020,2020-05-19 00:00:00,"Shin-Ki Hong, S.

Despite growing research in this area and an increasing number of interventions designed to improve psychological well-being, the field lacks a unifying framework that clarifies the dimensions of human flourishing that can be cultivated. Here, we integrate evidence from well-being research, cognitive and affective neuroscience, and clinical psychology to highlight four core dimensions of well-being—awareness, connection, insight, and purpose. We discuss the importance of each dimension for psychological well-being, identify mechanisms that underlie their cultivation, and present evidence of their neural and psychological plasticity. This synthesis highlights key insights, as well as important gaps, in the scientific understanding of well-being and how it may be cultivated, thus highlighting future research directions.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,journal,bb95bf2e-8383-4748-bf9d-d6906d091085,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,32197 - 32206,117,,2020,2020-12-07 00:00:00,"Cortland J.

Methods Individual patient data from all six eligible randomised controlled trials were used to develop (k = 3, n = 1722) and test (k = 3, n = 918) nine models. Predictors included depressive and anxiety symptoms, social support, life events and alcohol use. Weighted sum scores were developed using coefficient weights derived from network centrality statistics (models 1–3) and factor loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (model 4). Unweighted sum score models were tested using elastic net regularised (ENR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression (models 5 and 6). Individual items were then included in ENR and OLS (models 7 and 8). All models were compared to one another and to a null model (mean post-baseline Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) score in the training data: model 9). Primary outcome: BDI-II scores at 3–4 months. Results Models 1–7 all outperformed the null model and model 8. Model performance was very similar across models 1–6, meaning that differential weights applied to the baseline sum scores had little impact. Conclusions Any of the modelling techniques (models 1–7) could be used to inform prognostic predictions for depressed adults with differences in the proportions of patients reaching remission based on the predicted severity of depressive symptoms post-treatment. However, the majority of variance in prognosis remained unexplained. It may be necessary to include a broader range of biopsychosocial variables to better adjudicate between competing models, and to derive models with greater clinical utility for treatment-seeking adults with depression.",Psychological Medicine,journal,d45c1b1e-6745-4ce0-8110-f3a53cf52d6e,Psychological Medicine,408 - 418,53,,2020,2020-11-23 00:00:00,"J.

One of the most challenging problems in cloud computing is detecting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The attack detection framework for the DDoS attack is tricky because of its nonlinear nature of interruption activities, atypical system traffic behaviour, and many features in the problem space. As a result, creating defensive solutions against these attacks is critical for mainstream cloud computing adoption. In this novel research, by using performance parameters, perplexed-based classifiers with and without feature selection will be compared with the existing machine learning algorithms such as naïve Bayes and random forest to prove the efficacy of the perplexed-based classification algorithm. Comparing the performance parameters like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, the proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 99%, which is higher than the existing algorithms, proving that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in detecting the DDoS attacks in cloud computing systems. To extend our research in the area of nature-inspired computing, we compared our perplexed Bayes classifier feature selection with nature-inspired feature selection like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and found that our classifier is highly efficient in comparison with GA and PSO and their accuracies are 2% and 8%, respectively, less than those of perplexed Bayes classifier.",Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,journal,f32b7322-b69c-4e63-801d-8f50784ef778,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,2022,,2022,2022-07-19 00:00:00,"N.

Inspired by nonequilibrium statistical physics, these models can generate 3D molecular structures with specific properties or requirements crucial to drug discovery. Diffusion models were particularly successful at learning the complex probability distributions of 3D molecular geometries and their corresponding chemical and physical properties through forward and reverse diffusion processes. This review focuses on the technical implementation of diffusion models tailored for 3D molecular generation. It compares the performance, evaluation methods, and implementation details of various diffusion models used for molecular generation tasks. We cover strategies for atom and bond representation, architectures of reverse diffusion denoising networks, and challenges associated with generating stable 3D molecular structures. This review also explores the applications of diffusion models in de novo drug design and related areas of computational chemistry, such as structure-based drug design, including target-specific molecular generation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics of protein–ligand complexes. We also cover conditional generation on physical properties, conformation generation, and fragment-based drug design.

Phys. 22, 7169 (2020)] as an automated driver for calculations at the extended tight-binding level (xTB), it offers a variety of molecular- and metadynamics simulations, geometry optimization, and molecular structure analysis capabilities. Implemented algorithms include automated procedures for conformational sampling, explicit solvation studies, the calculation of absolute molecular entropy, and the identification of molecular protonation and deprotonation sites. Calculations are set up to run concurrently, providing efficient single-node parallelization. CREST is designed to require minimal user input and comes with an implementation of the GFNn-xTB Hamiltonians and the GFN-FF force-field. Furthermore, interfaces to any quantum chemistry and force-field software can easily be created. In this article, we present recent developments in the CREST code and show a selection of applications for the most important features of the program. An important novelty is the refactored calculation backend, which provides significant speed-up for sampling of small or medium-sized drug molecules and allows for more sophisticated setups, for example, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and minimum energy crossing point calculations.",Journal of Chemical Physics,journal,1bb63b2b-3f57-4387-aaf6-b2a33dfcdcc5,The Journal of chemical physics,,160 11,,2024,2024-03-21 00:00:00,"Philipp Pracht, S.

We demonstrate GaUDI’s effectiveness in designing molecules for organic electronic applications by using single- and multiple-objective tasks applied to a generated dataset of 475,000 polycyclic aromatic systems. GaUDI shows improved conditional design, generating molecules with optimal properties and even going beyond the original distribution to suggest better molecules than those in the dataset. In addition to point-wise targets, GaUDI can also be guided toward open-ended targets (for example, a minimum or maximum) and in all cases achieves close to 100% validity of generated molecules.

Recently, machine learning (ML) models have shown remarkable performance for prediction of TS geometries. However, they require 3D conformations of reactants and products often with their appropriate orientations as input, which demands substantial efforts and computational cost. Here, we propose a generative approach based on the stochastic diffusion method, namely TSDiff, for prediction of TS geometries just from 2D molecular graphs. TSDiff outperforms the existing ML models with 3D geometries in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it enables to sample various TS conformations, because it learns the distribution of TS geometries for diverse reactions in training. Thus, TSDiff finds more favorable reaction pathways with lower barrier heights than those in the reference database. These results demonstrate that TSDiff shows promising potential for an efficient and reliable TS exploration.

Previous shallow learning and deep learning strategies adopt the single learning model approach for intrusion detection. The single learning model approach may experience problems to understand increasingly complicated data distribution of intrusion patterns. Particularly, the single deep learning model may not be effective to capture unique patterns from intrusive attacks having a small number of samples. In order to further enhance the performance of machine learning based IDS, we propose the Big Data based Hierarchical Deep Learning System (BDHDLS). BDHDLS utilizes behavioral features and content features to understand both network traffic characteristics and information stored in the payload. Each deep learning model in the BDHDLS concentrates its efforts to learn the unique data distribution in one cluster. This strategy can increase the detection rate of intrusive attacks as compared to the previous single learning model approaches. Based on parallel training strategy and big data techniques, the model construction time of BDHDLS is reduced substantially when multiple machines are deployed.",Big Data Mining and Analytics,journal,fa31ff53-6717-46c5-934d-9f21c27f96ba,Big Data Min.

Recent studies have applied conventional machine learning to network attack detection by learning the patterns of the network behaviors and training a classification model. These models usually require large labeled datasets; however, the rapid pace and unpredictability of cyber attacks make this labeling impossible in real time. To address these problems, we proposed utilizing transfer learning for detecting new and unseen attacks by transferring the knowledge of the known attacks. In our previous work, we have proposed a transfer learning-enabled framework and approach, called HeTL, which can find the common latent subspace of two different attacks and learn an optimized representation, which was invariant to attack behaviors’ changes. However, HeTL relied on manual pre-settings of hyper-parameters such as relativeness between the source and target attacks. In this paper, we extended this study by proposing a clustering-enhanced transfer learning approach, called CeHTL, which can automatically find the relation between the new attack and known attack. We evaluated these approaches by stimulating scenarios where the testing dataset contains different attack types or subtypes from the training set. We chose several conventional classification models such as decision trees, random forests, KNN, and other novel transfer learning approaches as strong baselines. Results showed that proposed HeTL and CeHTL improved the performance remarkably. CeHTL performed best, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in detecting new network attacks.",EURASIP Journal on Information Security,journal,885ece6c-fb93-402d-853f-d7ba96a7ba66,EURASIP Journal on Information Security,,2019,,2019,2019-02-21 00:00:00,"Juan Zhao, S.

In this paper, we explore how to model an intrusion detection system based on deep learning, and we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS). Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the performance of the proposed model. We compare it with those of J48, artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and other machine learning methods proposed by previous researchers on the benchmark data set. The experimental results show that RNN-IDS is very suitable for modeling a classification model with high accuracy and that its performance is superior to that of traditional machine learning classification methods in both binary and multiclass classification.

This paper proposes a new facial emotional recognition model using a convolutional neural network. Our proposed model, “ConvNet”, detects seven specific emotions from image data including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise. The features extracted by the Local Binary Pattern (LBP), region based Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) and Convolutional Neural network (CNN) from facial expressions images were fused to develop the classification model through training by our proposed CNN model (ConvNet). Our method can converge quickly and achieves good performance which the authors can develop a real-time schema that can easily fit the model and sense emotions. Furthermore, this study focuses on the mental or emotional stuff of a man or woman using the behavioral aspects. To complete the training of the CNN network model, we use the FER2013 databases at first, and then apply the generalization techniques to the JAFFE and CK+ datasets respectively in the testing stage to evaluate the performance of the model. In the generalization approach on the JAFFE dataset, we get a 92.05% accuracy, while on the CK+ dataset, we acquire a 98.13% accuracy which achieve the best performance among existing methods. We also test the system’s success by identifying facial expressions in real-time. ConvNet consists of four layers of convolution together with two fully connected layers. The experimental results show that the ConvNet is able to achieve 96% training accuracy which is much better than current existing models. However, when compared to other validation methods, the suggested technique was more accurate. ConvNet also achieved validation accuracy of 91.01% for the FER2013 dataset.

The existing student behavior recognition methods mainly focus on the behavior of the single student and have low performance and efficiency. To recognize the behaviors of multiple students in the classroom at the same time, we propose a fast and effective solution, called ET-YOLOv5s, which is an improved YOLOv5s with ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) and a tiny object detection module in this paper. First, the ESRGAN is adopted to generate high-definition images from original images of real classroom environments in colleges to improve the recognition accuracy. Then a tiny object detection module is added to the YOLOv5s to detect the smaller objects on high-definition images, such as phones, books, and students sitting at the back of the classroom. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed solution can detect 11 kinds of students’ behaviors in classrooms, including playing mobile phones, having class, sitting with hands on face, sitting turn right, sitting turn left, bowing, sleeping, and so on.

In this context, new implant materials and coatings that deal with medical device-associated complications are required. Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory materials are also required for wound healing applications, especially in diabetic patients with chronic wounds. In this work, we present hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels with triple activity: antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and miRNA delivery agent. We demonstrate that polyarginine with a degree of polymerization of 30 (PAR30), which was previously shown to have a prolonged antibacterial activity, decreases inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated macrophages. In addition, PAR30 accelerated fibroblast migration in macrophage/fibroblast co-culture system, suggesting a positive effect on wound healing. Furthermore, PAR30 allowed to load miRNA into HA hydrogels, and then to deliver them into the cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first describing miRNA-loaded hydrogels with antibacterial effect and anti-inflammatory features. Such system can become a tool for the treatment of infected wounds, e.g. diabetic ulcers, as well as for foreign body response modulation. This article is protected by copyright.

Even though the mechanisms of LbL film development are well-established, currently there are no predictive models that can link film components with their final properties. The current health crisis has shown the importance of accelerated development of biomedical solutions such as antiviral coatings, and the implementation of machine learning methodologies for coating development can enable achieving this. In this work, using literature data and newly generated experimental results, we first analyzed the relative impact of 23 coating parameters on the coating thickness. Next, a predictive model has been developed using aforementioned parameters and molecular descriptors of polymers from the DeepChem library. Model performance was limited because of insufficient number of data points in the training set, due to the scarce availability of data in the literature. Despite this limitation, we demonstrate, for the first time, utilization of machine learning for prediction of LbL coating properties. It can decrease the time necessary to obtain functional coating with desired properties, as well as decrease experimental costs and enable the fast first response to crisis situations (such as pandemics) where coatings can positively contribute. Besides coating thickness, which was selected as an output value in this study, machine learning approach can be potentially used to predict functional properties of multilayer coatings, e.g. biocompatibility, cell adhesive, antibacterial, antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,,2021,2021-09-21 00:00:00,"V.

When HyA of the desired molecular weight is implanted into the human body for regeneration of damaged tissue, it is degraded by hyaluronidase in associated with an inflammatory response. This study sought to evaluate the effects of HyA molecular weight and concentration on pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in murine macrophages. The structures and molecular weights of HyAs (LMW-10, MMW-100, MMW-500, and HMW-1,500) were confirmed by 1 H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), respectively. After treatment of murine macrophages with a low (10 µg/mL) or high (100 µg/mL) concentration of each molecular weight HyA, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and changes in immune response in both LPS-stimulated and untreated macrophages were evaluated by assessing nitric oxide (NO) production, and analyzing expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes including by RT-PCR. Molecular weights of LMW-10, MMW-100, MMW-500, and HMW-1,500 were 13,241 ± 161, 96,531 ± 1,167, 512,657 ± 8,545, and 1,249,500 ± 37,477 Da, respectively. NO production by LPS-stimulated macrophages was decreased by increasing concentrations and molecular weights of HyA. At a high concentration of 100 µg/mL, HMW-1,500 reduced NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages to about 45 %. Using NanoString technology, we also found that the immune-related genes TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-11, CCL2, and Arg1 were specifically over-expressed in LPS-stimulated macrophages treated with various molecular weights of HyA. An RT-PCR analysis of gene expression showed that HMW-1,500 decreased expression of classically activated (M1) macrophage genes, such as TNF‐α, IL-6, CCL2, and IL-1β, in LPS-stimulated macrophages, whereas medium molecular-weight HyA (MMW-100 and MMW-500) instead increased expression levels of these genes. HMW-1,500 at a high concentration (100 µg/mL) significantly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Expression of genes associated with anti-inflammatory responses (M2 phenotype), such as TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-11, and Arg1, were increased by high concentrations of MMW-500 and HMW-1,500 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. High molecular-weight HyA (i.e., > 1,250 kDa) inhibits pro-inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages and induces anti-inflammatory responses in a concentration dependent manner.",Biomaterials Research,journal,123b5caf-1ba4-48cc-937f-05ac75234c32,Biomaterials Research,,25,,2021,2021-06-28 00:00:00,"Bo Mi Lee, S.

The study aims to clarify the macrophage heterogeneity and phenotype dynamics, and pinpoint critical targets within efferocytosis in DKD. Methods Utilizing early human DKD sequencing data, we computed the potential communication between leukocytes and renal intrinsic cells. Subsequently, we scrutinized the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from CD45-enriched immune cells, concentrating on the macrophage subsets in DKD. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was conducted to explore cell development. Differential expression genes (DEGs) from macrophage subgroups and bulk RNA-sequencing were used to identify shared hub genes. The NephroseqV5 platform was employed to evaluate the clinical significance, and the expression of key molecules was validated in DKD tissues. Results Macrophage infiltration rose in DKD, causing inflammation through the release of chemokines. As time progressed, the number of resident macrophages substantially dropped, with diminishing M1-like and increasing M2-like phenotypes relative to early stages. Further analysis pointed to the most enrichment of macrophage function is the phagosome. We overlapped the DEGs with efferocytosis-related genes and identified key genes, including CD36, ITGAM, and CX3CR1, which exhibited significant correlations with macrophages and T cells. The Nephroseq database revealed that they are associated with proteinuria and renal function. Consistent with the validation set, in vivo experiments verified elevated expression levels of key molecules. Conclusions In essence, our research elucidated the dynamics in macrophage subtype transitions. It emphasized three pivotal genes as critical modulators of macrophage efferocytosis in DKD, indicating their potential as innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,16,,2025,2025-02-19 00:00:00,"Binshan Zhang, Yunqi Wu, Zhongli Wang, Suhua Gao, Hongyan Liu, Yao Lin, Pei Yu","2334735633, 2306834116, 2334581284, 2339422376, 2115669246, 2149202194, 2271660714",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61e5330e744545c8b4c92f51c818223acaa277df,"Biology, Medicine",2334735633,['JournalArticle'],1.0,54.0

Using a combination of bioinformatics and biological assays, this study conducted an in-depth investigation of the effects of 34. The results of this study have substantial implications for cancer research and treatment. 34 has shown remarkable efficacy in inhibiting the growth of several cancer cell lines, including those representing prostate carcinoma (PC3) and cervical carcinoma (HeLa). The high sensitivity of these cells, indicated by low IC50 values, underscores its potential as a promising chemotherapeutic agent. In addition, 34 has revealed the ability to induce cell cycle arrest, particularly in the G2/M phase, a phenomenon with critical implications for tumor initiation and growth. By interfering with DNA replication in cancer cells, 34 has shown the capacity to trigger cell death, offering a new avenue for cancer treatment. In addition, computational analyses have identified key genes affected by 34 treatment, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. These genes are involved in critical biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication and microtubule dynamics, all of which are central to cancer development and progression.

However, a comprehensive study has not yet been undertaken examining the immunological and predictive effects of TUBA1B in a pan-carcinoma context. Using data from TCGA, GEO, and other databases, we analyzed TUBA1B expression across various carcinoma types using transcriptional profiling, prognostic implications, genetic and epigenetic alterations, methylation patterns, and immunological significance. To validate our findings, we conducted Western blot analysis to assess TUBA1B protein levels in matched breast cancer tissue samples and performed CCK-8 proliferation assay, flow cytometry, transwell invasion, and migration assays to comprehensively examine the functional impact of TUBA1B on breast cancer cells. Our pan-cancer analysis found TUBA1B upregulation across most tumor types, with varying expression patterns in distinct immune and molecular subtypes. High TUBA1B expression was an independent risk factor and associated with poor prognoses in several cancers, including BRCA, KICH, LGG, LUAD, and MESO. TUBA1B also demonstrates moderate to high diagnostic accuracy in most tumor types. Increased m6A methylation levels were observed in the TUBA1B gene, while its promoter region displayed low methylation levels. TUBA1B's expression impacted some cancers by elevating tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, neoantigen formation, immune cell infiltration, and the modulation of immune checkpoints. Functional enrichment analysis highlights TUBA1B’s involvement in important cellular processes such as the cell cycle, p53 signaling, cell senescence, programmed cell death, and the regulation of immune-related pathways. Moreover, our study reveals higher TUBA1B protein expression in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent tissues. In vitro experiments confirm that TUBA1B deletion reduces breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while increasing apoptosis. In conclusion, our study suggests that TUBA1B could potentially serve as a diagnostic marker for predicting cancer immunological profiles and survival outcomes and shed light on the expression and role of TUBA1B in breast cancer, providing a solid foundation for considering it as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer patient treatment.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,14,,2024,2024-04-08 00:00:00,"Yiyang Wang, Yongxiang Li, Yubo Jing, Yuqi Yang, Haiyang Wang, Dilimulati Ismtula, Chenming Guo","2175083230, 2275278432, 2295773643, 2295843376, 2290437613, 2174195328, 2115610836",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a2fedfc6c4216151003b51e800bdf0184033942b,"Biology, Medicine",2175083230,['JournalArticle'],11.0,49.0

The aim of this investigation is to assess the potential application of tubulin alpha-1b (TUBA1B) as a biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring the outcome of LUAD. Methods: The clinical data of the LUAD patients was retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of a tissue microarray containing 90 LUAD cases was implemented to examine the expression of TUBA1B. The protein and mRNA levels of TUBA1B in serum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis respectively. UALCAN was employed to confirm the expression levels and survival probability of TUBA1B in LUAD patients. Results: Compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues in the microarray, the expression of TUBA1B in LUAD tissues was much higher. The expression of TUBA1B in LUAD was statistically correlated with lymph node status (P = .031). Moreover, patients with higher TUBA1B expression had shorter overall survival (P < .0001). Furthermore, cox multi-factor analysis also suggested that TUBA1B may be an independent predictor for LUAD prognosis (P = .030). The results of TCGA data analysis by UALCAN were consistent with the microarray results, except for that TUBA1B was also significantly correlated with clinical tumor stages. Protein levels of TUBA1B in serum were obviously elevated in LUAD patients than control (P < .0001), and the area under the ROC curve was 0.99. TUBA1B also showed better sensitivity of 92.9% for LUAD than common clinical biomarkers. Conclusion: TUBA1B may be a non-invasive prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for LUAD patients.",Technology in Cancer Research and Treatment,journal,9cb37bbb-4afe-4b5c-a724-55af5100ed9c,Technology in Cancer Research & Treatment,,22,,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,"Xuena Pang, Hongfei Du, Fang Nie, Xiangchou Yang, Ying Xu","1998853972, 11239455, 2064288196, 13744338, 2118669781",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c53b85afb37a93787771aafcfc3d801c0c62f4a0,Medicine,1998853972,['JournalArticle'],3.0,41.0

The conventional treatment of PAAD shows poor results, and patients have poor prognosis. The synthesis and degradation of proteins are essential for the occurrence and development of tumors. Aggrephagy is a type of autophagy that selectively degrades aggregated proteins. It decreases the formation of aggregates by degrading proteins, thus reducing the harm to cells. By breaking down proteins, it decreases the formation of aggregates; thus, minimizing damage to cells. For evaluating the response to immunotherapy and prognosis in PAAD patients, in this study, we developed a reliable signature based on aggrephagy-related genes (ARGs). We obtained 298 AGGLncRNAs. Based on the results of one-way Cox and LASSO analyses, the lncRNA signature was constructed. In the risk model, the prognosis of patients in the low-risk group was noticeably better than that of the patients in the high-risk group. Additionally, the ROC curves and nomograms validated the capacity of the risk model to predict the prognosis of PAAD. The patients in the low-risk and high-risk groups showed considerable variations in functional enrichment and immunological analysis. Regarding drug sensitivity, the low-risk and high-risk groups had different half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50).",Genes,journal,3a435ff9-d0c3-4eb9-9a89-992c0f8bf398,Genes,,14,,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,"Xueyuan Huang, Hao Chi, S.

Combined with the acquired resistance to standard treatments and recurrence, GBM is an especially deadly malignancy with hardly any worthwhile treatment options. The treatment resistance of GBM is influenced, in large part, by the contributions from two main degradative pathways in eukaryotic cells: ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. These two systems influence GBM cell survival by removing and recycling cellular components that have been damaged by treatments, as well as by modulating metabolism and selective degradation of components of cell survival or cell death pathways. There has recently been a large amount of interest in potential cancer therapies involving modulation of UPS or autophagy pathways. There is significant crosstalk between the two systems that pose therapeutic challenges, including utilization of ubiquitin signaling, the degradation of components of one system by the other, and compensatory activation of autophagy in the case of proteasome inhibition for GBM cell survival and proliferation. There are several important regulatory nodes which have functions affecting both systems. There are various molecular components at the intersections of UPS and autophagy pathways that pose challenges but also show some new therapeutic opportunities for GBM. This review article aims to provide an overview of the recent advancements in research regarding the intersections of UPS and autophagy with relevance to finding novel GBM treatment opportunities, especially for combating GBM treatment resistance.",Cells,journal,51278f27-cfdd-4938-81e4-9d54ca7b3cd0,Cells,,11,,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,"Rhett Visintin, S.

However, its function as a significant biomarker for the prognosis of immunotherapy in pan-cancer remains unclear. This study aims at assessing the role of TUBA1C in pan-cancer at multiple levels, including mutations, gene expression, methylation, m6A methylation, and immune cell infiltration levels. Data retrieved from major public databases, such as TCGA, GEO, GTEx, GSCA, CancerSEA, HPA, and RNAactDrugs, revealed that TUBA1C expression was high in 33 cancer types. Survival analysis revealed that TUBA1C was a poor prognostic factor for 12 tumour types, and mutations, CNVs, and methylation affected the prognosis of some cancer types. Furthermore, TUBA1C was found to be related to immune-related genes, immune cell infiltration, and the immune microenvironment. In addition, the sensitivity of 10 anticancer drugs was associated with high TUBA1C expression.

Material and methods We used two publicly available datasets of postero-anterior chest radiographs, which are from Montgomery County, Maryland, and Shenzhen, China. A CNN (ConvNet) from scratch was trained to automatically detect TB on chest radiographs. Also, a CNN-based transfer learning approach using five different pre-trained models, including Inception_v3, Xception, ResNet50, VGG19, and VGG16 was utilized for classifying TB and normal cases from CXR images. The performance of models for testing datasets was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, precision, area under curve (AUC), and F1-score. Results All proposed models provided an acceptable accuracy for two-class classification. Our proposed CNN architecture (i.e., ConvNet) achieved 88.0% precision, 87.0% sensitivity, 87.0% F1-score, 87.0% accuracy, and AUC of 87.0%, which was slightly less than the pre-trained models.

Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics.

Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized‐stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized‐stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3‐year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer.

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2‐fold to 3‐fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2‐fold for men and little for women.

Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar using the MeSH compliant and other keywords that included prostate cancer, PSA, mpMRI, PET CT, PET/MRI. Conclusions mpMRI has now established itself as the gold-standard of local prostate imaging and has been incorporated into international guidelines as part of the diagnostic work-up of prostate cancer. PSMA PET/CT has shown superiority over conventional imaging even in staging of localized prostate cancer based on recent randomized control data. Imaging parameters from PET/MRI have been shown to be associated with malignancy, Gleason score and tumour volume.

Given the country’s aging population and recent liberalization of the two-child policy, understanding the effects of intergenerational caregiving on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals is crucial. This study aimed to explore the impact of intergenerational caregiving on mental health among middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals. Methods We analyzed data from the China Health and Aging Tracking Survey (CHARLS) 2013, consisting of 6602 participants finally. Personal information, family structure, financial support, health status, and physical measurements were selected for analysis. Correlation and regression analyses were used for relationships among variables controlling for potential confounding variables. Mental health status was evaluated using the depression self-rating scale. Results There is a significant positive effect of intergenerational care on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) people. Additionally, we re-profiled intergenerational care variables by considering the number and length of intergenerational caregivers, and found that the effects remained significant.

Active aging needs must be identified to help strategic planning for older adults' health and wellbeing. This study aimed to explore the active aging needs from the perspectives of older adults and geriatric experts. Methods This exploratory-descriptive qualitative study was conducted in four provinces with the oldest populations in Iran. Semi-structured and focus group interviews were conducted with 41 participants (20 older adults and 21 geriatric experts), who were chosen through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were analyzed using the conventional content analysis. Results This study identified three themes and thirteen categories from the data: (1) basic individual needs with three categories of physiological, psycho-emotional, and spiritual needs; and (2) managerial needs with seven categories of political-legal, socio-economic, and cultural-spiritual infrastructures, academic strategies, an age-friendly environment; technological services, and provision of specialized services and daycare for older adults, and (3) educational needs with three categories of training self-care and self-efficacy, empowering the health care workers; and empowering the family.

However, these associations have not been explored using procedures that analyze the sequential effects between risk factors of falling. The present study aimed to examine the effects of muscle strength, agility, and fear of falling on risk of falling using path analysis in community-dwelling older adults. In total, 49 elderly (female = 33, male = 16) participants aged between 65 and 76 years (M = 68.38 years; SD = 6.22) were included for analysis. Muscle strength, agility, fear of falling, and risk of falling were assessed using validated instruments for the older adult population. The proposed model shows that muscle strength was negatively associated with agility. Consequently, agility was negatively associated with fear of falling. The same trend appeared between fear of falling and risk of falling. The effect sizes were between small and medium for agility (R2 = 0.16), fear of falling, (R2 = 0.29), and risk of falling (R2 = 0.03). The main finding of the present study was that muscle strength was significantly correlated with agility, which, in turn, predicted fear of falling. Consequently, lower scores for fear of falling explained lower risk of falling in community-dwelling older adults. While muscle strength is a crucial component of physical fitness, only with adequate levels of agility can older adults possess the efficacy and ability to perform daily tasks.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,20,,2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,"Filipe Rodrigues, A.

This study systematically retrieved and analyzed articles on the psychological characteristics of older adult victims of online fraud. First, we found that there was no evidence that older adults were more prevalent than other individuals of other ages among online fraud victims, and current researchers have focused more on why older adults are easy targets for fraud (susceptibility to being cheated). Second, research on psychological factors of older adults' susceptibility to online fraud has mainly focused on cognitive function, trust traits, and other personality traits, such as social loneliness, the Big Five personality traits, and self-control. Among them, most researchers claim that the cyber-cheating of older adults may be due to a decline in their cognitive function. However, there has not been a consensus on how cognitive function and physical and mental conditions affect older people who are cheated. Third, techniques (i.e., methods and techniques used by fraudsters) and experience (i.e., familiarity with internet technology or fraud) may be related to the susceptibility of older adults to fraud, and these studies have also not yet generated a consensus supported by reliable data.

When the alterations in sleep become substantial, they can generate or accelerate cognitive decline, even in the absence of overt pathology. In fact, impaired sleep represents one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This systematic review aimed to analyze the studies on sleep quality in aging, also considering mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The review process was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. A total of 71 studies were included, and the whole sample had a mean age that ranged from 58.3 to 93.7 years (62.8–93.7 healthy participants and 61.8–86.7 pathological populations). Of these selected studies, 33 adopt subjective measurements, 31 adopt objective measures, and 10 studies used both. Pathological aging showed a worse impoverishment of sleep than older adults, in both subjective and objective measurements. The most common aspect compromised in AD and MCI were REM sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and sleep duration. These results underline that sleep alterations are associated with cognitive impairment. In conclusion, the frequency and severity of sleep disturbance appear to follow the evolution of cognitive impairment.

Objective To ascertain the state of the science on social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions to improve all-hazard household disaster preparedness. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Databases, trial registers, reports, and websites were searched, and citation trails followed utilizing replicable methods. Individual, cluster, and cross-over randomized controlled trials of non-institutionalized, community-dwelling populations and non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after, and program evaluation studies were included. At least two review authors independently screened each potentially relevant study for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane’s RoB2 tool for randomized studies and ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies. Meta-analyses were applied using a random-effects model. Where meta-analysis was not indicated, results were synthesized using summary statistics of intervention effect estimates and vote counting based on effect direction. The evidence was rated using GRADE. Results 17 studies were included with substantial methodological and clinical diversity. No intervention effect was observed for preparedness supplies (OR = 6.12, 95% 0.13 to 284.37) or knowledge (SMD = 0.96, 95% CI −0.15 to 2.08) outcomes. A small positive effect (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91) was observed for preparedness behaviors, with very low certainty of evidence. No studies reported adverse effects from the interventions. Conclusion Research designs elucidating the efficacy of practical yet complex and multi- faceted social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions present substantial methodological challenges where rigorous study design elements may not match the contextual public health priority needs and resources where interventions were delivered. While the overall strength of the evidence was evaluated as low to very low, we acknowledge the valuable and informative work of the included studies. The research represents the seminal work in this field and provides an important foundation for the state of the science of household emergency preparedness intervention effectiveness and efficacy. The findings are relevant to disaster preparedness practice and research, and we encourage researchers to continue this line of research, using these studies and this review to inform ongoing improvements in study designs.",Frontiers in Public Health,journal,d3dd5449-daa1-4d57-9412-9add6037584f,Frontiers in Public Health,,11,,2024,2024-02-23 00:00:00,"Taryn Amberson, Tara N Heagele, Tamar Wyte-Lake, M.

However, understanding their precise roles in diseases remains challenging due to their complex functional mechanisms. Various methodologies have emerged to predict the pathogenic significance of these genetic variants. Typically, these methods employ an integrative approach, leveraging diverse data sources that provide critical insights into genomic function. Despite the abundance of publicly available data sources and databases, the process of navigating, extracting, and pre-processing features for machine learning models can be daunting. Furthermore, researchers often invest substantial effort in feature extraction, only to later discover that these features lack informativeness. Results In this paper, we present DrivR-Base, an innovative resource that efficiently extracts and integrates molecular information (features) for single nucleotide variants from a wide range of databases and tools, including AlphaFold, ENCODE, and Variant Effect Predictor. The resulting features can be used as input for machine learning models designed to predict the pathogenic impact of human genome variants in disease. Moreover, these feature sets have applications beyond this, including haploinsufficiency prediction and the development of drug repurposing tools.

By combining high-throughput ribosome load data with multiplexed mRNA and protein abundance readouts, we mapped the cis-regulatory landscape of thousands of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) variants from RNA to protein and found numerous coding variants that alter COMT expression. Finally, we trained machine learning models to map signatures of variant effects on COMT gene expression and uncovered both directional and divergent impacts across expression layers.

While somatic SNVs near canonical splice sites have been reported to cause abnormal splicing of cancer-related genes, whether these SNVs can affect gene expression through other mechanisms remains an open question. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing and exome data from 4,998 cancer patients covering ten cancer types and identified 152 somatic SNVs near splice sites that were associated with abnormal intronic polyadenylation (IPA). IPA-associated somatic variants favored the localization near the donor splice sites compared to the acceptor splice sites. A proportion of SNV-associated IPA events overlapped with premature cleavage and polyadenylation events triggered by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) inhibition. GC content, intron length and polyadenylation signal were three genomic features that differentiated between SNV-associated IPA and intron retention. Notably, IPA-associated SNVs were enriched in tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including the well-known TSGs such as PTEN and CDH1 with recurrent SNV-associated IPA events. Minigene assay confirmed that SNVs from PTEN, CDH1, VEGFA, GRHL2, CUL3 and WWC2 could lead to IPA. This work reveals that IPA acts as a novel mechanism explaining the functional consequence of somatic SNVs in human cancer.",Nucleic Acids Research,journal,da96c220-cd39-4894-bae6-d2d77c8e7aa9,Nucleic Acids Research,10369 - 10381,49,,2021,2021-09-11 00:00:00,"Zhaozhao Zhao, Qiushi Xu, Ran Wei, Leihuan Huang, Weixu Wang, Gang Wei, T.

e4f275dd8e4afc0af33d8a7239d50a9ab0fe72d5,10.1186/s12915-020-00930-0,Current cancer driver variant predictors learn to recognize driver genes instead of functional variants,"Identifying variants that drive tumor progression (driver variants) and distinguishing these from variants that are a byproduct of the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer (passenger variants) is a crucial step for understanding tumorigenesis and precision oncology. Various bioinformatics methods have attempted to solve this complex task. In this study, we investigate the assumptions on which these methods are based, showing that the different definitions of driver and passenger variants influence the difficulty of the prediction task. More importantly, we prove that the data sets have a construction bias which prevents the machine learning (ML) methods to actually learn variant-level functional effects, despite their excellent performance. This effect results from the fact that in these data sets, the driver variants map to a few driver genes, while the passenger variants spread across thousands of genes, and thus just learning to recognize driver genes provides almost perfect predictions. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel data set that minimizes this bias by ensuring that all genes covered by the data contain both driver and passenger variants. As a result, we show that the tested predictors experience a significant drop in performance, which should not be considered as poorer modeling, but rather as correcting unwarranted optimism. Finally, we propose a weighting procedure to completely eliminate the gene effects on such predictions, thus precisely evaluating the ability of predictors to model the functional effects of single variants, and we show that indeed this task is still open.",BMC Biology,journal,1617f5c3-5410-462d-91c9-7aa8ced2d91d,BMC Biology,,19,,2021,2021-01-13 00:00:00,"D.

Here, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing (average read depth 584×) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation and matched blood samples from 52 patients with AD and 11 individuals not affected by AD. The number of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in AD brain specimens increases significantly with aging, and the rate of mutation accumulation in the brain is 4.8-fold slower than that in AD blood. The putatively pathogenic brain somatic mutations identified in 26.9% (14 of 52) of AD individuals are enriched in PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway genes known to contribute to hyperphosphorylation of tau. We show that a pathogenic brain somatic mutation in PIN1 leads to a loss-of-function mutation. In vitro mimicking of haploinsufficiency of PIN1 aberrantly increases tau phosphorylation and aggregation. This study provides new insights into the genetic architecture underlying the pathogenesis of AD. The role of brain somatic mutations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not well understood.

The vibration of the in-core sensors near their nominal locations is a new problem for neutronic field reconstruction. Current field-reconstruction methods fail to handle spatially moving sensors. In this study, we propose a Voronoi tessellation technique in combination with convolutional neural networks to handle this challenge. Observations from movable in-core sensors were projected onto the same global field structure using Voronoi tessellation, holding the magnitude and location information of the sensors. General convolutional neural networks were used to learn maps from observations to the global field. The proposed method reconstructed multi-physics fields (including fast flux, thermal flux, and power rate) using observations from a single field (such as thermal flux). Numerical tests based on the IAEA benchmark demonstrated the potential of the proposed method in practical engineering applications, particularly within an amplitude of 5 cm around the nominal locations, which led to average relative errors below 5% and 10% in the $$L_2$$

Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the research on early warning and prediction of agricultural futures price. For the prediction of futures price, there are two kinds of common models: one is the traditional classic time series model, and the other is the neural network model under the wave of artificial intelligence. This paper selects the 1976 closing data of agricultural futures index from January 10, 2012, to February 27, 2020, and uses the time series differential autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA model) and long short-term memory model (LSTM model) to study this work, respectively, and compares the predicted effects of the two models in some metrics. Based on the predicted results of the two models, a simple trading strategy is established, and the trading effects of the two models are compared. The results show that the LSTM model has obvious advantage over ARIMA time series model in the price index prediction of agricultural futures market.",Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,journal,f32b7322-b69c-4e63-801d-8f50784ef778,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,2021,,2021,2021-10-31 00:00:00,"Shijun Chen, Xiaoli Han, Yunbin Shen, Chong Ye","2110758560, 2149248380, 1845786937, 114665021",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a248b5f208ed597f2ee2aad6c2a15e23f631e64d,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science, Economics, Medicine",2110758560,['JournalArticle'],11.0,39.0

It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world's population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.",Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,journal,2ca1e2ac-8c3b-4251-94ed-24846d391d3b,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,,2022,,2022,2022-01-20 00:00:00,"Milind Natu, M.

It is crucial to detect and patch vulnerabilities before attacks happen. However, existing vulnerability detection methods suffer from long-term dependency, out of vocabulary, bias towards global features or local features, and coarse detection granularity. This paper proposes an automatic vulnerability detection framework in source code based on a hybrid neural network. First, the inputs are transformed into an intermediate representation with explicit structure information using lower level virtual machine intermediate representation (LLVM IR) and backward program slicing. After the transformation, the size of samples and the size of vocabulary are significantly reduced. A hybrid neural network model is then applied to extract high-level features of vulnerability, which learns features both from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The former is applied to learn local vulnerability features, such as buffer size. Furthermore, the latter is utilized to learn global features, such as data dependency. The extracted features are made up of concatenated outputs of CNN and RNN. Experiments are performed to validate our vulnerability detection method. The results show that our proposed method achieves excellent results with F1-scores of 98.6% and accuracy of 99.0% on the SARD dataset. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,3201,11,,2021,2021-04-02 00:00:00,"Xin Li, Lu Wang, Yang Xin, Yixian Yang, Qi Tang, Yuling Chen","2153900482, 2153518398, 34811223, 47796563, 2069578129, 49069825",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac701065bdcff3322e4ea8b8a4e2a6df0fe831b1,Computer Science,2153900482,,27.0,47.0

The fatigue crack growth life of metal matrix composites (MMCs) is estimated based on an improved Paris formula. Considering the different expansion coefficient of different materials, the unequal shrinkage will lead to residual stress when the composite is molded and cooled. The crack growth model is improved by the modified stress ratio based on residual stress. The Dijkstra algorithm is introduced to avoid the cracks passing through the strengthening base and the characteristics of crack steps. This model can be extended to predict crack growth length for other similarly-structured composite materials. The shortest path of crack growth is simulated by using path planning algorithm, and the fatigue life of composites is calculated based on the shortest path and improved model. And the residual stress caused by temperature change is considered to improve the fatigue crack growth model in the material. The improved model can well predict the fatigue life curve of composites. By analyzing the fatigue life of composites, it is found that there is a certain regularity based on metal materials, and the new fatigue prediction model can also reflect this regularity.",Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering,journal,672d5dd9-8192-4f70-9aee-52fc9cf99820,Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering,1-12,36,,2023,2023-02-20 00:00:00,"Wenqian Shang, Xintian Liu, Xu Wang, Xiaolan Wang","2066300123, 1857224, 2108599873, 50141927",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc9b7bf86a8f750fff4c019fd3ae599389cb7a99,"Engineering, Materials Science",2066300123,,5.0,44.0

Despite its relatively late formation and persistent developmental changes, the GABAergic system promotes the ordered shaping of neuronal circuits at the structural and functional levels. Within this frame, interneurons participate first in spontaneous and later in sensory-evoked activity patterns that precede cortical functions of the mature brain. Upon their subcortical generation, interneurons in the embryonic brain must first orderly migrate to and settle in respective target layers before they can actively engage in cortical network activity. During this process, changes at the molecular and synaptic level of interneurons allow not only their coordinated formation but also the pruning of connections as well as excitatory and inhibitory synapses. At the postsynaptic site, the shift of GABAergic signaling from an excitatory towards an inhibitory response is required to enable synchronization within cortical networks. Concomitantly, the progressive specification of different interneuron subtypes endows the neocortex with distinct local cortical circuits and region-specific modulation of neuronal firing. Finally, the apoptotic process further refines neuronal populations by constantly maintaining a controlled ratio of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Interestingly, many of these fundamental and complex processes are influenced—if not directly controlled—by electrical activity. Interneurons on the subcellular, cellular, and network level are affected by high frequency patterns, such as spindle burst and gamma oscillations in rodents and delta brushes in humans. Conversely, the maturation of interneuron structure and function on each of these scales feeds back and contributes to the generation of cortical activity patterns that are essential for the proper peri- and postnatal development. Overall, a more precise description of the conducting role of interneurons in terms of how they contribute to specific activity patterns—as well as how specific activity patterns impinge on their maturation as orchestra members—will lead to a better understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological development and function of the nervous system.",Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience,journal,7101fb84-a263-47ee-80ff-743ece1018d3,Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience,,14,,2022,2022-01-03 00:00:00,"David Warm, Jonas Schroer, A.

An intriguing question is how physiological neuronal activity modifies the expression of these molecules in developing cortical networks. Here, we addressed this issue, focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the factors underlying cortical wiring. Real-time imaging of BDNF promoter activity in organotypic slice cultures revealed that patterned stimuli differentially regulated the increase and the time course of the promoter activity in upper layer neurons. Calcium imaging further demonstrated that stimulus-dependent increases in the promoter activity were roughly proportional to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration per unit time. Finally, optogenetic stimulation showed that the promoter activity was increased efficiently by patterned stimulation in defined cortical circuits. These results suggest that physiological stimulation patterns differentially tune activity-dependent gene expression in developing cortical neurons via cortical circuits, synaptic responses, and alteration of intracellular calcium signaling.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,journal,2ca4279c-8ed7-4280-8022-09e577923a09,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,15,,2021,2021-12-10 00:00:00,"Yumi Miyasaka, N.

During early development, cortical cultures exhibit a wide repertoire of synchronous bursting dynamics whose characterization may help to understand the parameters governing the transition from immature to mature networks. Here we used machine learning techniques to characterize and predict the developing spontaneous activity in mouse cortical neurons on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) during the first three weeks in vitro. Network activity at three stages of early development was defined by 18 electrophysiological features of spikes, bursts, synchrony, and connectivity. The variability of neuronal network activity during early development was investigated by applying k-means and self-organizing map (SOM) clustering analysis to features of bursts and synchrony. These electrophysiological features were predicted at the third week in vitro with high accuracy from those at earlier times using three machine learning models: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. Our results indicate that initial patterns of electrical activity during the first week in vitro may already predetermine the final development of the neuronal network activity. The methodological approach used here may be applied to explore the biological mechanisms underlying the complex dynamics of spontaneous activity in developing neuronal cultures.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,,2021,2021-10-14 00:00:00,"D.

This process is attenuated by increased levels of neuronal activity and enhanced by suppression of activity. To uncover whether the mere level of activity or also the temporal structure of electrical activity affects neuronal death rates, we optogenetically controlled spontaneous activity of synaptically-isolated neurons in developing cortical cultures. Our results demonstrate that action potential firing of primary cortical neurons promotes neuronal survival throughout development. Chronic patterned optogenetic stimulation allowed to effectively modulate the firing pattern of single neurons in the absence of synaptic inputs while maintaining stable overall activity levels. Replacing the burst firing pattern with a non-physiological, single pulse pattern significantly increased cell death rates as compared to physiological burst stimulation. Furthermore, physiological burst stimulation led to an elevated peak in intracellular calcium and an increase in the expression level of classical activity-dependent targets but also decreased Bax/BCL-2 expression ratio and reduced caspase 3/7 activity. In summary, these results demonstrate at the single-cell level that the temporal pattern of action potentials is critical for neuronal survival versus cell death fate during cortical development, besides the pro-survival effect of action potential firing per se.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,22,,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,"I.

Early prognosis is currently based on cranial ultrasound (CUS), MRI, EEG, NIRS, and/or general movements assessed at specific ages, and predicting outcome in an individual (precision medicine) is not yet possible. New algorithms based on large databases and machine learning applied to clinical, neuromonitoring, and neuroimaging data and genetic analysis and assays measuring multiple biomarkers (omics) can fulfill the needs of modern neonatology. A synergy of all these techniques and the use of automatic quantitative analysis might give clinicians the possibility to provide patient-targeted decision-making for individualized diagnosis, therapy, and outcome prediction. This review will first focus on common neonatal neurological diseases, associated risk factors, and most common treatments. After that, we will discuss how precision medicine and machine learning (ML) approaches could change the future of prediction and prognosis in this field.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,journal,c2ae00e7-6d19-4234-aace-a3bf6fd21bd5,Frontiers in Pediatrics,,9,,2021,2021-05-19 00:00:00,"M.

Along this journey, Digital Twin has been introduced to the industry as a concept that holds the promise to challenge the status-quo and address long standing problems of productivity, efficiency, and value. While this concept is becoming more familiar among practitioners, there is a lack of universal definitions of what the Digital Twin of a construction project is. Additionally, while identifying the purpose of Digital Twin is recognized as the first step in implementing Digital Twins, there is little discussion on the perception of construction practitioners of the extent to which Digital Twin can deliver value. To address these research gaps and building on the existing work on Digital Twins in the context of the construction industry, this paper first proposes a definition of the Digital Twin of a construction project. Next, a series of semi-structured interviews are conducted with nine construction practitioners to understand their perceptions on the use and challenges of Digital Twins. Thematic analysis is then used to analyze interview data and summarize Digital Twins applications, capabilities, and challenges. Forty direct applications were identified and grouped into seven capabilities. Digital Twins capabilities of Increase Transparency of Information and Real-Time Monitoring, Analysis, and Feedback were the most discussed with a total of eight applications each, followed by Better Stakeholder Collaboration which had seven applications. The discussion on challenges led to the identification of 34 challenges to implementing Digital Twin, grouped into six categories coded through thematic analysis. The category on Data Understanding, Preparation, and Usage Challenges was found to be the most critical for the interviewees. Additionally, the paper presents a case study on how building authority can be integrated into Digital Twins and leverage its use throughout the lifecycle of a building. Future work can further investigate the challenges and develop prototypes that can help in quantifying the benefits of implementing Digital Twins on a Construction Project.",Frontiers in Built Environment,journal,d44a90af-d645-4877-9b98-d89aedc53d99,,,8,,2022,2022-06-13 00:00:00,"Ashtarout Ammar, Hala Nassereddine, Nadine AbdulBaky, Anwar AbouKansour, Juliano Tannoury, H.

In light of the spread of digital technology and modern managerial approaches, the concept of a digital twin is being used on a large scale with the current trend and direction to digitalize activities providing many economic, social and technical advantages. A digital twin is a system in which a virtual representation of a real entity or physical system is used continuously by being fed with data and deriving outputs in the form of decisions and actions that are generated through the processes of machine learning, simulation, development and lifecycle management. This study aims to review the literature on construction project management through the lens of digital twins and ways to use them in the field to improve operational results. The authors propose a framework for analyzing and supervising the development of digital twins that uses three main stages: the commonly encountered Building Information Modeling (BIM); the existing monitoring and actuation digital twins; and an envisioned third stage that makes use of artificial intelligence, complex visualization instruments and advanced controls with the capability to exact change within a construction project on the building site.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2022,2022-03-13 00:00:00,"Tareq Salem, M.

Because of the complexity and non-linearity, a visual interpretation of FHR signals using common guidelines usually results in significant subjective inter-observer and intra-observer variability. Objective: Therefore, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology have recently been developed to assist obstetricians in making objective medical decisions.MethodsIn this work, we present an 8-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to automatically predict fetal acidemia. After signal preprocessing, the input 2-dimensional (2D) images are obtained using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which provides a better way to observe and capture the hidden characteristic information of the FHR signals in both the time and frequency domains. Unlike the conventional machine learning (ML) approaches, this work does not require the execution of complex feature engineering, i.e., feature extraction and selection. In fact, 2D CNN model can self-learn useful features from the input data with the prerequisite of not losing informative features, representing the tremendous advantage of deep learning (DL) over ML.ResultsBased on the test open-access database (CTU-UHB), after comprehensive experimentation, we achieved better classification performance using the optimal CNN configuration compared to other state-of-the-art methods: the averaged ten-fold cross-validation of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, quality index defined as the geometric mean of the sensitivity and specificity, and the area under the curve yielded results of 98.34, 98.22, 94.87, 96.53 and 97.82%, respectivelyConclusionsOnce the proposed CNN model is successfully trained, the corresponding CAD system can be served as an effective tool to predict fetal asphyxia objectively and accurately.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,journal,76da9cc5-c5a7-42b4-a250-3e708c5f4980,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,19,,2019,2019-12-01 00:00:00,"Zhidong Zhao, Yanjun Deng, Yang Zhang, Yefei Zhang, Xiaohong Zhang, Lihuan Shao","2673242, 5513943, 2145955724, 2115892668, 2108583979, 30658926",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3f31f9f34df9962c0ef24a8d9c2067a04127708,"Computer Science, Medicine",2673242,['JournalArticle'],103.0,58.0

Intrapartum complications are one of the major causes of perinatal mortality. Fetal cardiotocograph (CTGs) can be used as a monitoring tool to identify high-risk women during labor. Aim: The objective of this study was to study the precision of machine learning algorithm techniques on CTG data in identifying high-risk fetuses. Methods: CTG data of 2126 pregnant women were obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Ten different machine learning classification models were trained using CTG data. Sensitivity, precision, and F1 score for each class and overall accuracy of each model were obtained to predict normal, suspect, and pathological fetal states. Model with best performance on specified metrics was then identified. Results: Determined by obstetricians' interpretation of CTGs as gold standard, 70% of them were normal, 20% were suspect, and 10% had a pathological fetal state. On training data, the classification models generated by XGBoost, decision tree, and random forest had high precision (>96%) to predict the suspect and pathological state of the fetus based on the CTG tracings. However, on testing data, XGBoost model had the highest precision to predict a pathological fetal state (>92%). Conclusion: The classification model developed using XGBoost technique had the highest prediction accuracy for an adverse fetal outcome.

However, the lack of regularly updated, continental-scale, and high spatial resolution (30 m) land cover data limit our ability to better understand the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of land surface changes. Despite the free availability of high spatial resolution Landsat satellite data, continental-scale land cover mapping using high resolution Landsat satellite data was not feasible until now due to the need for high-performance computing to store, process, and analyze this large volume of high resolution satellite data. In this study, we present an approach to quantify continental land cover and impervious surface changes over a long period of time (15 years) using high resolution Landsat satellite observations and Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform.

As the clinical adoption of deep learning algorithms, a subfield of AI, progresses, concerns have arisen regarding the impact of AI biases and discrimination on patient health. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of concerns associated with AI fairness; discuss strategies to mitigate AI biases; and emphasize the need for cooperation among physicians, AI researchers, AI developers, policymakers, and patients to ensure equitable AI integration. First, we define and introduce the concept of fairness in AI applications in healthcare and radiology, emphasizing the benefits and challenges of incorporating AI into clinical practice. Next, we delve into concerns regarding fairness in healthcare, addressing the various causes of biases in AI and potential concerns such as misdiagnosis, unequal access to treatment, and ethical considerations. We then outline strategies for addressing fairness, such as the importance of diverse and representative data and algorithm audits. Additionally, we discuss ethical and legal considerations such as data privacy, responsibility, accountability, transparency, and explainability in AI. Finally, we present the Fairness of Artificial Intelligence Recommendations in healthcare (FAIR) statement to offer best practices. Through these efforts, we aim to provide a foundation for discussing the responsible and equitable implementation and deployment of AI in healthcare.",Japanese Journal of Radiology,journal,c4ba8fc8-e8c0-4eb3-bee0-b61f85830814,Japanese Journal of Radiology,3 - 15,42,,2023,2023-08-04 00:00:00,"D.

Numerical simulations using a two-dimensional axisymmetric multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation are employed to obtain the data of fluid density. Using the data of fluid density and nodal coordinates, the gradients of fluid density are determined and then used to generate numerical schlieren images. Based on these images, the triple point paths are derived and compared with the models of the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) as well as two models from the open literature. It is found that the numerically derived triple point paths are in good agreement with those predicted by a recently published model in the open literature for the typical ground range of shock wave propagation of up to 6 m. Considering the whole distance range, it is found that the agreement of different models of the triple point path with the numerical ones depends on the considered blast scenario, i.e., the scaled charge height. For small-scaled charge heights, the model of the UFC and the recently published model in the open literature are in better agreement with the numerical results than the other two models, whereas the NRDC model has the best agreement with the numerical results for large-scaled charge heights. Based on the numerical results, a new empirical formula is proposed for the prediction of the triple point path, which is valid for a wide range of the scaled charge heights from 0.5 to 3.5 m/kg1/3 and scaled ground distances up to 15 m/kg1/3.",Shock Waves,journal,2533aa94-9bb4-4257-981d-475110e7f961,Shock Waves,677 - 686,30,,2020,2020-09-01 00:00:00,"W.

Machine learning evolved from the study of pattern recognition and explores the notion that algorithms can learn from and make predictions on data. And, as they begin to become more ‘intelligent’, these algorithms can overcome program instructions to make highly accurate, data-driven decisions. Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques (including machine learning, predictive modelling and data mining) and uses statistics (both historical and current) to estimate, or ‘predict’, future outcomes. These outcomes might be behaviors of a customer likely to exhibit or possible changes in the market, for example. Predictive analytics help us to understand possible future occurrences by analyzing the past. In this research it’s intended to combine machine learning algorithms with predictive analytics to do predictions on sports results specially football matches result prediction.",International Journal of Engineering Applied Sciences and Technology,journal,3160206c-9131-4319-995b-582bc038f4e6,International Journal of Engineering Applied Sciences and Technology,,,,2020,2020-07-31 00:00:00,"Sayed Muhammad Yonus Saiedy, Muhammad Aslam Hemmat Qachmas, Dr. Amanullah Faqiri","2126597794, 2137872594, 2137853284",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014f67923fecc0fe3f0349adaa08a627fd65ef01,Computer Science,2126597794,,5.0,29.0

Genetic testing is crucial for establishing a treatment plan. In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to discover that LRP1B mutation was associated with a poor prognosis in GC. Through layer-by-layer research, it was found that LRP1B expression in GC was accompanied by a higher-level infiltration of CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163. It is concluded that LRP1B expression can stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration, thus bringing clinical benefits to GC patients. Abstract Background: Recent studies have shown that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1b (LRP1B), as a potential tumor suppressor, is implicated in the response to immunotherapy. The frequency of LRP1B mutation gene is high in many cancers, but its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not been determined. Methods: The prognostic value of LRP1B mutation in a cohort containing 100 patients having received radical gastrectomy for stage II–III GC was explored. By analyzing the data of LRP1B mRNA, the risk score of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LRP1B mutation-type and wild-type was constructed based on the TCGA-STAD cohort. The infiltration of tumor immune cells was evaluated by the CYBERSORT algorithm and verified by immunohistochemistry. Results: LRP1B gene mutation was an independent risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in GC patients (HR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.28–5.14, p = 0.008). The Kaplan–Meier curve demonstrated a shorter survival time in high-risk patients stratified according to risk score (p < 0.0001). CYBERSORT analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly concentrated in CD4+ T cells and macrophages. TIMER analysis suggested that LRP1B expression was associated with the infiltration of CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LRP1B was expressed in the tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells in 16/89 and 26/89 of the cohort, respectively. LRP1B-positive TCs were associated with higher levels of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163 (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that LRP1B-positive TCs represented an independent protective factor of DFS in GC patients (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.10–0.93, p = 0.042). Conclusions: LRP1B has a high prognostic value in GC. LRP1B may stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration to provide GC patients with survival benefits.",Cancers,journal,d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,15,,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,"Rui Wang, Guangtao Zhang, Xiaohong Zhu, Yan Xu, N.

This study aims to construct a risk model to guide immunotherapy in LUAD patients effectively. Materials and methods LUAD Bulk RNA-seq data for the construction of a model, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (GSE203360) for cell cluster analysis, and microarray data (GSE31210) for validation were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We used the Seurat R package to filter and process scRNA-seq data. Sample clustering was performed in the ConsensusClusterPlus R package. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups were mined by the Limma R package. MCP-counter, CIBERSORT, ssGSEA, and ESTIMATE were employed to evaluate immune characteristics. Stepwise multivariate analysis, Univariate Cox analysis, and Lasso regression analysis were conducted to identify key prognostic genes and were used to construct the risk model. Key prognostic gene expressions were explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. Results A total of 27 immune cell marker genes associated with prognosis were identified for subtyping LUAD samples into clusters C3, C2, and C1. C1 had the longest overall survival and highest immune infiltration among them, followed by C2 and C3. Oncogenic pathways such as VEGF, EFGR, and MAPK were more activated in C3 compared to the other two clusters. Based on the DEGs among clusters, we confirmed seven key prognostic genes including CPA3, S100P, PTTG1, LOXL2, MELTF, PKP2, and TMPRSS11E. Two risk groups defined by the seven-gene risk model presented distinct responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, immune infiltration, and prognosis. The mRNA and protein level of CPA3 was decreased, while the remaining six gene levels were increased in clinical tumor tissues. Conclusion Immune cell markers are effective in clustering LUAD samples into different subtypes, and they play important roles in regulating the immune microenvironment and cancer development. In addition, the seven-gene risk model may serve as a guide for assisting in personalized treatment in LUAD patients.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,14,,2023,2023-07-31 00:00:00,"Jianfeng Shu, Jinni Jiang, Guofang Zhao","11861590, 2226698163, 12181440",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ab49eabfc27c82e118e73d4fb47456aced25de8,Medicine,11861590,['JournalArticle'],11.0,50.0

It is imperative to accurately and intelligently select appropriate patients for immunotherapy or predict the immunotherapy efficacy. In recent years, machine learning (ML)-based artificial intelligence (AI) was developed in the area of medical-industrial convergence. AI can help model and predict medical information. A growing number of studies have combined radiology, pathology, genomics, proteomics data in order to predict the expression levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer patients or predict the likelihood of immunotherapy benefits and side effects. Finally, with the advancement of AI and ML, it is believed that ""digital biopsy"" can replace the traditional single assessment method to benefit more cancer patients and help clinical decision-making in the future. In this review, the applications of AI in PD-L1/TMB prediction, TME prediction and lung cancer immunotherapy are discussed.",Journal of Hematology & Oncology,journal,719730f8-81cf-406a-9c5b-5f991306512a,Journal of Hematology & Oncology,,16,,2023,2023-05-24 00:00:00,"Qing Gao, Luyu Yang, Mingjun Lu, Renjing Jin, H.

Recently, the rapid development of immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for LUAD patients. Closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment and immune cell functions, more and more new immune checkpoints have been discovered, and various cancer treatment studies targeting these novel immune checkpoints are currently in full swing. However, studies on the phenotype and clinical significance of novel immune checkpoints in LUAD are still limited, and only a minority of patients with LUAD can benefit from immunotherapy. Methods: The LUAD datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, and the immune checkpoints score of each sample were calculated based on the expression of the 82 immune checkpoints-related genes (ICGs). The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to obtain the gene modules closely related to the score and two different LUAD clusters were identified based on these module genes by the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) Algorithm. The differentially expressed genes between the two clusters were further used to construct a predictive signature for prognosis, immune features, and the response to immunotherapy for LUAD patients through a series of regression analyses. Results: A new immune checkpoints-related signature was finally established according to the expression of 7 genes (FCER2, CD200R1, RHOV, TNNT2, WT1, AHSG, and KRTAP5-8). This signature can stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with different survival outcomes and sensitivity to immunotherapy, and the signature has been well validated in different clinical subgroups and validation cohorts. Conclusion: We constructed a novel immune checkpoints-related LUAD risk assessment system, which has a good predictive ability and significance for guiding immunotherapy. We believe that these findings will not only aid in the clinical management of LUAD patients but also provide some insights into screening appropriate patients for immunotherapy.",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,journal,5b97da83-0106-4e9f-aef2-4c3006afbb2c,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,,11,,2023,2023-05-10 00:00:00,"Linbin Hua, Jiyue Wu, Jiashu Ge, Xin Li, B.

Ovarian cancer is an extremely dangerous gynecologic malignancy for which there are no adequate tools to predict prognostic risk. Here, we identified a prognostic signature consisting of nine genes related to purine metabolism, including ACSM1, CACNA1C, EPHA4, TPM3, PDIA4, JUNB, EXOSC4, TRPM2, and CXCL9. The risk groups defined by the signature are able to distinguish the prognostic risk and the immune landscape of patients. In particular, the risk scores offer promising personalized drug options. By combining risk scores with clinical characteristics, we have created a more detailed composite nomogram that allows for a more complete and individualized prediction of prognosis.

The effects of lipid metabolism on tumor growth have been explored, but the mechanistic details of the association of lipid metabolism disorders with PCa remain largely elusive. Methods The RNA sequencing data of the GSE45604 and The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) datasets were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and UCSC Xena databases, respectively. The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) was utilized to identify lipid metabolism-related genes. The limma R package was used to identify differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related genes (DE-LMRGs) and differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs). Moreover, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) were applied to select signature miRNAs and construct a lipid metabolism-related diagnostic model. The expression levels of selected differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related miRNAs (DE-LMRMs) in PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) specimens were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‒PCR). Furthermore, a transcription factor (TF)-miRNA‒mRNA network was constructed. Eventually, Kaplan‒Meier (KM) curves were plotted to illustrate the associations between signature miRNA-related mRNAs and TFs and overall survival (OS) along with biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCR). Results Forty-seven LMRMs were screened based on the correlation analysis of 29 DE-LMRGs and 56 DEMs, in which 27 LMRMs were stably expressed in the GSE45604 dataset. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and machine learning methods were employed to develop a lipid metabolism-related diagnostic signature, which may be of diagnostic value for PCa patients. qRT‒PCR results showed that all seven key DE-LMRMs were differentially expressed between PCa and BPH tissues. Eventually, a TF-miRNA‒mRNA network was constructed. Conclusions These results suggested that 7 key diagnostic miRNAs were closely related to PCa pathological processes and provided new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of PCa. Moreover, CLIC6 and SCNN1A linked to miR-200c-3p had good prognostic potential and provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of PCa.",Lipids in Health and Disease,journal,eaeef36d-16ae-4b09-a697-254257ed944e,Lipids in Health and Disease,,22,,2023,2023-03-14 00:00:00,"Tianyuan Zhai, Meng Dou, Yubo Ma, Hong Wang, F.

Accurate suggestions of reaction conditions are required for experimental validation and can have a significant effect on the success or failure of an attempted transformation. However, de novo condition recommendation remains a challenging and under-explored problem and relies heavily on chemists’ knowledge and experience. In this work, we develop a neural-network model to predict the chemical context (catalyst(s), solvent(s), reagent(s)), as well as the temperature most suitable for any particular organic reaction. Trained on ∼10 million examples from Reaxys, the model is able to propose conditions where a close match to the recorded catalyst, solvent, and reagent is found within the top-10 predictions 69.6% of the time, with top-10 accuracies for individual species reaching 80–90%. Temperature is accurately predicted within ±20 °C from the recorded temperature in 60–70% of test cases, with higher accuracy for cases with correct chemical context predictions. The utility of the model is illustrated through several examples spanning a range of common reaction classes. We also demonstrate that the model implicitly learns a continuous numerical embedding of solvent and reagent species that captures their functional similarity.",ACS Central Science,journal,df882f0f-d88c-4139-8462-219dcb05d97c,ACS Central Science,1465 - 1476,4,,2018,2018-11-16 00:00:00,"Hanyu Gao, Thomas J.

In this work, we show that recurrent neural networks can be trained as generative models for molecular structures, similar to statistical language models in natural language processing. We demonstrate that the properties of the generated molecules correlate very well with the properties of the molecules used to train the model.

24f33ee8baef7632fcfbd951453cdca761bc6a47,10.2147/HMER.S74612,The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease,"Thrombocytopenia is the most common hematological abnormality encountered in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). In addition to being an indicator of advanced disease and poor prognosis, it frequently prevents crucial interventions. Historically, thrombocytopenia has been attributed to hypersplenism, which is the increased pooling of platelets in a spleen enlarged by congestive splenomegaly secondary to portal hypertension. Over the past decade, however, there have been significant advances in the understanding of thrombopoiesis, which, in turn, has led to an improved understanding of thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis. Multiple factors contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia and these can broadly be divided into those that cause decreased production, splenic sequestration, and increased destruction. Depressed thrombopoietin levels in CLD, together with direct bone marrow suppression, result in a reduced rate of platelet production. Thrombopoietin regulates both platelet production and maturation and is impaired in CLD. Bone marrow suppression can be caused by viruses, alcohol, iron overload, and medications. Splenic sequestration results from hypersplenism. The increased rate of platelet destruction in cirrhosis also occurs through a number of pathways: increased shear stress, increased fibrinolysis, bacterial translocation, and infection result in an increased rate of platelet aggregation, while autoimmune disease and raised titers of antiplatelet immunoglobulin result in the immunologic destruction of platelets. An in-depth understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the thrombocytopenia of CLD is crucial when considering treatment strategies. This review outlines the recent advances in our understanding of thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis and CLD.",Hepatic Medicine : Evidence and Research,journal,f9943cca-95da-44eb-bf56-ca4c7e68ecdf,Hepatic Medicine : Evidence and Research,39 - 50,8,,2016,2016-04-15 00:00:00,"Oscar J L Mitchell, David M.

When reporting overall CS rates, Blacks and other minorities are typically reported to have high CS rates but comparing overall CS rates may be misleading as CS may be more common in some higher risk populations. Improved understanding of how CS rates differ by race among standardized groups could highlight differences in care and areas for improvement. The current study examines racial differences in cesarean section delivery rates using the Robson Ten-Group Classification System in a nationwide sample. Data from US vital statistics live birth certificates were used to identify 3,906,088 births which were each classified into one of the ten groups based on five obstetric characteristics identifiable on presentation for delivery including parity, onset of labor, gestational age, fetal presentation, and number of fetuses. Results indicated that Black and Asian mothers had the highest CS rates in groups 1–4 which all contain single, cephalic pregnancies at term with no prior CS and are only differentiated by parity and onset of labor. Black mothers also had the lowest CS rates for groups 6 and 7, containing women with nulliparous and multiparous breech births. Black and Asian mothers show differences in CS rates among groups that could indicate lack of appropriate care. Efforts should be made to prevent unnecessary primary CS among low-risk mothers.",Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities,journal,f41df924-72aa-40d4-8a9f-c3c8a129c1fb,Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities,844 - 851,8,,2020,2020-08-17 00:00:00,Elise G.

Furthermore, we investigate a method to counteract the effect of false negative predictions by AI—resulting in an extremely and dangerously long RTAT, as CXRs are sorted to the end of the worklist. We developed a simulation framework that models the current workflow at a university hospital by incorporating hospital-specific CXR generation rates and reporting rates and pathology distribution. Using this, we simulated the standard worklist processing “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) and compared it with a worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was performed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass, and foreign object. Furthermore, we introduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest urgency is assigned to the examination. The average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all prioritization simulations compared to the FIFO simulation (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6 min vs. 80.1 min; p < 0.0001), while the maximum RTAT for most findings increased at the same time (e.g., pneumothorax: 1293 min vs 890 min; p < 0.0001). Our “upper limit” substantially reduced the maximum RTAT in all classes (e.g., pneumothorax: 979 min vs. 1293 min/1178 min; p < 0.0001). Our simulations demonstrate that smart worklist prioritization by AI can reduce the average RTAT for critical findings in CXRs while maintaining a small maximum RTAT as FIFO. • Development of a realistic clinical workflow simulator based on empirical data from a hospital allowed precise assessment of smart worklist prioritization using artificial intelligence. • Employing a smart worklist prioritization without a threshold for maximum waiting time runs the risk of false negative predictions of the artificial intelligence greatly increasing the report turnaround time. • Use of a state-of-the-art convolution neural network can reduce the average report turnaround time almost to the upper limit of a perfect classification algorithm (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6 min vs. 30.4 min).",European Radiology,journal,47f41409-58e8-4cf2-b8cb-2470d27e901a,European Radiology,3837 - 3845,31,,2020,2020-01-23 00:00:00,"I.

However, it is associated with a higher risk of complications, especially when performed without a clear medical indication. Since labour attendants have no standardised clinical method to assist in this decision, statistical tools developed based on multiple labour variables may be an alternative. The objective of this paper was to develop and evaluate the accuracy of models for caesarean section prediction using maternal and foetal characteristics collected at admission and through labour.MethodThis is a secondary analysis of the World Health Organization’s Better Outcomes in Labour Difficulty prospective cohort study in two sub-Saharan African countries. Data were collected from women admitted for labour and childbirth in 13 hospitals in Nigeria as well as Uganda between 2014 and 2015. We applied logistic regression to develop different models to predict caesarean section, based on the time when intrapartum assessment was made. To evaluate discriminatory capacity of the various models, we calculated: area under the curve, diagnostic accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity.ResultsA total of 8957 pregnant women with 12.67% of caesarean births were used for model development. The model based on labour admission characteristics showed an area under the curve of 78.70%, sensitivity of 63.20%, specificity of 78.68% and accuracy of 76.62%. On the other hand, the models that applied intrapartum assessments performed better, with an area under the curve of 93.66%, sensitivity of 80.12%, specificity of 89.26% and accuracy of 88.03%.ConclusionIt is possible to predict the likelihood of intrapartum caesarean section with high accuracy based on labour characteristics and events. However, the accuracy of this prediction is considerably higher when based on information obtained throughout the course of labour.",Reproductive Health,journal,7eda7c14-9c97-4eac-b0ed-6d00aaf5d80f,Reproductive Health,,16,,2019,2019-11-14 00:00:00,"H.

Hispanic cesarean rates were higher than non-Hispanic white rates in the US in 2016. In 2009, cesarean rates among Hispanics on the US-Mexico border exceeded rates among US Hispanics. Since 2009, rates have declined nationwide, but border Hispanic rates have not been studied. Objective To compare cesarean delivery rates and trends in Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in border and nonborder counties of the four US border states before and after 2009. Study Design We used data from birth certificates to calculate percentages of cesarean deliveries among all births and births to low-risk nulliparous women during 2000–2015, and among births to low-risk women with and without a previous cesarean during 2009–2015. We calculated 95% confidence intervals around rates and used regular and piecewise linear regression to estimate trends for four ethnic-geographic subpopulations defined by combinations of Hispanic ethnicity and border-nonborder status. Results Of the four subpopulations, border Hispanic rates were highest every year for all cesarean outcomes. In 2015 they were 38.3% overall, 31.4% among low-risk nulliparous women, and 21.1% and 94.6% among low-risk women without and with a previous cesarean, respectively. Nonborder Hispanic rates in 2015 were lowest for all outcomes but repeat cesarean. Rates for all four subpopulations rose steadily during 2000–2009. Unlike rates for non-Hispanic whites, border and nonborder Hispanic rates did not decline post-2009. Most of the border Hispanic excess can be attributed to higher cesarean rates in Texas. Discussion Border Hispanic cesarean rates remain higher than those among other Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in border states and show no signs of declining. This continuing disparity warrants further analysis using individual as well as hospital, environmental and other contextual factors to help target prevention measures.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,13,,2018,2018-09-05 00:00:00,"Jill A.

Zamzama gas field demonstrates the complex nature of lithofacies due to the heterogeneous nature of the reservoir formation, while it is quite challenging to identify the lithofacies. Using our machine learning approach and cluster analysis, we can not only resolve these difficulties, but also minimize their time-consuming aspects and provide an accurate result even when the user is inexperienced. To constrain accurate reservoir models, rock type identification is a critical step in reservoir characterization. Many empirical and statistical methodologies have been established based on the effect of rock type on reservoir performance. Only well-logged data are provided, and no cores are sampled. Given these circumstances, and the fact that traditional methods such as regression are intractable, we have chosen to apply three strategies: (1) using a self-organizing map (SOM) to arrange depth intervals with similar facies into clusters; (2) clustering to split various facies into specific zones; and (3) the cluster analysis technique is used to identify rock type. In the Zamzama gas field, SOM and cluster analysis techniques discovered four group of facies, each of which was internally comparable in petrophysical properties but distinct from the others. Gamma Ray (GR), Effective Porosity(eff), Permeability (Perm) and Water Saturation (Sw) are used to generate these results. The findings and behavior of four facies shows that facies-01 and facies-02 have good characteristics for acting as gas-bearing sediments, whereas facies-03 and facies-04 are non-reservoir sediments. The outcomes of this study stated that facies-01 is an excellent rock-type zone in the reservoir of the Zamzama gas field.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,,2022,2022-06-20 00:00:00,"M.

 Accurate long-term inflow forecasts are essential for optimal planning of hydropower production. In snow-rich regions, where spring snowmelt is often the largest reservoir of water, inflow forecasts may be improved by assimilating snow observations to achieve more accurate initial states for the hydrological models prior to the prognosis. In this study, we test whether an ensemble Kalman based approach is useful for this purpose for a mountainous catchment in Norway. For 15 years, annual snow observations near peak accumulation at three locations were assimilated into a distributed hydrological model. After the update, the model was run for a 4-month forecasting period with inflows compared to a base case scenario that omitted the snow observations. The assimilation framework improved the forecasts in several years, and in two of the years, the improvement was very large compared to the base case simulation. At the same time, the filter did not degrade the forecasts largely, indicating that though the updating might slightly degrade performance in some years, it maintains the potential for large improvements in others. Thus, the framework proposed here is a viable method for improving snow-related deficiencies in the initial states, which translates to better forecasts.",Hydrology Research,journal,e84b6fe8-b23b-4d24-ae72-5f51e785829f,Hydrology Research,,,,2020,2020-03-17 00:00:00,"J.

It can meet the complementary needs of various energy sources such as cold, thermal, and electricity in industrial parks; can realize multi-energy complements and centralized energy supplies; and can further improve the use efficiency of energy. However, with the extensive access of renewable energy, the uncertainty and intermittentness of renewable energy power generation will greatly reduce the use efficiency of renewable energy and the supply flexibility of IES so as to increase the operational risk of the system operator. With the goal of minimum sum of the system-operating cost and the carbon-emission penalty cost, this paper analyzes the combined supply of cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) influence on system efficiency, compared with the traditional IES. The flexible modified IES realizes the decoupling of cooling, thermal, and electricity; enhances the flexibility of the IES in a variety of energy supply; at the same time, improves the use efficiency of multi-energy; and reasonably avoids the occurrence of energy loss and resource waste. With the aim of reducing the risk that the access of renewable energy may bring to the IES, this paper introduces the fuzzy c-mean-clustering comprehensive quality (FCM-CCQ) algorithm, which is a novel method superior to the general clustering method and performs cluster analysis on the output scenarios of wind power and photovoltaic. Meanwhile, conditional value at risk (CVaR) theory is added to control the system operation risk, which is rarely applied in the field of IES optimization. The model is simulated in a numerical example, and the results demonstrate that the availability and applicability of the presented model are verified. In addition, the carbon dioxide emission of the traditional operation mode; thermoelectric decoupling operation mode; and cooling, thermal, and electricity decoupling operation mode of the IES decrease successively. The system flexibility is greatly enhanced, and the energy-use rate of the system is improved as a whole. Finally, IES, after its flexible transformation, significantly achieve energy conservation, emission reduction, and environmental protection.",Sustainability,journal,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,,2019,2019-09-28 00:00:00,"Hang Liu, Shilin Nie","2118959347, 117893116",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a04e436d2c0f7cf063c8805595b1060faa64e5a1,"Economics, Engineering, Environmental Science",2118959347,,13.0,43.0

The primary challenge in this domain is measuring similarity or distance between networks based on topology. However, classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on differences between either node or edge measurements or correlations without considering the topology of networks such as the connected components or holes. In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning based methods have become popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent homology (PH) is a mathematical tool in computational topology that measures the topological features of data that persist across multiple scales with applications ranging from biological networks to social networks. In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of using PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH, review different methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and highlight different algorithms and applications where PH is used in solving network mining problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions. We conclude with directions for future work. We focus our review on recent approaches that get significant attention in the mathematics and data mining communities working on network data. We believe our summary of the analysis of PH on networks will provide important insights to researchers in applied network science.",Applied Network Science,journal,053991d8-efbc-4f58-8a74-fe6f1665fb40,Applied Network Science,,4,,2019,2019-07-19 00:00:00,"M.

However, the lifetime of WSNs is extremely restricted due to the delimited energy capacity of their sensor nodes. This is why energy conservation is considered as the most important research concern for WSNs. Radio communication is the utmost energy consuming function in a WSN. Thus, energy efficient routing is necessitated to save energy and thus prolong the lifetime of WSNs. For this reason, numerous protocols for energy efficient routing in WSNs have been proposed. This article offers an analytical and up to date survey on the protocols of this kind. The classic and modern protocols presented are categorized, depending on i) how the network is structured, ii) how data are exchanged, iii) whether location information is or not used, and iv) whether Quality of Service (QoS) or multiple paths are or not supported. In each distinct category, protocols are both described and compared in terms of specific performance metrics, while their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Finally, the study findings are discussed, concluding remarks are drawn, and open research issues are indicated.",Algorithms,journal,e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,72,13,,2020,2020-03-24 00:00:00,"C.

Emerging immunotherapeutic approaches have ignited fresh optimism for patient outcomes. This investigation probes the link between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC through Mendelian Randomization and single-cell sequencing, aiming to unearth viable drug targets and dissect HCC's etiology. Methods: We conducted an exhaustive two-sample Mendelian Randomization analysis to ascertain the causal links between immune cell features and HCC, utilizing publicly accessible genetic datasets to explore the causal connections of 731 immune cell traits with HCC susceptibility. The integrity, diversity, and potential horizontal pleiotropy of these findings were rigorously assessed through extensive sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing was employed to penetrate the pathogenic underpinnings of HCC. Results: Establishing a significance threshold of pval_Inverse.variance.weighted at 0.05, our study pinpointed five immune characteristics potentially elevating HCC risk: B cell % CD3- lymphocyte (TBNK panel), CD25 on IgD+ (B cell panel), HVEM on TD CD4+ (Maturation stages of T cell panel), CD14 on CD14+ CD16- monocyte (Monocyte panel), CD4 on CD39+ activated Treg ( Treg panel). Conversely, various cellular phenotypes tied to BAFF-R expression emerged as protective elements. Single-cell sequencing unveiled profound immune cell phenotype interactions, highlighting marked disparities in cell communication and metabolic activities. Conclusion: Leveraging MR and scRNA-seq techniques, our study elucidates potential associations between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC, offering a window into the molecular interplays among cellular phenotypes, and addressing the limitations of mono-antibody therapeutic targets.",Journal of Cancer,journal,3120f100-cfa2-4130-bd3d-fc7b1a04ca48,Journal of Cancer,4219 - 4231,15,,2024,2024-06-03 00:00:00,"Jingyi Tang, Shengke Zhang, Lai Jiang, Jie Liu, Jiayu Xu, Chenglu Jiang, Zipei Chen, Xuancheng Zhou, Claire Fuller, Jinbang Huang, Haiqing Chen, Guanhu Yang, Changsong Bai, Defeng Yin, Bo Li, Hao Chi","2290390357, 2261234215, 2244275006, 2290194060, 2276273257, 2220921654, 2290165950, 2276208210, 2303621918, 2230909440, 2244805960, 2244586130, 2307483379, 2261459373, 2308045663, 2244316010",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58dc6f8c942361560fa67583eb2d852e433b8402,"Biology, Medicine",2290390357,['JournalArticle'],12.0,66.0

Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional study design, typically used in measurement-related studies. A sample of 167 children, ages 5–11 years (mean ± SD: 8.0 ± 1.8 years), performed up to eight seated sedentary activities while wearing accelerometers on both wrists. Activities included: reading books, sorting cards, cutting and pasting, playing board games, eating snacks, playing with tablets, watching TV, and writing. Direct observation verified sedentary behavior from light activity. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to determine optimal cut-point thresholds. Quantile regression models estimated differences between dominant and non-dominant placement. Results: The optimal cut-point threshold for the non-dominant wrist was 203 counts/5 s with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 71.56, 70.83, and 0.72, respectively. A 10-fold cross-validation revealed an average AUC of 0.70. Statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences in median counts ranging from 7 to 46 counts/5 s were found between dominant and non-dominant placement in five out of eight sedentary activities, with the dominant wrist eliciting higher counts/5 s. Conclusion: Results from this study support the recommendation to place accelerometers on the non-dominant wrist to minimize “noise” during seated sedentary behaviors.",Children,journal,083c6c99-5d39-4452-88c4-2963e15f8a0f,Children,,5,,2018,2018-09-26 00:00:00,"J.

Toddlers’ screen time and personal attributes, physical activity- or screen time-specific parental cognitions and behaviors, and the home and neighborhood environment were measured via parental-report using the PREPS questionnaire. Accelerometry-measured physical activity was available in 123 toddlers. Bayesian estimation in structural equation modeling (SEM) using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was performed to test an SMCB hypothesized model. Covariates included toddlers’ age, sex, race/ethnicity, main type of childcare, and family household income.ResultsIn the SMCB hypothesized screen time model, higher parental barrier self-efficacy for limiting toddlers’ screen time was associated with higher parental screen time limiting practices (β = 0.451), while higher parental negative outcome expectations for limiting toddlers’ screen time was associated with lower parental screen time limiting practices (β = − 0.147). In turn, higher parental screen time limiting practices was associated with lower screen time among toddlers (β = − 0.179). Parental modeling of higher screen time was associated with higher screen time among toddlers directly (β = 0.212) and indirectly through the home environment. Specifically, higher screen time among parents was associated with having at least one electronic device in toddlers’ bedrooms (β = 0.146) and, in turn, having electronics in the bedroom, compared to none, was associated with higher screen time among toddlers (β = 0.250). Neighborhood safety was not associated with toddlers’ screen time in the SEM analysis. No significant correlations were observed between the SMCB variables and toddlers’ physical activity; thus, no further analyses were performed for physical activity.ConclusionsParents and their interactions with the home environment may play an important role in shaping toddlers’ screen time. Findings can inform family-based interventions aiming to minimize toddlers’ screen time. Future research is needed to identify correlates of toddlers’ physical activity.",International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,journal,35cf3eda-f575-4ca2-bc02-eb424addea63,The International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,,15,,2018,2018-02-09 00:00:00,"Eun-Young Lee, K.

Accurate assessment of PA is needed to determine trends/correlates of PA, time spent in sedentary, light, or moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA), and the effectiveness of PA promotion programs. Due to the limited availability of objective measures that have been validated and evaluated for feasibility in community studies, it is unclear which subgroups of toddlers are at the highest risk for inactivity. Using Actical ankle accelerometry, the objectives of this study are to develop valid thresholds, examine feasibility, and examine demographic/ anthropometric PA correlates of MVPA among toddlers from low-income families.MethodsTwo studies were conducted with toddlers (12–36 months). Laboratory Study (n = 24)- Two Actical accelerometers were placed on the ankle. PA was observed using the Child Activity Rating Scale (CARS, prescribed activities). Analyses included device equivalence reliability (correlation: activity counts of two Acticals), criterion-related validity (correlation: activity counts and CARS ratings), and sensitivity/specificity for thresholds. Community Study (n = 277, low-income mother-toddler dyads recruited)- An Actical was worn on the ankle for > 7 days (goal >5, 24-h days). Height/weight was measured. Mothers reported demographics. Analyses included frequencies (feasibility) and stepwise multiple linear regression (sMLR).ResultsLaboratory Study- Acticals demonstrated reliability (r = 0.980) and validity (r = 0.75). Thresholds demonstrated sensitivity (86 %) and specificity (88 %). Community Study- 86 % wore accelerometer, 69 % had valid data (mean = 5.2 days). Primary reasons for missing/invalid data: refusal (14 %) and wear-time ≤2 days (11 %). The MVPA threshold (>2200 cpm) yielded 54 min/day. In sMLR, MVPA was associated with age (older > younger, β = 32.8, p < 0.001), gender (boys > girls, β = −11.21, p = 0.032), maternal MVPA (β = 0.44, p = 0.002) and recruitment location (suburban > urban, β = 19.6, p < 0.001), or race (non-Black > Black, β = 18.5, p = 0.001). No association with toddler weight status.ConclusionsAnkle accelerometry is a valid, reliable, and feasible method of assessing PA in community studies of toddlers from low-income families. Sub-populations of toddlers may be at increased risk for inactivity, including toddlers that are younger, female, Black, those with less active mothers, and those living in an urban location.",BMC Public Health,journal,c81aae02-04bc-4c4d-811c-5043ae130a31,BMC Public Health,,16,,2016,2016-09-06 00:00:00,"E.

But most of the state-of-the-art GCN models are shallow structures with depths of no more than 3 to 4 layers, which greatly limits the ability of GCN models to extract high-level features of nodes. There are two main reasons for this: 1) Overlaying too many graph convolution layers will lead to the problem of over-smoothing. 2) Graph convolution is a kind of localized filter, which is easily affected by local properties. To solve the above problems, we first propose a novel general framework for graph neural networks called Non-local Message Passing (NLMP). Under this framework, very deep graph convolutional networks can be flexibly designed, and the over-smoothing phenomenon can be suppressed very effectively. Second, we propose a new spatial graph convolution layer to extract node multiscale high-level node features. Finally, we design an end-to-end Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network II (DGCNNII) model for graph classification task, which is up to 32 layers deep. And the effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by quantifying the graph smoothness of each layer and ablation studies. Experiments on benchmark graph classification datasets show that DGCNNII outperforms a large number of shallow graph neural network baseline methods.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLOS ONE,,18,,2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,"Yuchen Zhou, Hongtao Huo, Zhiwen Hou, Fanliang Bu","2121226686, 2254164, 2028203888, 2448020",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c582bdbd4787c2f81c999de76445e440a600d835,"Computer Science, Medicine",2121226686,['JournalArticle'],18.0,77.0

With the rapid accumulation of biological network data, GNNs have also become an important tool in bioinformatics. In this research, a systematic survey of GNNs and their advances in bioinformatics is presented from multiple perspectives. We first introduce some commonly used GNN models and their basic principles. Then, three representative tasks are proposed based on the three levels of structural information that can be learned by GNNs: node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. Meanwhile, according to the specific applications for various omics data, we categorize and discuss the related studies in three aspects: disease prediction, drug discovery, and biomedical imaging. Based on the analysis, we provide an outlook on the shortcomings of current studies and point out their developing prospect. Although GNNs have achieved excellent results in many biological tasks at present, they still face challenges in terms of low-quality data processing, methodology, and interpretability and have a long road ahead. We believe that GNNs are potentially an excellent method that solves various biological problems in bioinformatics research.",Frontiers in Genetics,journal,9ec189b3-db0f-41d8-9c82-21ef5fa9b87e,Frontiers in Genetics,,12,,2021,2021-07-29 00:00:00,"Xiao-Meng Zhang, Li Liang, Lin Liu, Mingjing Tang","2128111521, 2155276623, 2146017357, 145481501",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19fd00f8540a5728a21593b2e62e4f9a8abf74d6,"Biology, Computer Science, Medicine",2128111521,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",245.0,165.0

While the machine learning community has generally accepted methods such as k-fold stratified cross-validation (CV) to be more rigorous than single split validation, the standard research practice in medical fields is the use of single split validation techniques. This is especially concerning given the relatively small sample sizes of datasets used for cardiovascular imaging. We aim to examine how train-test split variation impacts the stability of machine learning (ML) model performance estimates in several validation techniques on two real-world cardiovascular imaging datasets: stratified split-sample validation (70/30 and 50/50 train-test splits), tenfold stratified CV, 10 × repeated tenfold stratified CV, bootstrapping (500 × repeated), and leave one out (LOO) validation. We demonstrate that split validation methods lead to the highest range in AUC and statistically significant differences in ROC curves, unlike the other aforementioned approaches. When building predictive models on relatively small data sets as is often the case in medical imaging, split-sample validation techniques can produce instability in performance estimates with variations in range over 0.15 in the AUC values, and thus any of the alternate validation methods are recommended.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,,2021,2021-07-14 00:00:00,"Vikash R Singh, M.

However, the size of the datasets and the train/test split ratios can greatly affect the outcome of the models, and thus the classification performance itself. We compared several combinations of dataset sizes and split ratios with five different machine learning algorithms to find the differences or similarities and to select the best parameter settings in nonbinary (multiclass) classification. It is also known that the models are ranked differently according to the performance merit(s) used. Here, 25 performance parameters were calculated for each model, then factorial ANOVA was applied to compare the results. The results clearly show the differences not just between the applied machine learning algorithms but also between the dataset sizes and to a lesser extent the train/test split ratios. The XGBoost algorithm could outperform the others, even in multiclass modeling. The performance parameters reacted differently to the change of the sample set size; some of them were much more sensitive to this factor than the others. Moreover, significant differences could be detected between train/test split ratios as well, exerting a great effect on the test validation of our models.",Molecules,journal,91b19bbf-b6f0-46c2-bbec-6bcfb5463d4d,Molecules,,26,,2021,2021-02-01 00:00:00,"Anita Rácz, D.

Despite its potential to transform current pedagogies and learning experiences through engaging, interactive, and fascinating educational techniques, research is limited in exploring its application, usability, and user experience, particularly for Thai undergraduate students in learning computer engineering courses. In response, we designed and developed an innovative metaverse-based learning system called the AIIS collaborative learning interface, tailored to European undergraduate students. While the original intent of AIIS was to cater to medical students, in this study, our objective was to assess its usability and applicability for computer science and engineering students, specifically focusing on the Asian demographic. After an initial pilot with European students in their local context, the research was extended to Thailand, where 21 Thai undergraduate students evaluated the platform’s usability. The observations from this study indicate that AIIS provides a dynamic, user-friendly learning environment. Nevertheless, the evaluation process unveiled some usability flaws that offer informative directions for future enhancements. Drawing from our observations, we formulated usability guidelines to guide designers and developers toward crafting more efficient metaverse systems, particularly those intended for educational use.

Developing reconfigurable fiber-based memristors is an efficient method to realize electronic textiles that capable of neuromorphic computing function. However, the previously reported artificial synapse and neuron need different materials and configurations, making it difficult to realize multiple functions in a single device. Herein, a textile memristor network of Ag/MoS2/HfAlOx/carbon nanotube with reconfigurable characteristics was reported, which can achieve both nonvolatile synaptic plasticity and volatile neuron functions. In addition, a single reconfigurable memristor can realize integrate-and-fire function, exhibiting significant advantages in reducing the complexity of neuron circuits. The firing energy consumption of fiber-based memristive neuron is 1.9 fJ/spike (femtojoule-level), which is at least three orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported biological and artificial neuron (picojoule-level). The ultralow energy consumption makes it possible to create an electronic neural network that reduces the energy consumption compared to human brain. By integrating the reconfigurable synapse, neuron and heating resistor, a smart textile system is successfully constructed for warm fabric application, providing a unique functional reconfiguration pathway toward the next-generation in-memory computing textile system. Neuromorphic computing memristors are attractive to construct low-power- consumption electronic textiles.

However, such interstitial doping inevitably leads to lattice microstrain that impairs the long-range ordering and stability of the crystals, causing a sacrificial trade-off. Here, we unravel the evident influence of the valence states of the interstitial cations on their efficacy to suppress the ion migration. Incorporation of a trivalent neodymium cation (Nd3+) effectively mitigates the ion migration in the perovskite lattice with a reduced dosage (0.08%) compared to a widely used monovalent cation dopant (Na+, 0.45%). The photovoltaic performances and operational stability of the prototypical perovskite solar cells are enhanced with a trace amount of Nd3+ doping while minimizing the sacrificial trade-off. Ion migration has a detrimental effect on the performance and stability of halide perovskite optoelectronics. Here, the authors incorporated a small dosage of high-valence neodymium cation to suppress this, with a minimal impact on the lattice microstrain.",Nature Materials,journal,2cc29e11-7fb1-434f-bc7c-efbf9e64672a,Nature Materials,1396 - 1402,21,,2022,2022-11-17 00:00:00,"Yepin Zhao, I.

This paper proposes a biomimetic ocular prosthesis system that mimics the human light modulation response capable of pupil and corneal reflections. First, photoinduced synaptic properties of the quantum dot embedded photonic synapse and its biosimilar signal transmission is confirmed. Subsequently, the pupillary light reflex is emulated by incorporating the quantum dot embedded photonic synapse, electrochromic device, and CMOS components. Moreover, a solenoid-based eyelid is connected to the pupillary light reflex system to emulate the corneal reflex. The proposed ocular prosthesis system represents a platform for biomimetic prosthesis that can accommodate an appropriate amount of stimulus by self-regulating the intensity of external stimuli.

To date, several artificial haptic-based sensing techniques can accurately measure physical stimuli. However, quantifying the psychological parameters of tactile perception to achieve texture and roughness identification remains challenging. Here, we developed a smart finger with surpassed human tactile perception, which enabled accurate identification of material type and roughness through the integration of triboelectric sensing and machine learning. In principle, as each material has different capabilities to gain or lose electrons, a unique triboelectric fingerprint output will be generated when the triboelectric sensor is in contact with the measured object. The construction of a triboelectric sensor array could further eliminate interference from the environment, and the accuracy rate of material identification was as high as 96.8%. The proposed smart finger provides the possibility to impart artificial tactile perception to manipulators or prosthetics.",Science Advances,journal,cb30f0c9-2980-4b7d-bbcb-68fc5472b97c,Science Advances,,8,,2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,"Xuecheng Qu, Zhuo Liu, Puchuan Tan, Chan Wang, Ying Liu, Hongqing Feng, Danling Luo, Zhou Li, Z.

In general, vast amounts of data are collected from various sensors in an IIoT environment, and they are analyzed to prevent failures by predicting their occurrence. However, the collected data may include data irrelevant to failures and thereby decrease the prediction accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a failure prediction model using iterative feature selection. To build the model, the relevancy between each feature (i.e., each sensor) and the failure was analyzed using the random forest algorithm, to obtain the importance of the features. Then, feature selection and model building were conducted iteratively. In each iteration, a new feature was selected considering the importance and added to the selected feature set. The failure prediction model was built for each iteration via the support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the failure prediction model having the highest prediction accuracy was selected. The experimental implementation was conducted using open-source R. The results showed that the proposed failure prediction model achieved high prediction accuracy.",Symmetry,journal,1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,454,12,,2020,2020-03-12 00:00:00,"Jung-Hyok Kwon, Eui-Jik Kim","2409351, 121855842",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8a6b4f30728cb9d92f589644988396f54e7cc12,"Computer Science, Engineering",2409351,['JournalArticle'],10.0,36.0

From this point, we propose an efficient system that applies sentiment analysis of COVID-19 news and articles to extract the final impact of COVID-19 on the financial stock market. In this paper, we propose a stock market prediction system that extracts the stock movement with the COVID spread. It is important to predict the effect of these diseases on the economy to be ready for any disease change and protect our economy. In this paper, we apply sentimental analysis to stock news headlines to predict the daily future trend of stock in the COVID-19 period. Also, we use machine learning classifiers to predict the final impact of COVID-19 on some stocks such as TSLA, AMZ, and GOOG stock. For improving the performance and quality of future trend predictions, feature selection and spam tweet reduction are performed on the data sets. Finally, our proposed system is a hybrid system that applies text mining on social media data mining on the historical stock dataset to improve the whole prediction performance. The proposed system predicts stock movement for TSLA, AMZ, and GOOG with average prediction accuracy of 90%, 91.6%, and 92.3% respectively.",Multimedia tools and applications,journal,477368e9-7a8e-475a-8c93-6d623797fd06,Multimedia Tools and Applications,1 - 33,,,2022,2022-11-28 00:00:00,"M.

These indicators are based on three broad categories of technical analysis: Price, Volume, and Turnover. Various error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) have been used to check the performance of the models. Results show that the XGBoost algorithm performs best among the four ensemble models. The mean of absolute error and the root-mean-square -error vary around 3–5%. The feature importance plots generated by the models depict the importance of the variables in predicting the output. The proposed machine learning models help traders, investors, as well as portfolio managers, better predict the stock market trends and, in turn, the returns, particularly in banking stocks minimizing their sole dependency on macroeconomic factors. The techniques further assist the market participants in pre-empting any price-volume action across stocks irrespective of their size, liquidity, or past turnover. Finally, the techniques are incredibly robust and display a strong capability in predicting trend forecasts, particularly with any large deviations.",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,journal,5bccd387-3836-42f2-9b60-9c190333ae01,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,,,2022,2022-08-07 00:00:00,"S.

The coordination of gait movement is directly affected by the cooperation and functional connectivity between muscles. However, the mechanisms of muscle operation at different gait speeds remain unclear. Therefore, this study addressed the gait speed effect on the changes in cooperative modules and functional connectivity between muscles. To this end, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals were collected from eight key lower extremity muscles of twelve healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at high, middle, and low motion speeds. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) was applied to the sEMG envelope and intermuscular coherence matrix, yielding five muscle synergies. Muscle functional networks were constructed by decomposing the intermuscular coherence matrix, revealing different layers of functional muscle networks across frequencies. In addition, the coupling strength between cooperative muscles grew with gait speed. Different coordination patterns among muscles with changes in gait speed related to the neuromuscular system regulation were identified.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering,journal,416b088d-de72-4dbf-959e-8551984d9676,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,1230-1237,31,,2023,2023-02-06 00:00:00,"Tie Liang, Huacong Miao, Hongrui Wang, Xiaoguang Liu, Xiuling Liu","2112369139, 2204823453, 2109234009, 2109010804, 2109305689",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf75253c6ec3360d80c0ccd9ea7202af2d63710d,"Engineering, Medicine",2112369139,['JournalArticle'],7.0,46.0

This cross-sectional analysis explored the association between geriatric obesity and education level, along with other demographic characteristics in Taipei, Taiwan between 2013 and 2015. Taipei citizens ≥ 65 years (aborigines ≥ 55 years) were recruited to participate in the elderly health examination programme. Logistic regression was applied to analyse the relationship between obesity (defined as body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m2 in Taiwan) and education level among men and women after controlling for age, race, income status, and smoking status. A total of 28,092 men and 31,835 women were included in the final analysis. Compared to those with education years ≥ 16, older men and women with education years ≤ 12 had higher odds of being obese. The odds ratios increase as years of education decrease, and the trend is more pronounced among women. Aborigines had much higher chances of being obese among men and women, while there were no differences by income status. The results clarified the factors related to obesity in the elderly, and will be useful for authorities working to improve health outcomes among this population.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,,2020,2020-11-20 00:00:00,"Tsai-Hao Hsieh, J.

In this exploratory research, we investigated the concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors including smoking, body mass index, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake, and alcohol use within African American heterosexual couples. We also examined whether females’ stress is associated with their own (actor effect) and males’ cancer-related lifestyle factors (partner effect), and vice versa. We analyzed a total of 216 heterosexual couples (i.e., N = 432 individuals) recruited from black churches. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated and multilevel modeling in which individuals are nested within couples was conducted. Results showed that there was high concordance of body mass index (ICC = 1.68, p < .001), fruit and vegetable intake (ICC = 1.62, p < .001), red meat intake (ICC = 1.50, p = .001), and alcohol use (ICC = 1.74, p < .001) between spouses. A multilevel analysis showed that there were actor and partner effects of stress on females’ BMI; females’ stress was positively associated with their own BMI (actor effect; β = .42, p = .006) and males’ stress was positively associated with females’ BMI (partner effect; β = .39, p = .026). Also, females’ stress was positively associated with their own red meat intake (actor effect; β = .20, p = .019). In conclusion, high concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors (BMI, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake and alcohol use) exists between African American spouses. Given the identified actor and partner effects of stress on females’ BMI, a couple-based lifestyle or weight management intervention that targets both male and female spouses’ stress and coping will be promising, particularly to enhance African American women’s health behaviors. Future studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying concordance and discordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors in African American couples. Also, factors that explain African American male spouses’ health behaviors need to be uncovered.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,15,,2020,2020-05-08 00:00:00,"Dalnim Cho, K.

890b48679c66495c58c181665f9d313a2dd1ef79,10.3390/ijms21010123,Interaction of Osteoarthritis and BMI on Leptin Promoter Methylation in Taiwanese Adults,"Leptin (LEP) regulates glucose metabolism and energy storage in the body. Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with the upregulation of serum LEP. LEP promoter methylation is associated with obesity. So far, few studies have explored the association of BMI and OA with LEP methylation. We assessed the interaction between body mass index (BMI) and OA on LEP promoter methylation. Data of 1114 participants comprising 583 men and 558 women, aged 30–70 years were retrieved from the Taiwan Biobank Database (2008–2015). Osteoarthritis was self-reported and cases were those who reported having ever been clinically diagnosed with osteoarthritis. BMI was categorized into underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. The mean LEP promoter methylation level in individuals with osteoarthritis was 0.5509 ± 0.00437 and 0.5375 ± 0.00101 in those without osteoarthritis. The interaction between osteoarthritis and BMI on LEP promoter methylation was significant (p-value = 0.0180). With normal BMI as the reference, the mean LEP promoter methylation level was significantly higher in obese osteoarthritic individuals (β = 0.03696, p-value = 0.0187). However, there was no significant association between BMI and LEP promoter methylation in individuals without osteoarthritis, regardless of BMI. In conclusion, only obesity was significantly associated with LEP promoter methylation (higher levels) specifically in osteoarthritic patients.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,21,,2019,2019-12-23 00:00:00,"Tzi-Peng Yang, Hsiao-Mei Chen, Chao-Chin Hu, Li-Yuan Chen, F.

An International Retrospective Cohort Study,"Abstract BACKGROUND Despite our inability to accurately predict survival in many cancer patients, a life expectancy of at least 3 mo is historically necessary to be considered for surgical treatment of spinal metastases. OBJECTIVE To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients surviving <3 mo after surgical treatment to patients surviving >3 mo to assess the validity of this inclusion criteria. METHODS Patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastases between August 2013 and May 2017 were retrospectively identified from an international cohort study. HRQOL was evaluated using generic and disease-specific outcome tools at baseline and at 6 and 12 wk postsurgery. The primary outcome was the HRQOL at 6 wk post-treatment measured by the Spine Oncology Study Group Outcomes Questionnaire (SOSGOQ). RESULTS A total of 253 patients were included: 40 patients died within the first 3 mo after surgery and 213 patients survived more than 3 mo. Patients surviving <3 mo after surgery presented with lower baseline performance status. Adjusted analyses for baseline performance status did not reveal a significant difference in HRQOL between both groups at 6 wk post-treatment. No significant difference in patient satisfaction at 6 wk with regard to their treatment could be detected between both groups. CONCLUSION When controlled for baseline performance status, quality of life 6 wk after surgery for spinal metastasis is independent of survival. To optimize improvement in HRQOL for this patient population, baseline performance status should take priority over expected survival in the surgical decision-making process.",Neurosurgery,journal,396750b3-c753-4765-b283-ca20a4ddd616,Neurosurgery,303 - 311,87,,2019,2019-11-06 00:00:00,"N.

The lower productivity exhibited by these SMEs in Sri Lanka was identified as a result of the high participation rate of female entrepreneurs in the informal economy. An unfavourable environment has been created obstructing the transition of women entrepreneurs towards the upper echelon of the business world through diverse impediments. Thus, the research focused on exploring the barriers that hinder the business growth of women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises. Accordingly, the research was conducted as secondary research: a literature survey. In Sri Lanka, a minor percentage of female participation in small and medium enterprises occurs due to limited access to financial resources, lack of financial literacy, social prejudices, social and cultural restrictions, and limited opportunities for networking and communicating with external resources. Thus, closing the gender gap in education, giving access to capital through a concerted policy action and providing women entrepreneurs with opportunities to improve their financial literacy and educational level were highlighted as the major recommendations in the study to empower women entrepreneurs to climb the value chain. Women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises need to be facilitated with greater access to the domestic, regional and international markets in order to enable them to expand their businesses with productivity and innovation. Thus, vital policy measures should be taken to mitigate the barriers involved in formalizing the business mechanisms while focusing on increasing the benefits that women entrepreneurs can gain through that standardizing process.",Kelaniya Journal of Management,journal,ec75610f-5ca7-442a-a9be-eaa05bffd2b7,Kelaniya Journal of Management,,,,2024,2024-04-30 00:00:00,"D.

 In addition to the influence of climate change on water availability and hydrological risks, the effects on water quality are in the early stages of investigations. This study aims to consolidate the latest interdisciplinary research in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of assessment of water quality parameters and its prediction. This research paper specifically explores the intricate relationship between climate change and water quality parameters at Sandia station, situated within the Narmada basin in Central India. As global climatic patterns continue to shift, the repercussions on water resources have gained prominence. In this work, electrical conductivity is predicted using the KERAS data processing environment on TensorFlow. The root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), etc. are calculated between observed and predicted values to assess the model performance. A total of 10 models are developed depending upon the input geometry from past monthly timelines. The results indicate that Model no. 8, with 10 inputs performs the best based on the R2 value of 0.889. These results indicate that AI can be very helpful in analyzing the possible threats in the future for drinking, water, livestock feeding, irrigation, and so on.",Journal of Water and Climate Change,journal,3ab6c231-a535-47cb-9af7-b55c4fe50642,Journal of Water and Climate Change,,,,2024,2024-02-19 00:00:00,"Deepak Kumar Tiwari, K.

In addition to the precipitation and other meteorological time series, catchment characteristics, including soil data, land use, land cover, and roughness, are essential in most hydrologic models. The unavailability of these data series challenged the accuracy of simulations. However, recent advances in soft computing techniques offer better approaches and solutions at less computational complexity. These require a minimum amount of data, while they reach higher accuracies depending on the quality of data sets. The Gradient Boosting Algorithms and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are two such systems that can be used in simulating river flows based on the catchment rainfall. In this paper, the computational capabilities of these two systems were tested in simulated river flows by developing the prediction models for Malwathu Oya in Sri Lanka. The simulated flows were then compared with the ground-measured river flows for accuracy. Correlation of coefficient (R), Per cent-Bias (bias), Nash Sutcliffe Model efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root mean square error (RMSE) were used as the comparative indices between Gradient Boosting Algorithms and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference Systems. Results of the study showcased that both systems can simulate river flows as a function of catchment rainfalls; however, the Cat gradient Boosting algorithm (CatBoost) has a computational edge over the Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The CatBoost algorithm outperformed other algorithms used in this study, with the best correlation score for the testing dataset having 0.9934. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Light gradient boosting (LightGBM), and Ensemble models scored 0.9283, 0.9253, and 0.9109, respectively. However, more applications should be investigated for sound conclusions.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLOS ONE,,18,,2023,2023-04-26 00:00:00,"Namal Rathnayake, Upaka S.

Parental distress caused by economic pressure may increase violence against children. High levels of gender inequality and interpersonal violence may contribute to higher levels of physical abuse. Using an ecological perspective, this study examines the association of country-level gender inequality and household-level parental physical abuse, and the moderating role of child gender in this association in low- and middle-income countries. We used data on over 420,000 households from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and country-level indicators from the United Nations Development Program Human Development data. We employed multilevel logistic regression to examine the association between gender inequality with the log-odds of physical abuse after accounting for country- and individual-level covariates. In order to more fully explore our results, we calculated predicted probabilities of abuse for several scenarios. The results indicated that higher levels of gender inequality were associated with higher probabilities of physical abuse. This association was stronger for female children than for male children. The probabilities of abuse by child gender were indistinguishable, although rates of physical abuse converged as gender inequality increased, at a statistically marginal level. These findings indicate that macro-level interventions that reduce gender inequality are necessary to prevent and reduce child physical abuse.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,19,,2022,2022-09-21 00:00:00,"Julie Ma, Andrew C.

Different representations of the dispatching rules in the literature are newly proposed in this paper and are compared and analysed. Experimental results show that the representation that integrates system and machine attributes can improve the quality of the evolved rules.

Authors of this paper while searching for possible solutions for medical context learning found that unified corpora tagged with medical nomenclature was missing to train the analytics for medical context learning. Therefore, here we demonstrated a mechanism to come up with uniform NER (Named Entity Recognition) tagged medical corpora that is fed with 14407 endocrine patients’ dataset in CSV format diagnosed with DM and comorbidity diseases. The other corpus is of ICD-10-CM coding scheme in text format taken from www.icd10data.com. ICD-10-CM corpus is to be tagged for understanding the medical context with uniformity for which we are conducting different experiments using common NLP techniques and frameworks like; TensorFlow, Keras, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. 
In our preliminary experiments albeit label sets in form of (instance, label) pair were tagged with Sequential() model formed on TensorFlow.Keras and Bi-LSTM NLP algorithms.

Efficiently programming these systems has become a major challenge due to the complexity of their architectures and the efforts required to provide them with co-execution capabilities that can fully exploit the applications. There are many proposals to simplify the programming and management of acceleration devices and multi-core CPUs. However, in many cases, portability and ease of use compromise the efficiency of different devices—even more so when co-executing. Intel oneAPI, a new and powerful standards-based unified programming model, built on top of SYCL, addresses these issues. In this paper, oneAPI is provided with co-execution strategies to run the same kernel between different devices, enabling the exploitation of static and dynamic policies. This work evaluates the performance and energy efficiency for a well-known set of regular and irregular HPC benchmarks, using two heterogeneous systems composed of an integrated GPU and CPU. Static and dynamic load balancers are integrated and evaluated, highlighting single and co-execution strategies and the most significant key points of this promising technology. Experimental results show that co-execution is worthwhile when using dynamic algorithms and improves the efficiency even further when using unified shared memory.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2021,2021-09-29 00:00:00,"Raúl Nozal, J.

This study aimed to develop and determine the accuracy of detecting different ADLs using machine-learning (ML) algorithms and wearable sensors. Eleven post-stroke patients participated in this pilot study at an ADL Simulation Lab across two study visits. We collected blocks of repeated activity (“atomic” activity) performance data to train our ML algorithms during one visit. We evaluated our ML algorithms using independent semi-naturalistic activity data collected at a separate session. We tested Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for model development. XGBoost was the best classification model. We achieved 82% accuracy based on ten ADL tasks. With a model including seven tasks, accuracy improved to 90%. ADL tasks included chopping food, vacuuming, sweeping, spreading jam or butter, folding laundry, eating, brushing teeth, taking off/putting on a shirt, wiping a cupboard, and buttoning a shirt. Results provide preliminary evidence that ADL functioning can be predicted with adequate accuracy using wearable sensors and ML. The use of external validation (independent training and testing data sets) and semi-naturalistic testing data is a major strength of the study and a step closer to the long-term goal of ADL monitoring in real-world settings. Further investigation is needed to improve the ADL prediction accuracy, increase the number of tasks monitored, and test the model outside of a laboratory setting.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,18,,2021,2021-02-01 00:00:00,"Pin-Wei Chen, Nathan A.

Reablement is one form of rehabilitative intervention, which aims to restore ADL functions performed in the community. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of home-based reablement from 3 concepts of ADL (ie, actual performance, ability, and self-perceived difficulty) for patients with stroke. Methods: This was a single-blind pilot randomized clinical trial. Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups: home-based reablement group (n = 12) and control group (n = 14). The home-based reablement group received ADL training in the home environment for 6 weeks. The control group received conventional rehabilitation in the hospital. Outcome measures contained the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales (BI-SS). The COPM was applied to identify patients’ level of performance and satisfaction with ADL training. The BI-SS included 3 ADL scales: actual performance, ability, and self-perceived difficulty. Results: The patients in the home-based reablement group showed statistically significant improvements in the ability scale and total score of the BI-SS than the control group (P < .05) and demonstrated moderate effect size (success rate difference = 0.34–0.42). No significant differences were noticed in the COPM and the other 2 scales of the BI-SS (actual performance and self-perceived difficulty), but small effect sizes were found (success rate difference = 0.17–0.22). Conclusions: For patients with stroke, the 6-week home-based reablement program had similar effects with the control group on patients’ perceived performance, satisfaction, and difficulty in ADL, but it displayed potential for enhancing their ability in executing ADL tasks.",Medicine,journal,2ae18de8-1e0b-4f92-9aa3-866ffc4f36e7,Medicine,,99,,2020,2020-12-04 00:00:00,"Der-Sheng Han, Po-Wen Chuang, E.

This present study aimed to investigate the association between stress hyperglycemia and SAP. Methods Patients were screened between February 2013 and August 2020 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. We divided the blood glucose of the patients at admission by the glycated hemoglobin to calculate the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between SAP and SHR, with the confounders being controlled. Further, subgroup analyses were separately performed for stroke patients with and without diabetes. Results A total of 2,039 patients were finally recruited, of which 533 (26.14%) were diagnosed with SAP. SHR were divided into four quartiles in the logistic regression analysis, the highest SHR quartile (SHR ≥ 1.15) indicated a higher risk of SAP (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.13–2.19, p = 0.01) in total patients. In patients without diabetes, the third quantile (SHR = 0.96–1.14) and the highest quantile (SHR ≥ 1.15) were both related to a higher risk of SAP (both p < 0.05). However, we did not find such an association in diabetic patients. Conclusion SHR was significantly associated with the risk of SAP in patients without diabetes. Adequate attention should be paid to the patients with high SHR levels at admission, especially those without diabetes.",Frontiers in Nutrition,journal,7cc3baec-aad9-4726-872c-48bbd0deb798,Frontiers in Nutrition,,9,,2022,2022-02-22 00:00:00,"Jiejie Tao, Zhi-hao Hu, Feiling Lou, Junxin Wu, Zijing Wu, Shuang Yang, Xiaofang Jiang, Meihao Wang, Qiqi Huang, Wenwei Ren","6280080, 27695460, 2127006831, 2146668793, 2109686437, 2157208152, 2144811818, 5344449, 2110653728, 8042920",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4219d642e5104297c8b218904aae0c28625ee10,Medicine,6280080,['JournalArticle'],22.0,51.0

Methods We included 205 patients with HCI from November 2018 to December 2019. The diagnostic criterion for SAP was occurrence within 7 days of the onset of stroke. Poor outcome was defined as a functional outcome based on a 3-months MRS score >3. The relationship of demographic, laboratory and neuroimaging variables with SAP and poor outcome was investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Fifty seven (27.8%) patients were diagnosed with SAP and 40 (19.5%) developed poor outcomes. A2DS2 score (OR = 1.284; 95% CI: 1.048–1.574; P = 0.016), previous stroke (OR = 2.630; 95% CI: 1.122–6.163; P = 0.026), consciousness (OR = 2.945; 95% CI: 1.514–5.729; P < 0.001), brain atrophy (OR = 1.427; 95% CI: 1.040–1.959; P = 0.028), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.715; 95% CI: 1.163–2.528; P = 0.006) were independently associated with the occurrence of SAP. Therefore, we combined these variables into a new SAP prediction model with the C-statistic of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78–0.90). Fasting plasma glucose (OR = 1.404; 95% CI: 1.202–1.640; P < 0.001), NIHSS score (OR = 1.088; 95% CI: 1.010–1.172; P = 0.026), previous stroke (OR = 4.333; 95% CI: 1.645–11.418; P = 0.003), SAP (OR = 3.420; 95% CI: 1.332–8.787; P = 0.011), basal ganglia-dilated perivascular spaces (BG-dPVS) (OR = 2.124; 95% CI: 1.313–3.436; P = 0.002), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.680; 95% CI: 1.166–2.420; P = 0.005) were independently associated with poor outcome. The C-statistic of the outcome model was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81–0.94). Furthermore, the SAP model significantly improved discrimination and net benefit more than the A2DS2 scale, with a C-statistic of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.83). Conclusions After the addition of neuroimaging features, the models exhibit good differentiation and calibration for the prediction of the occurrence of SAP and the development of poor outcomes in HCI patients. The SAP model could better predict the SAP, representing a helpful and valid tool to obtain a net benefit compared with the A2DS2 scale.",Frontiers in Neurology,journal,3513ce18-3757-4358-b15f-7060af98e6d0,Frontiers in Neurology,,13,,2022,2022-02-04 00:00:00,"Yaoyao Yu, Tianyi Xia, Zhouli Tan, Huwei Xia, Shenping He, Han Sun, Xifan Wang, Haolan Song, Weijian Chen","2129418111, 1651654814, 2152252911, 2152252251, 2154572155, 2143527495, 2155087662, 2122643023, 1944459462",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30fd98944b72c8e5e86cd6dea2aa1aff7607a38b,Medicine,2129418111,['JournalArticle'],6.0,63.0

Purpose: To determine the microbiology and outcomes of SAP in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) for patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: In this observational study, included patients were divided into SAP and non-SAP based on a comprehensive analysis of symptom, imaging, and laboratory results. Baseline characteristics, clinical characteristics, microbiology, and outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: Of 200 patients, 42.5% developed SAP after the onset of stroke, and they had a lower proportion of non-smokers (p = 0.002), lower GCS score (p < 0.001), higher serum CRP (p < 0.001) at ICU admission, and a higher proportion of males (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.039) than patients with non-SAP. Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (78.8%), followed by Gram-positive aerobic cocci (29.4%). The main pathogens included K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Burkholderia cepacia. SAP prolonged length of MV (p < 0.001), duration of ICU stay (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p = 0.027), shortened MV-free days by 28 (p < 0.001), and caused elevated vasopressor application (p = 0.001) and 60-day mortality (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis suggested that patients with coma (p < 0.001) have a higher risk of developing SAP. Conclusion: The microbiology of SAP is similar to early phase of HAP and VAP. SAP prolongs the duration of MV and length of ICU and hospital stays, but also markedly increases 60-day mortality.",Frontiers in Microbiology,journal,25a655e4-17da-4bfc-a246-5cd20202068d,Frontiers in Microbiology,,12,,2021,2021-12-03 00:00:00,"Jie Zhao, Lei-qing Li, Ning Zhen, L.

To define hallmarks of severe COVID-19 in acute disease ( n  = 58) and in disease recovery in convalescent patients ( n  = 28) from Hannover Medical School, we used flow cytometry and proteomics data with unsupervised clustering analyses. In our observational study, we combined analyses of immune cells and cytokine/chemokine networks with endothelial activation and injury. ICU patients displayed an altered immune signature with prolonged lymphopenia but the expansion of granulocytes and plasmablasts along with activated and terminally differentiated T and NK cells and high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The core signature of seven plasma proteins revealed a highly inflammatory microenvironment in addition to endothelial injury in severe COVID-19. Changes within this signature were associated with either disease progression or recovery. In summary, our data suggest that besides a strong inflammatory response, severe COVID-19 is driven by endothelial activation and barrier disruption, whereby recovery depends on the regeneration of the endothelial integrity.",Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy,journal,660e7c97-71af-4d68-a87d-536a5ae0c644,Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy,,6,,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,"L.

Methods: We performed a longitudinal analysis of CSVD and clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with primary ICH who had MRI. Baseline CSVD load (including white matter hyperintensities [WMH], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces [EPVS]) was evaluated. The cumulative CSVD score was calculated by combining the presence of each CSVD marker (range 0–4). We followed participants for poor functional outcome [modified Rankin scale [mRS] ≥ 4], stroke recurrence, and time-varying survival during a median follow-up of 4.9 [interquartile range [IQR] 3.1–6.0] years. Parsimonious and fuller multivariable logistic regression analysis and Cox-regression analysis were performed to estimate the association of CSVD markers, individually and collectively, with each outcome. Results: A total of 153 patients were included in the analyses. CMBs ≥ 10 [adjusted OR [adOR] 3.252, 95% CI 1.181–8.956, p = 0.023] and periventricular WMH (PWMH) (adOR 2.053, 95% CI 1.220–3.456, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with poor functional outcome. PWMH (adOR 2.908, 95% CI 1.230–6.878, p = 0.015) and lobar CMB severity (adOR 1.811, 95% CI 1.039–3.157, p = 0.036) were associated with stroke recurrence. The cumulative CSVD score was associated with poor functional outcome (adOR 1.460, 95% CI 1.017–2.096) and stroke recurrence (adOR 2.258, 95% CI 1.080–4.723). Death occurred in 36.1% (13/36) of patients with CMBs ≥ 10 compared with 18.8% (22/117) in those with CMB < 10 (adjusted HR 2.669, 95% CI 1.248–5.707, p = 0.011). In addition, the cumulative CSVD score ≥ 2 was associated with a decreased survival rate (adjusted HR 3.140, 95% CI 1.066–9.250, p = 0.038).

We pose a series of questions about the nature of SVD‐related cognitive impairments and provide answers based on a comprehensive review and meta‐analysis of published data from 69 studies. Although SVD is thought primarily to affect executive function and processing speed, we hypothesize that SVD affects all major domains of cognitive ability. We also identify low levels of education as a potentially modifiable risk factor for SVD‐related cognitive impairment. Therefore, we propose the use of comprehensive cognitive assessments and the measurement of educational level both in clinics and research settings, and suggest several recommendations for future research.",Alzheimer's & Dementia,journal,c7d391f8-08f8-4dc2-8081-c3d96a19f620,Alzheimer's & Dementia,665 - 685,17,,2020,2020-11-13 00:00:00,"Olivia K.

Based on extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (xDLVO) theory, the major fouling mechanisms, i.e., Lifshitz–van der Waals (LW), electrostatic (EL), and acid–base (AB) interactions, were for the first time quantitatively analyzed for model HA–bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures at different solution conditions. Results indicated that the pH, ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration of the solution significantly affected the physicochemical properties and the interaction energy between the polyethersulfone (PES) membrane and HA–BSA mixtures. The free energy of cohesion of the HA–BSA mixtures was minimum at pH = 3.0, ionic strength = 100 mM, and c(Ca2+) = 1.0 mM. The AB interaction energy was a key contributor to the total interaction energy when the separation distance between the membrane surface and HA–BSA mixtures was less than 3 nm, while the influence of EL interaction energy was of less importance to the total interaction energy. The attractive interaction energies of membrane–foulant and foulant–foulant increased at low pH, high ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration, thus aggravating membrane fouling, which was supported by the fouling experimental results. The obtained findings would provide valuable insights for the quantitative understanding of membrane fouling mechanisms of mixed organics during MF.",Water,journal,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,,2018,2018-09-22 00:00:00,"Chunyi Sun, N.

0361d30d697336ccdb7da1c9fd739035d79daa7d,10.3390/W10070847,Membrane Fouling for Produced Water Treatment: A Review Study From a Process Control Perspective,"The offshore oil and gas industry is experiencing increasing water cuts as the reservoirs mature. The increase in produced water stresses the currently deployed deoiling technologies, resulting in more oil in the discharged water. Deploying membrane filtration to reduce the hydrocarbon concentration inherits additional complications related to fouling of the membranes: A process where the accumulation of material within and on the membrane surface adds additional flow resistance. This paper reviews and analyses the fouling detection, removal, prevention, dynamical and static modeling, with emphasis on how the membrane process can be manipulated from a process control perspective. The majority of the models rely on static descriptions or are limited to a narrow range of operating conditions which limits the usability of the models. This paper concludes that although the membrane filtration has been successfully applied and matured in many other industrial areas, challenges regarding cost-effective mitigation of fouling in the offshore deoiling applications, still exist. Fouling-based modeling combined with online parameter identification could potentially expand the operating range of the models and facilitate advanced control design to address transient performance and scheduling of fouling removal methods, resulting in cost-effective operation of membrane filtration systems. With the benefits of membrane filtration, it is predicted that membrane technology will be incorporated in produced water treatment, if the zero-discharge policies are enforced globally.",Water,journal,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,,2018,2018-06-26 00:00:00,"Kasper L.

However, the development of a flexible proximity sensor that can perform in a large range of object mobility remains a challenge. Here, a polymer-based sensor that utilizes a nanostructure composite as the sensing element has been presented for forthcoming usage in healthcare and automotive applications. Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)/Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) composites are capable of detecting presence of an external object in a wide range of distance. The proximity sensor exhibits an unprecedented detection distance of 120 mm with a resolution of 0.3%/mm. The architecture and manufacturing procedures of TPU/CNTs sensor are straightforward and performance of the proximity sensor shows robustness to reproducibility as well as excellent electrical and mechanical flexibility under different bending radii and over hundreds of bending cycles with variation of 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively. Tunneling and fringing effects are addressed as the sensing mechanism to explain significant capacitance changes. Percolation threshold analysis of different TPU/CNT contents indicated that nanocomposites having 2 wt% carbon nanotubes are exhibiting excellent sensing capabilities to achieve maximum detection accuracy and least noise among others. Fringing capacitance effect of the structure has been systematically analyzed by ANSYS Maxwell (Ansoft) simulation, as the experiments precisely supports the sensitivity trend in simulation. Our results introduce a new mainstream platform to realize an ultrasensitive perception of objects, presenting a promising prototype for application in wearable proximity sensors for motion analysis and artificial electronic skin.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,,2021,2021-01-13 00:00:00,"R.

The goal of this study is to create a forecasting workflow that increases prediction accuracy independent of the machine learning method and has minimal computational requirements. The proposed trend decomposition method incorporates irradiance and seasonal features as exogenous inputs. In order to extract the linear part of the data, a moving average filter is used. The nonlinear (stable) component of the time series is then calculated by subtracting this linear part from the original data. The stable portion is modeled using several machine learning methods, while the ordinary least squares method is applied to the linear series. By aggregating both results, the final forecast is obtained. The forecasting performances of the machine learning algorithms on unprocessed data are used as baselines for evaluations. Improvements up to 39% in the mean absolute error and up to 31% in the root mean square error metrics are observed compared to the baselines. Experimental results show that the proposed trend decomposition with extrapolation method increases the forecasting performance and generalization capacity of machine learning algorithms.",Energy Technology,journal,d757e504-289c-4242-967d-647bd71c352f,Energy Technology,,,,2023,2023-12-09 00:00:00,"Gurcan Kavakci, Begum Cicekdag, S.

The difficulty of creating a yield forecast system is in the correct choice of predictors that have the greatest impact on yield.
To build the model, moisture in the 100 cm layer of the soil, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, humus, and soil acidity in the soil were used as input parameters. The amount of precipitation over 4 months, the average air temperature for the same period, as well as the presence of diseases, pests, and weeds were also taken into consideration. Data on 13 districts of the North Kazakhstan region in the period from 2008 to 2017 were used. The output parameter was the yield of spring wheat over the same time period.
The relative importance of input variables in relation to the output variable was used to determine the weight values of input variables.
An artificial neural network of error backpropagation was used as a method. The advantage of this method is that the quality of the forecast increases with a large amount of training data, as well as the ability to model nonlinear relationships between different data sources.
After training the artificial neural network and obtaining predictive data, good results were achieved for predicting wheat yields (p=0.52, mean absolute error in percentage (MAPE)=12.02 %, root mean square error (RMSE)=3.368).
Thus, it is assumed that the developed model for forecasting wheat yields based on data can be easily adapted for other crops and places and will allow the adoption of the right strategies to ensure food security",Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,journal,405a8682-2b02-472d-9d89-0115f4e329bc,Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,,,,2022,2022-06-30 00:00:00,"Gailya Aubakirova, V.

Systems require high accuracy, low cost, and low computational complexity prediction methods. Although exponential smoothing is an effective method, there is a lack of use with cellular networks and research on data traffic. The accuracy and suitability of this method need to be evaluated using several types of traffic. Thus, this study introduces the application of exponential smoothing as a method of adaptive forecasting of cellular network traffic for cases of voice (in Erlang) and data (in megabytes or gigabytes). Simple and Error, Trend, Seasonal (ETS) methods are used for exponential smoothing. By investigating the effect of their smoothing factors in describing cellular network traffic, the accuracy of forecast using each method is evaluated. This research comprises a comprehensive analysis approach using multiple case study comparisons to determine the best fit model. Different exponential smoothing models are evaluated for various traffic types in different time scales. The experiments are implemented on real data from a commercial cellular network, which is divided into a training data part for modeling and test data part for forecasting comparison. This study found that ETS framework is not suitable for hourly voice traffic, but it provides nearly the same results with Holt–Winter’s multiplicative seasonal (HWMS) in both cases of daily voice and data traffic. HWMS is presumably encompassed by ETC framework and shows good results in all cases of traffic. Therefore, HWMS is recommended for cellular network traffic prediction due to its simplicity and high accuracy.  ",Journal of Information and Communication Technologies,journal,8647ec57-7e23-4bf6-8daf-83a8b917e700,Journal of Information and Communication Technology,,,,2018,2018-12-11 00:00:00,"Quang Thanh Tran, Li Hao, Q.

In this paper, we first introduce CF tasks and their main challenges, such as data sparsity, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, shilling attacks, privacy protection, etc., and their possible solutions. We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, modelbased, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges.

Several screening methods, including electroencephalography, have been proposed to identify epileptic episodes. EEG data, which are frequently utilised to enhance epilepsy analysis, offer essential information on the electrical processes of the brain. Prior to the emergence of deep learning (DL), feature extraction was accomplished by standard machine learning techniques. As a result, they were only as good as the people who made the features by hand. But with DL, both feature extraction and classification are fully automated. These methods have significantly advanced several fields of medicine, including the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, the works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using ML and DL techniques are presented as well as their comparative analysis is done. The UCI-Epileptic Seizure Recognition dataset is used for training and validation. Some of the conventional ML and DL algorithms are used with a proposed model which uses long short-term memory (LSTM) to find the best approach. Post that comparative analysis is performed on these algorithms to find the best approach for epileptic seizure detection. As a result, the proposed model LSTM gives a validation accuracy of 97% giving the most appropriate and precise result as compared to other mentioned algorithms used in this study.",Journal of engineering and applied sciences,journal,e256e3ac-b37b-449d-a0cc-9b5202105c92,Journal of Engineering and Applied Science,,,,2024,2024-01-19 00:00:00,"Pankaj Kunekar, Mukesh Kumar Gupta, Pramod Gaur","73674966, 2280763904, 2280594943",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a38f3d38bf9e1538343b615fb6429f38732ecbe2,"Computer Science, Medicine",73674966,['JournalArticle'],17.0,25.0

The proper diagnosis of epilepsy is crucial due to its distinctive nature and the subsequent negative effects of epileptic seizures on patients. The classification of minimally pre-processed, raw multichannel EEG signal recordings is the foundation of this article’s unique method for identifying seizures in pre-adult patients. The new method makes use of the automatic feature learning capabilities of a three-dimensional deep convolution auto-encoder (3D-DCAE) associated with a neural network-based classifier to build an integrated framework that endures training in a supervised manner to attain the highest level of classification precision among brain state signals, both ictal and interictal. A pair of models were created and evaluated for testing and assessing our method, utilizing three distinct EEG data section lengths, and a tenfold cross-validation procedure. Based on five evaluation criteria, the labelled hybrid convolutional auto-encoder (LHCAE) model, which utilizes a classifier based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and an EEG segment length of 4 s, had the best efficiency. This proposed model has 99.08 ± 0.54% accuracy, 99.21 ± 0.50% sensitivity, 99.11 ± 0.57% specificity, 99.09 ± 0.55% precision, and an F1-score of 99.16 ± 0.58%, according to the publicly available Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB) dataset. Based on the obtained outcomes, the proposed seizure classification model outperforms the other state-of-the-art method’s performance in the same dataset.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,,2023,2023-10-16 00:00:00,"S.

Early diagnosis of ASD can prevent from its severity and prolonged effects. Federated learning (FL) is one of the most recent techniques that can be applied for accurate ASD diagnoses in early stages or prevention of its long-term effects. In this article, FL technique has been uniquely applied for autism detection by training two different ML classifiers including logistic regression and support vector machine locally for classification of ASD factors and detection of ASD in children and adults. Due to FL, results obtained from these classifiers have been transmitted to central server where meta classifier is trained to determine which approach is most accurate in the detection of ASD in children and adults. Four different ASD patient datasets, each containing more than 600 records of effected children and adults have been obtained from different repository for features extraction. The proposed model predicted ASD with 98% accuracy (in children) and 81% accuracy (in adults).",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,,2023,2023-06-13 00:00:00,"M.

It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world's population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.",Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,journal,2ca1e2ac-8c3b-4251-94ed-24846d391d3b,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,,2022,,2022,2022-01-20 00:00:00,"Milind Natu, M.

Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,journal,2ca4279c-8ed7-4280-8022-09e577923a09,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,14,,2020,2020-05-13 00:00:00,"Dan Pan, An Zeng, L.

In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis has attached great significance to artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modalities of imaging data, T1-weighted MR and FDG-PET are widely used for this task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to integrate all the multi-modality information included in both T1-MR and FDG-PET images of the hippocampal area, for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, instead, it utilizes 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis or prognosis of AD. To test the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MR and FDG-PET images in the ADNI datasets, including 731 cognitively unimpaired (labeled as CN) subjects, 647 subjects with AD, 441 subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) and 326 subjects with progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI). We obtained higher accuracies of 90.10% for CN vs. AD task, 87.46% for CN vs. pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI vs. pMCI task. The proposed framework yields a state-of-the-art performance. Finally, the results have demonstrated that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite when using a CNN for the classification, (2) the combination of two modality imaging data generates better results.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,journal,2ca4279c-8ed7-4280-8022-09e577923a09,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,13,,2019,2019-02-26 00:00:00,"Yechong Huang, Jiahang Xu, Yuncheng Zhou, T.

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling chemistry at unprecedented computational speeds given accurate reference data. However, certain tasks, such as charge assignment, do not have a unique solution. Herein, we use a machine learning algorithm to discover a new charge assignment model by learning to replicate molecular dipole moments across a large, diverse set of nonequilibrium conformations of molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms. The new model, called Affordable Charge Assignment (ACA), is computationally inexpensive and predicts dipoles of out-of-sample molecules accurately. Furthermore, dipole-inferred ACA charges are transferable to dipole and even quadrupole moments of much larger molecules than those used for training. We apply ACA to dynamical trajectories of biomolecules and produce their infrared spectra. Additionally, we find that ACA assigns similar charges to Charge Model 5 but with greatly reduced computational cost.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,journal,45c7ef3c-e436-428b-a856-c8d5b31b603b,The journal of physical chemistry letters,"

However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations. Simultaneous accurate and efficient prediction of molecular properties relies on combined quantum mechanics and machine learning approaches.

However, its specific pathogenesis has not been clarified. This study aimed to identify biomarkers for OA diagnosis and elucidate their potential mechanisms for restoring OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis in vitro. Material and methods Two publicly available transcriptomic mRNA OA-related datasets (GSE10575 and GSE51588) were explored for biomarker identification by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). We applied the GSE32317 and GSE55457 cohorts to validate the markers’ efficacy for diagnosis. The connections of markers to chondrocyte autophagy and apoptosis in OA were also comprehensively explored in vitro using molecular biology approaches, including qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results We identified 286 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were enriched in the ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. After external cohort validation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, PDK1 was finally identified as a diagnostic marker for OA. The pharmacological properties of BX795-downregulated PDK1 expression inhibited LPS-induced chondrocyte inflammation and apoptosis and rescued OA-dysregulated autophagy. Additionally, the phosphorylation of the mediators associated with the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways was significantly downregulated, indicating the regulatory function of PDK1 in apoptosis and autophagy via MAPK and PI3K/AKT-associated signaling pathways in chondrocytes. A significantly positive association between the PDK1 expression and Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Plasma cells, and activated CD4 memory T cells, as well as an evident negative correlation between T cells follicular helper and CD4 naive T cells, were detected in the immune cell infiltration analysis. Conclusions PDK1 can be used as a diagnostic marker for OA.

Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interactions (PPI), and cytoHubba of Cytoscape were applied to identify hub genes. Clinical OA cartilage specimens were collected for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting (WB), histological staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and transfection. Sankey diagram was used to visualize the relationships between the expression level of SLC3A2 in the damaged area and clinical factors. Based on bioinformatics analysis, clinical factors, and experiment validation, SLC3A2 was identified as a hub gene. It was down-regulated in OA cartilage compared to normal cartilage (p < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that SLC3A2 was associated with ferroptosis-related functions. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression level of SLC3A2 in the OA cartilage-damaged area was closely related to BMI, obesity grade, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Furthermore, in vitro experiments validated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. In summary, we demonstrated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. These findings provide a new idea for the study of the pathogenesis of OA, thus providing new means for the clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy of OA.",Cells,journal,51278f27-cfdd-4938-81e4-9d54ca7b3cd0,Cells,,11,,2022,2022-10-30 00:00:00,"Hailong Liu, Zengfa Deng, Baoxi Yu, Hui Liu, Zhijian Yang, Anyu Zeng, M.

The incidence of OA is rising because of the ageing population and the epidemic of obesity. This research was designed for the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers for OA and analyzing the possible association between critical genes and infiltrated immune cells. 10 OA samples from patients with spinal OA and 10 normal samples were collected. GSE55235 and GSE55457 datasets including human OA and normal samples were downloaded from the GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between 20 OA and 20 controls. SVM-RFE analysis and LASSO regression model were carried out to screen possible markers. The compositional patterns of the 22 types of immune cell fraction in OA were determined by the use of CIBERSORT. The expression level of the biomarkers in OA was examined by the use of RT-PCR. In this study, an overall 44 DEGs were identified: 18 genes were remarkably upregulated and 26 genes were distinctly downregulated. KEGG pathway analyses revealed that pathways were significantly enriched including IL-17 signal path, rheumatoid arthritis, TNF signal path, and lipid and atherosclerosis. Based on the results of machine learning, we identified APOLD1 and EPYC as critical diagnostic genes in OA, which were further confirmed using ROC assays. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that APOLD1 was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Moreover, we found that EPYC was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Overall, our findings might provide some novel clue for the exploration of novel markers for OA diagnosis. The critical genes and their associations with immune infiltration may offer new insight into understanding OA developments.",Journal of Immunological Research,journal,8277b418-515d-4a95-b1cd-467da11bdad9,Journal of Immunology Research,,2022,,2022,2022-06-13 00:00:00,"Yihao Liang, F.

Therefore, it is of great significance to explore OA biomarkers for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of OA. Methods and materials The GSE129147, GSE57218, GSE51588, GSE117999, and GSE98918 datasets with normal and OA samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GSE117999 and GSE98918 datasets were integrated, and immune infiltration was evaluated. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the limma package in R, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore the co-expression genes and co-expression modules. The co-expression module genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, and hub genes were identified by the degree, MNC, closeness, and MCC algorithms. The hub genes were used to construct a diagnostic model based on support vector machines. Results The Immune Score in the OA samples was significantly higher than in the normal samples, and a total of 2313 DEGs were identified. Through WGCNA, we found that the yellow module was significantly positively correlated with the OA samples and Immune Score and negatively correlated with the normal samples. The 142 DEGs of the yellow module were related to biological processes such as regulation of inflammatory response, positive regulation of inflammatory response, blood vessel morphogenesis, endothelial cell migration, and humoral immune response. The intersections of the genes obtained by the 4 algorithms resulted in 5 final hub genes, and the diagnostic model constructed with these 5 genes showed good performance in the training and validation cohorts.

This study aimed to determine the mechanistic similarities and differences between OA and RA by integrated analysis of multiple gene expression data sets. Microarray data sets of OA and RA were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). By integrating multiple gene data sets, specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of DEGs were conducted to determine hub genes and pathways. The “Cell Type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT)” algorithm was employed to evaluate the immune infiltration cells (IICs) profiles in OA and RA. Moreover, mouse models of RA and OA were established, and selected hub genes were verified in synovial tissues with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A total of 1116 DEGs were identified between OA and RA. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were enriched in regulation of cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, positive regulation of neuron differentiation, nuclear speck, RNA polymerase II transcription factor complex, protein serine/threonine kinase activity and proximal promoter sequence-specific DNA binding. KEGG pathway analysis showed that DEGs were enriched in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, FoxO signaling pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway. Immune cell infiltration analysis identified 9 IICs with significantly different distributions between OA and RA samples. qPCR results showed that the expression levels of the hub genes (RPS6, RPS14, RPS25, RPL11, RPL27, SNRPE, EEF2 and RPL19) were significantly increased in OA samples compared to their counterparts in RA samples (P < 0.05).

The aims of this study were to analyze if synovial inflammation is already present in early OA and to characterize the involved cell populations, by investigating synovial fluid (SF) and synovial membrane (SM) of early OA patients for the presence and polarization status of CD4 T cells. Methods A quantitative analysis of CD4 + T cell infiltration in SF and SM compared to peripheral blood (PB) was performed in patients with early stages of OA. We further investigated intracellular staining (ICS), surface marker, and chemokine receptor expression profiles of CD4 + T cells in SF, SM, and PB, as well as cytokine expression in native SF and PB. Matched samples of SF, SM, and PB were harvested from 40 patients with early OA at the time of surgery. Early OA was confirmed by independent surgeons intraoperatively. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for surface markers and cytokines, which are preferentially expressed by distinct T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells). Furthermore, we analyzed native SF and PB supernatants using MACSPlex for multiple cytokine expression profiles. Results SF and SM showed a distinct infiltration of CD4 + T lymphocytes, with significantly increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3/CCR5, cytokine IFN-γ (preferentially expressed by Th1 cells), and CD161 (preferentially expressed by IL-17 producing Th17 cells) compared to PB. Furthermore, the percentage of CD4 + T cells polarized to Treg was significantly increased in SM compared to SF and PB. No significant differences were observed for CCR3 and CCR4 (preferentially expressed by Th2 cells), although IL-4 values were significantly higher in SM and SF compared to PB. Cytokine analysis showed comparable results between PB and SF, with only IL-6 being significantly increased in SF. Conclusions Early OA joints show already significant inflammation through CD4 + T cell infiltration, with predominant Th1 cell polarization. Inflammation seems to be driven by direct proinflammatory cell interaction. Cytokine signaling seems to be negligible at the site of inflammation in early OA, with only IL-6 being significantly increased in SF compared to PB.",Arthritis Research & Therapy,journal,72dca55a-55b5-4189-ab00-57c1bdb44a53,Arthritis Research & Therapy,,23,,2021,2021-01-22 00:00:00,"N.

The application of integrated omics to exploring robust signatures for clinical translation is increasingly highlighted, attributed to the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade in diverse malignancies. However, effective tools to comprehensively interpret multi-omics data is still warranted to provide increased granularity into intrinsic mechanism of oncogenesis and immunotherapeutic sensitivity. Results We developed a computational tool for effective Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR), providing comprehensive investigation of estimation of reported or user-built signatures, TME deconvolution and signature construction base on multi-omics data. Notably, IOBR offers batch analyses of these signatures and their correlations with clinical phenotypes, lncRNA profiling, genomic characteristics and signatures generated from single-cell RNA sequencing data in different cancer settings. Additionally, IOBR also integrates multiple existing microenvironmental deconvolution methodologies and signature construction tools for convenient comparison and selection.

We aimed to uncover the intrinsic expression profiles correlating with prognostic genetic abnormalities by WGCNA. Methods We downloaded the clinical and expression dataset from BeatAML, TCGA and GEO database. Using R (version 4.0.2) and ‘WGCNA’ package, the co-expression modules correlating with the ELN2017 prognostic markers were identified (R 2  ≥ 0.4, p < 0.01). ORA detected the enriched pathways for the key co-expression modules. The patients in TCGA cohort were randomly assigned into the training set (50%) and testing set (50%). The LASSO penalized regression analysis was employed to build the prediction model, fitting OS to the expression level of hub genes by ‘glmnet’ package. Then the testing and 2 independent validation sets (GSE12417 and GSE37642) were used to validate the diagnostic utility and accuracy of the model. Results A total of 37 gene co-expression modules and 973 hub genes were identified for the BeatAML cohort. We found that 3 modules were significantly correlated with genetic markers (the ‘lightyellow’ module for NPM1 mutation, the ‘saddlebrown’ module for RUNX1 mutation, the ‘lightgreen’ module for TP53 mutation). ORA revealed that the ‘lightyellow’ module was mainly enriched in DNA-binding transcription factor activity and activation of HOX genes. The ‘saddlebrown’ module was enriched in immune response process. And the ‘lightgreen’ module was predominantly enriched in mitosis cell cycle process. The LASSO- regression analysis identified 6 genes (NFKB2, NEK9, HOXA7, APRC5L, FAM30A and LOC105371592) with non-zero coefficients. The risk score generated from the 6-gene model, was associated with ELN2017 risk stratification, relapsed disease, and prior MDS history. The 5-year AUC for the model was 0.822 and 0.824 in the training and testing sets, respectively. Moreover, the diagnostic utility of the model was robust when it was employed in 2 validation sets (5-year AUC 0.743–0.79). Conclusions We established the co-expression network signature correlated with the ELN2017 recommended prognostic genetic abnormalities in AML.

Multiple cell types were identified based on profiling of 10,640 synoviocytes and 26,192 chondrocytes: 12 distinct synovial cell types and 7 distinct articular chondrocyte phenotypes from matched tissues. Intact cartilage was enriched for homeostatic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, while damaged cartilage was enriched for prefibro- and fibro-, regulatory, reparative and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. A total of 61 cytokines and growth factors were predicted to regulate the 7 chondrocyte cell phenotypes. Based on production by > 1% of cells, 55% of the cytokines were produced by synovial cells (39% exclusive to synoviocytes and not expressed by chondrocytes) and their presence in osteoarthritic synovial fluid confirmed. The synoviocytes producing IL-1beta (a classic pathogenic cytokine in osteoarthritis), mainly inflammatory macrophages and dendritic cells, were characterized by co-expression of surface proteins corresponding to HLA-DQA1 , HLA-DQA2 , OLR1 or TLR2 .

The use of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) in concrete is an effective way to minimize environmental pollution. RCA does not gain more attraction because of the availability of adhered mortar on its surface, which poses a harmful effect on the properties of concrete. However, a suitable mix design for RCA enables it to reach the targeted strength and be applicable for a wide range of construction projects. The targeted strength achievement from the proposed mix design at a laboratory is also a time-consuming task, which may cause a delay in the construction work. To overcome this flaw, the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, gene expression programming (GEP), and artificial neural network (ANN) was employed in this study to predict the compressive strength of RCA-based concrete. The linear coefficient correlation (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were evaluated to investigate the performance of the models. The k-fold cross-validation method was also adopted for the confirmation of the model’s performance. In comparison, the GEP model was more effective in terms of prediction by giving a higher correlation (R2) value of 0.95 as compared to ANN, which gave a value of R2 equal to 0.92. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to know about the contribution level of each parameter used to run the models. Moreover, the increment in data points and the use of other supervised ML approaches like boosting, gradient boosting, and bagging to forecast the compressive strength, would give a better response.",Buildings,journal,f2c78b1b-6bcc-4700-859b-af9401c02941,Buildings,,,,2021,2021-07-27 00:00:00,"Ayaz Ahmad, K.

The main purpose of this study is to develop a machine learning method for effective and efficient discovery and development of HPFRCC. Specifically, this research develops machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of HPFRCC through innovative incorporation of micromechanics, aiming to increase the prediction accuracy and generalization performance by enriching and improving the datasets through data cleaning, principal component analysis (PCA), and K-fold cross-validation. This study considers a total of 14 different mix design variables and predicts the ductility of HPFRCC for the first time, in addition to the compressive and tensile strengths. Different types of machine learning methods are investigated and compared, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), classification and regression tree (CART), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost). The results show that the developed machine learning models can reasonably predict the concerned mechanical properties and can be applied to perform parametric studies for the effects of different mix design variables on the mechanical properties. This study is expected to greatly promote efficient discovery and development of HPFRCC.",Materials,journal,0b8373ea-5505-4c96-99ff-b8da87a2ce3e,Materials,,14,,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,"P.

However, the conventional fitting algorithms are not suitable for accurate estimation of wetting properties, especially on hydrophilic surfaces, due to optical distortions triggered by changes in the focal length of the moving drops. Therefore, here we present an original setup coupled with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for estimation of Contact Angle (CA). The developed algorithm is trained on 3375 ground truth images (at different front-lit illuminations), less sensitive to the edges of the drops, and retains its stability for images that are synthetically blurred with higher Gaussian Blurring (GB) values (GB: 0–22) if compared to existing goniometers (GB: 0–12). Besides, the proposed technique can precisely analyze drops of various colors and chemistries on different surfaces. Finally, our automated orthogonal camera goniometer has a significantly lower average standard deviation (6.7° vs. 14.6°) and coefficient of variation (14.9 vs. 29.2%) than the existing techniques and enables wettability assessment of non-spherical drops on heterogeneous surfaces.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,,2023,2023-01-27 00:00:00,"Hossein Kabir, Nakul Garg","2202754992, 26945165",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16a20fd181dc2701add002cf05682df8b1bc304c,"Computer Science, Engineering, Materials Science, Medicine",2202754992,['JournalArticle'],103.0,76.0

Therefore, choosing a reasonable set of parameters for accurate advance rate prediction is paramount to reduce cutter wear and improve tunneling efficiency. However, since the geological parameters in mixed ground conditions are diverse and uncertain, the prediction of the advance rate (AR) of EPB shield tunneling is significantly more difficult than that in homogeneous ground (i.e., full-face hard-rock ground). In addition, the operating parameters of the EPB shield tunneling can be subjective and suboptimal, and each of them has some intricate influence on AR. In this paper, an optimized back-propagation neural network by genetic algorithm (BPNN-GA) was proposed for reasonable operating parameter selection and accurate AR prediction, and four typical machine learning methods were used for comparison. Five processing strategies with different input parameters were also proposed and compared to determine the optimum selection of geological parameters in mixed ground conditions. The proposed models with strategies were adopted in the case study of the Nanjing Metro Line S6 project, and a total of 1188 rings of datasets were used for this study. The results showed that the proposed modified BPNN with the genetic algorithm could be effectively implemented for the AR prediction. It concluded that Strategy B—i.e., using the composite ratio and the geological parameters of each layer as input—was the best strategy in mixed ground conditions for advance rate prediction. Hence, a high correlation between measured and predicted AR was observed in this study with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.920.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2022,2022-05-28 00:00:00,"Xuesong Fu, Q.

Kernel principal component analysis combined with logistic regression test (KPCA-LRT) has been successfully used in classifying gene expression data. Nevertheless, the purpose of association study is to detect the correlation between genetic variations and disease rather than to classify the sample, and the genomic data is categorical rather than numerical. Recently, although the kernel-based logistic regression model in association study has been proposed by projecting the nonlinear original SNPs data into a linear feature space, it is still impacted by multicolinearity between the projections, which may lead to loss of power. We, therefore, proposed a KPCA-LRT model to avoid the multicolinearity.ResultsSimulation results showed that KPCA-LRT was always more powerful than principal component analysis combined with logistic regression test (PCA-LRT) at different sample sizes, different significant levels and different relative risks, especially at the genewide level (1E-5) and lower relative risks (RR = 1.2, 1.3). Application to the four gene regions of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) data from Genetic Analysis Workshop16 (GAW16) indicated that KPCA-LRT had better performance than single-locus test and PCA-LRT.ConclusionsKPCA-LRT is a valid and powerful gene- or region-based method for the analysis of GWAS data set, especially under lower relative risks and lower significant levels.",BMC Genetics,journal,cc8cdfd1-81f1-4a3f-abf0-72d6a3f2859a,BMC Genetics,75 - 75,12,,2011,2011-08-26 00:00:00,"Qingsong Gao, Yungang He, Zhongshang Yuan, Jinghua Zhao, Bingbing Zhang, F.

This paper summarizes experimental design, pre-test sensor verification, and data collection from 10 reinforced concrete slabs subjected to field explosions using a modest budget. The experimental record contains pressure, displacement, and acceleration measurements of each slab except in a few cases where the sensors have failed.

The majority of these are in non-coding regions, and are commonly assigned to the nearest gene along the genome. However, this approach neglects the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and the fact that the genome contains arrays of extremely conserved non-coding elements termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which can be utilized to detect genes under long-range developmental regulation. Here we review a GRB-based approach to assign loci in non-coding regions to potential target genes, and apply it to reanalyse the results of one of the largest schizophrenia GWAS (SWG PGC, 2014). We further apply this approach to GWAS data from two related neuropsychiatric disorders—autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder—to show that it is applicable to developmental disorders in general. We find that disease-associated SNPs are overrepresented in GRBs and that the GRB model is a powerful tool for linking these SNPs to their correct target genes under long-range regulation. Our analysis identifies novel genes not previously implicated in schizophrenia and corroborates a number of predicted targets from the original study. The results are available as an online resource in which the genomic context and the strength of enhancer–promoter associations can be browsed for each schizophrenia-associated SNP.",Molecular Psychiatry,journal,3ef1d4dd-9ec8-4e05-9172-dfc4dedac8ef,Molecular Psychiatry,6 - 18,25,,2019,2019-10-15 00:00:00,"Ana Barešić, Alexander J.

We used extensive, empirically-driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests, and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency <10% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with ≥80% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies >25%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called “Winner’s Curse”, was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) which led to more accurate effect size estimation. These insights provide a foundation for future eQTL studies, especially those with sampling constraints and subtly different conditions.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,Nucleic Acids Research,e133 - e133,46,,2017,2017-10-25 00:00:00,"Q.

However, the sources of most regulatory genetic variation remain unknown. Here, we used transcriptome profiling in 1,012 yeast segregants to map the genetic basis of variation in gene expression with high statistical power. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that together account for over 70% of the total genetic contribution to variation in mRNA levels, allowing us to examine the sources of regulatory variation comprehensively. We found that variation in the expression of a typical gene has a complex genetic architecture involving multiple eQTL. We also detected hundreds of eQTL pairs with significant non-additive interactions in an unbiased genome-wide scan. Although most genes were influenced by a local eQTL located close to the gene, most expression variation arose from distant, trans-acting eQTL located far from their target genes. Nearly all distant eQTL clustered at 102 “hotspot” locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes and altered expression of their target genes though both direct and indirect mechanisms. Many local eQTL had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in trans. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,eLife,,7,,2017,2017-10-24 00:00:00,"F.

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects.

Most studies use single marker linear regression to discover primary signals, followed by sequential conditional modeling to detect secondary genetic variants affecting gene expression. However, this approach assumes that functional variants are sparsely distributed and that close linkage between them has little impact on estimation of their precise location and the magnitude of effects. We describe a series of simulation studies designed to evaluate the impact of linkage disequilibrium (LD) on the fine mapping of causal variants with typical eQTL effect sizes. In the presence of multisite regulation, even though between 80 and 90% of modeled eSNPs associate with normally distributed traits, up to 10% of all secondary signals could be statistical artifacts, and at least 5% but up to one-quarter of credible intervals of SNPs within r2 > 0.8 of the peak may not even include a causal site. The Bayesian methods eCAVIAR and DAP (Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors) provide only modest improvement in resolution. Given the strong empirical evidence that gene expression is commonly regulated by more than one variant, we conclude that the fine mapping of causal variants needs to be adjusted for multisite influences, as conditional estimates can be highly biased by interference among linked sites, but ultimately experimental verification of individual effects is needed. Presumably similar conclusions apply not just to eQTL mapping, but to multisite influences on fine mapping of most types of quantitative trait.","G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics",journal,fa24e304-ead1-4f50-9fa8-8049a0a3bb19,G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics,2533 - 2544,7,,2016,2016-10-29 00:00:00,"B.

There is, however, still a dearth of study about whether graduate students acquire the employability skills that businesses want of them because of their higher education. To determine a student's future employment and career path, it is critical to evaluate their soft skills. An emerging area called educational data mining (EDM) aims to gather enormous volumes of academic data produced and maintained by educational institutions and to derive explicit and specific information from it. This paper aims to predict students' soft skills such as professional, analytical, linguistic, communication, and ethical skills, based on their socio-economic, academic, and institutional data by leveraging data mining methods and machine learning techniques. All five soft skills were predicted using prediction models created using linear regression, probabilistic neural networks, and simple regression tree techniques. This study used a dataset from an open source that Universidad Technologica de Bolivar published. It covers academic, social, and economic data for 12,411 students. The experimental results demonstrated that the linear regression algorithm performed better than the others in predicting all five soft skills compared to machine learning methods. This finding can assist higher education institutions in making informed decisions, providing tailored support, enhancing student success and employability, and continuously modifying their programs to meet the needs of students.",JOIV: International Journal on Informatics Visualization,journal,0fa5fb50-57a4-4633-aa8f-91804e20ac17,JOIV : International Journal on Informatics Visualization,,,,2023,2023-11-30 00:00:00,"Rathimala Kannan, Chew Chin Jet, Kannan Ramakrishnan, Sujatha Ramdass","2066417170, 2276693112, 26945108, 2276696902",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e43ff4d7efb4a5216f20ed5acb57929a97c759ae,"Computer Science, Economics, Education",2066417170,['JournalArticle'],2.0,0.0

The present study investigated important predictors in determining the satisfaction of undergraduate students (N = 425) from multiple departments in using ERL at a self-funded university in Hong Kong while Moodle and Microsoft Team are the key learning tools. By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores. The results suggest that the need of reviewing the quality and quantity of modified assessment accommodated for ERL and structured class delivery with the suitable amount of interactive learning according to the learning culture and program nature.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,16,,2021,2021-04-02 00:00:00,"I.

It is particularly difficult for governments in low-income countries, where informal industry is responsible for a large amount of pollution, because the governments lack the ability to locate and monitor large numbers of dispersed polluters. This study demonstrates an accurate, scalable machine-learning approach for identifying brick kilns, a highly polluting informal industry in Bangladesh, in satellite imagery. Our data reveal widespread violations of the national regulations governing brick manufacturing, which has implications for the health and well-being of the country. Our approach offers a low-cost, replicable method for regulatory agencies to generate information on key pollution sources. Improving compliance with environmental regulations is critical for promoting clean environments and healthy populations. In South Asia, brick manufacturing is a major source of pollution but is dominated by small-scale, informal producers who are difficult to monitor and regulate—a common challenge in low-income settings. We demonstrate a low-cost, scalable approach for locating brick kilns in high-resolution satellite imagery from Bangladesh. Our approach identifies kilns with 94.2% accuracy and 88.7% precision and extracts the precise GPS coordinates of every brick kiln across Bangladesh. Using these estimates, we show that at least 12% of the population of Bangladesh (>18 million people) live within 1 km of a kiln and that 77% and 9% of kilns are (illegally) within 1 km of schools and health facilities, respectively. Finally, we show how kilns contribute up to 20.4 μg/m3 of PM2.5 (particulate matter of a diameter less than 2.5 μm) in Dhaka when the wind blows from an unfavorable direction. We document inaccuracies and potential bias with respect to local regulations in the government data. Our approach demonstrates how machine learning and Earth observation can be combined to better understand the extent and implications of regulatory compliance in informal industry.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,journal,bb95bf2e-8383-4748-bf9d-d6906d091085,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,118,,2021,2021-04-22 00:00:00,"Jihyeon Lee, Nina Brooks, Fahim Tajwar, M.

Until recently, its extent was poorly understood and no tools existed for systematically detecting forced labor risk on individual fishing vessels on a global scale. Here we use satellite data and machine learning to identify these high-risk vessels and find widespread risk of forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet. This information provides new opportunities for unique market, enforcement, and policy interventions. This also provides a proof of concept for how remotely sensed dynamic individual behavior can be used to infer forced labor abuses. While forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet has been widely documented, its extent remains unknown. No methods previously existed for remotely identifying individual fishing vessels potentially engaged in these abuses on a global scale. By combining expertise from human rights practitioners and satellite vessel monitoring data, we show that vessels reported to use forced labor behave in systematically different ways from other vessels. We exploit this insight by using machine learning to identify high-risk vessels from among 16,000 industrial longliner, squid jigger, and trawler fishing vessels. Our model reveals that between 14% and 26% of vessels were high-risk, and also reveals patterns of where these vessels fished and which ports they visited. Between 57,000 and 100,000 individuals worked on these vessels, many of whom may have been forced labor victims. This information provides unprecedented opportunities for novel interventions to combat this humanitarian tragedy. More broadly, this research demonstrates a proof of concept for using remote sensing to detect forced labor abuses.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,journal,bb95bf2e-8383-4748-bf9d-d6906d091085,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,118,,2020,2020-12-21 00:00:00,"Gavin G.

Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activities in rural and remote locations may provide heightened opportunities to conceal the alleged human rights violations associated with mining, such as: hazardous working conditions, health impacts, child labour, child trafficking, and debt bondage. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method, teamed with high temporal frequency Sentinel-1 imagery, for monitoring ASM activity in rural locations of the “Copperbelt”, the DRC. The results show that the ISBAS descriptive variables (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) were significantly different (p-value = ≤ 0.05) between mining and non-mining areas. Additionally, a significant difference was found for the ISBAS descriptive variables mean, standard deviation, and minimum between the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnels). As expected, a high level of subsidence (i.e., negative ISBAS pixel value) was a clear indicator of mine activity. Trial activity thresholds were set for the descriptive variables mean (-2.43 mm/yr) and minimum (-5.36 mm/yr) to explore an ISBAS approach to active mine identification. The study concluded that the ISBAS method has great potential as a monitoring tool for ASM, with the ability to separate mining and non-mining areas based on surface motion values, and further distinguish the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnel). Ground data collection and further development of ISBAS analysis needs to be made to fully understand the value of an ISBAS-based ASM monitoring system. In particular, surrounding the impact of seasonality relative to longer-term trends in ASM activity.",Sustainability,journal,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,,2020,2020-11-24 00:00:00,"Chloe Brown, A.

Using remote sensing methods, the location and impacts of fish-processing activities were assessed within a case study of Bangladesh’s Sundarbans mangrove forests. Ten fish-processing camps were identified, with some occurring in locations where human activity is banned. Environmental degradation included the removal of mangroves, erosion, and the destruction of protected areas. Previous studies have identified cases of labour exploitation and modern slavery occurring within the Sundarbans, and remote sensing was used to triangulate these claims by providing spatial and temporal analysis to increase the understanding of the operational trends at these locations. These findings were linked to the cyclical relationship between modern slavery and environmental degradation, whereby environmental damage is both a driver and result of workers subjected to modern slavery. Remote sensing can be used as an additional methodological tool to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and provide evidence to support the promotion of the “freedom dividend” which would have far-reaching economic, social, cultural, and environmental benefits. Satellite remote sensing is likely to play an important role going forward for understanding these issues but should be augmented with ground-based data collection methods.",Maritime Studies,journal,09a698ca-2c36-4d1f-8331-116ded8a883a,Maritime Studies,429 - 444,19,,2020,2020-09-17 00:00:00,"B.

The present study focuses on the identification, characterization, and quantification techniques for tracking microplastics. Due to their unique compositional structure, unambiguous identification of individual polymers in various plastic samples, usually comprised of mixtures of individual polymers, remains a challenge. Therefore, there is limited research on the pyrolysis characterization of mixed samples. In this study, two analytical methods, TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS combined with thermogravimetric analysis were used to evaluate the thermal-degradation process of individual and mixed samples of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The primary interaction was the volatilization of terephthalic acid bound to chlorine molecules. The reduction of vinyl-ester functional groups and aromatic hydrocarbon intermediates related to olefin branching was confirmed. Char formation was increased, due to aromatic compounds from PET and PVC. All of the polymers used in the study may be underestimated in quantity, due to combined volatilizations during pyrolysis. TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS showed forceful advantages in identifying mixed microplastics through different discrimination mechanisms. The study provides deep insight into pyrolysis behaviors and the interactions of mixed polymers, and the obtained results can help better comprehend the complex pyrolysis process.",Polymers,journal,4efb9ad7-9740-4922-b9c8-c29376ca2223,Polymers,,15,,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,"M.

The train and test datasets were obtained from jar test experimentation on the petroleum industry effluent (PIE) sample using aluminum sulfate (AS) as the coagulant. The ML algorithm from scikit-learn was employed to determine the optimum operating condition for the removal of colloidal particles, causing turbidity in the PIE. The predictive capacity of four ML models was compared based on their statistical metrics for clean discharge. The predicted optimum condition corresponds to pH (10), dosage (0.1 g/L), and settling time (30 min) which transcends to residual turbidity ≤ 10 NTU and translates to 95% removal efficiency. The second-order AS-sweep flocculation kinetic showed that at the predicted optimum conditions, modeled rate constant of 1.33 × 10−3 L/g.min and flocculation period of 1.2 min reduced the combination of the monomer, dimmer, and trimmer class colloids from an initial 570 mg/L concentration to the residual counts of 24 mg/L corresponding to residual turbidity ≤ 10 NTU under the mixing regime 14 s−1 ≤ G ≤ 164 s−1 satisfied the EPA standard for clean effluent discharge. It incorporated the selected ML output with time-evolution and aggregation kinetics to define sedimentation tank geometry for cleaner discharge. The findings from the design-driven optimization recommended a flow rate (1000 m3s−1), coefficient of kinematic viscosity (0.841 mm/s), and the required detention time (30–60 min) to define the sedimentation tank geometry.

Considering the large volume of common Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, this paper presents a strategy to accurately identify the ionospheric amplitude scintillation events utilizing the measurements collected with geodetic GNSS receivers. The proposed detection method relies on a pre-trained machine learning decision tree algorithm, leveraging the scintillation index computed from the carrier-to-noise data and elevation angles collected at 1-Hz. The experimental results using real data demonstrate a 99% accuracy in scintillation detection can be achieved. By combining advanced machine learning techniques with geodetic GNSS receivers, this approach is feasible to effectively detect ionospheric scintillation using non-scintillation GNSS receivers.

As a result, electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity as they are independent of oil and do not produce greenhouse gases. However, despite their benefits, several operational issues still need to be addressed for EV adoption to become widespread. This research delves into the evolution of EVs over time and highlights their benefits, including reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. It also explores the challenges and difficulties faced in their adoption, such as the high cost of infrastructure, scarcity of charging stations, limited range or range anxiety, and the performance of batteries. To overcome these challenges, potential solutions include enhancing the charging infrastructure, increasing the number of charging stations, using battery swapping techniques, and improving battery technology to address range anxiety and reduce charging times. Governments can incentivize consumers to purchase EVs through tax credits or subsidies and invest in building a robust charging infrastructure. Industry stakeholders can collaborate with governments to address these challenges and promote the adoption of EVs, which can contribute to reducing carbon emissions and air pollution.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2023,2023-05-13 00:00:00,Fayez Alanazi,119669844,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0b5c8dbc1f3e76f73ad77277bddafb44da4b8e1,"Economics, Engineering, Environmental Science",119669844,['JournalArticle'],274.0,91.0

In the recent era of COVID-19 pandemic, this nonhuman, machine-based technology has gained a lot of momentum. The supercomputers and robotics with AI technology have shown the potential to equal or even surpass human experts’ accuracy in some tasks in the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) is prompting massive data interweaving with elements from many digital sources such as medical imaging sorting, electronic health records, and transforming healthcare delivery. But in thoracic surgical and our counterpart pulmonary medical field, AI’s main applications are still for interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung histopathological slide evaluation, physiological data interpretation, and biosignal testing only. The query arises whether AI-enabled technology-based or autonomous robots could ever do or provide better thoracic surgical procedures than current surgeons but it seems like an impossibility now. This review article aims to provide information pertinent to the use of AI to thoracic surgical specialists. In this review article, we described AI and related terminologies, current utilisation, challenges, potential, and current need for awareness of this technology.",The Cardiothoracic Surgeon,journal,d4e5cd30-f5a1-462f-8982-9bcb33be6900,The Cardiothoracic Surgeon,,29,,2021,2021-07-03 00:00:00,"Anshuman Darbari, K.

It associates many risk factors in heart disease and a need of the time to get accurate, reliable, and sensible approaches to make an early diagnosis to achieve prompt management of the disease. Data mining is a commonly used technique for processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. Researchers apply several data mining and machine learning techniques to analyse huge complex medical data, helping healthcare professionals to predict heart disease. This research paper presents various attributes related to heart disease, and the model on basis of supervised learning algorithms as Naïve Bayes, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest algorithm. It uses the existing dataset from the Cleveland database of UCI repository of heart disease patients. The dataset comprises 303 instances and 76 attributes. Of these 76 attributes, only 14 attributes are considered for testing, important to substantiate the performance of different algorithms. This research paper aims to envision the probability of developing heart disease in the patients.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a signal that measures the electric activity of the heart. The proposed approach is implemented using ML-libs and Scala language on Apache Spark framework; MLlib is Apache Spark’s scalable machine learning library. The key challenge in ECG classification is to handle the irregularities in the ECG signals which is very important to detect the patient status. Therefore, we have proposed an efficient approach to classify ECG signals with high accuracy Each heartbeat is a combination of action impulse waveforms produced by different specialized cardiac heart tissues. Heartbeats classification faces some difficulties because these waveforms differ from person to another, they are described by some features. These features are the inputs of machine learning algorithm. In general, using Spark–Scala tools simplifies the usage of many algorithms such as machine-learning (ML) algorithms. On other hand, Spark–Scala is preferred to be used more than other tools when size of processing data is too large. In our case, we have used a dataset with 205,146 records to evaluate the performance of our approach. Machine learning libraries in Spark–Scala provide easy ways to implement many classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forests, Gradient-Boosted Trees (GDB), etc.). The proposed method is evaluated and validated on baseline MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia database. The results show that our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 96.75% using GDB Tree algorithm and 97.98% using random Forest for binary classification. For multi class classification, it achieved to 98.03% accuracy using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting tree supports only binary classification.",Journal of Big Data,journal,d60da343-ab92-4310-b3d7-2c0860287a9d,Journal of Big Data,,6,,2019,2019-08-31 00:00:00,"Fajr Ibrahem Alarsan, Mamoon Younes","1381648299, 1383260029",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5fbcbb07cc300f7e08bfdd1c1620d0ed05906576,"Computer Science, Medicine",1381648299,['JournalArticle'],163.0,21.0

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of AD. Therefore, patients with MCI who are at high risk of fully developing AD should be identified to accurately predict AD. However, the relationship between brain images and AD is difficult to construct because of the complex characteristics of neuroimaging data. To address this problem, we present a longitudinal measurement of MCI brain images and a hierarchical classification method for AD prediction. Longitudinal images obtained from individuals with MCI were investigated to acquire important information on the longitudinal changes, which can be used to classify MCI subjects as either MCI conversion (MCIc) or MCI non-conversion (MCInc) individuals. Moreover, a hierarchical framework was introduced to the classifier to manage high feature dimensionality issues and incorporate spatial information for improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated using 131 patients with MCI (70 MCIc and 61 MCInc) based on MRI scans taken at different time points. Results showed that the proposed method achieved 79.4% accuracy for the classification of MCIc versus MCInc, thereby demonstrating very promising performance for AD prediction.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,7,,2017,2017-01-12 00:00:00,"Meiyan Huang, Wei Yang, Qianjin Feng, Wufan Chen, M.

However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions. Method: First, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of AD subjects. Coefficients of MIE with values higher than 0.98 quantile were highlighted to obtain the discriminant regions that distinguish AD from NC. Results: The experiments showed that the proposed method can predict AD subjects with a competitive performance with existing methods, especially the accuracy of the polynomial kernel (92.36 ± 0.94) was better than the linear kernel of 91.47 ± 1.02 and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of 86.71 ± 1.93. The proposed eigenbrain-based CAD system detected 30 AD-related brain regions (Anterior Cingulate, Caudate Nucleus, Cerebellum, Cingulate Gyrus, Claustrum, Inferior Frontal Gyrus, Inferior Parietal Lobule, Insula, Lateral Ventricle, Lentiform Nucleus, Lingual Gyrus, Medial Frontal Gyrus, Middle Frontal Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Paracentral Lobule, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Postcentral Gyrus, Posterial Cingulate, Precentral Gyrus, Precuneus, Subcallosal Gyrus, Sub-Gyral, Superior Frontal Gyrus, Superior Parietal Lobule, Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, Thalamus, Transverse Temporal Gyrus, and Uncus).

The above problems mean that the manufacturing industry knowledge utilization rate is low. This paper proposes a novel Chinese fine-grained NER (named entity recognition) method based on symmetry lightweight deep multinetwork collaboration (ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF) and model transfer considering active learning (MTAL) to research fine-grained named entity recognition of a few labeled Chinese textual data types. The method is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF was applied for verification in the CLUENER2020 dataset (Public dataset) to get a pretrained model; the experiments show that the model obtains an F1 score of 0.8962, which is better than the best baseline algorithm, an improvement of 9.2%. In the second stage, the pretrained model was transferred into the Manufacturing-NER dataset (our dataset), and we used the active learning strategy to optimize the model effect. The final F1 result of Manufacturing-NER was 0.8931 after the model transfer (it was higher than 0.8576 before the model transfer); so, this method represents an improvement of 3.55%. Our method effectively transfers the existing knowledge from public source data to scientific target data, solving the problem of named entity recognition with scarce labeled domain data, and proves its effectiveness.",Symmetry,journal,1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,1986,12,,2020,2020-11-30 00:00:00,"Liguo Yao, Haisong Huang, Kuan-Wei Wang, Shih-Huan Chen, Qiaoqiao Xiong","113765846, 2899585, 3723159, 153064823, 2041658772",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53d1c4cce25c5d9f74b0c1c8a32341e69752ebfe,"Computer Science, Engineering",113765846,['JournalArticle'],20.0,48.0

The recognition of named entities based on Chinese is more complicated and difficult than English, which makes the task of NER in Chinese more challenging. In particular, fine-grained named entity recognition is more challenging than traditional named entity recognition tasks, mainly because fine-grained tasks have higher requirements for the ability of automatic feature extraction and information representation of deep neural models. In this paper, we propose an innovative neural network model named En2BiLSTM-CRF to improve the effect of fine-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks. This proposed model including the initial encoding layer, the enhanced encoding layer, and the decoding layer combines the advantages of pre-training model encoding, dual bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and a residual connection mechanism. Hence, it can encode information multiple times and extract contextual features hierarchically. We conducted sufficient experiments on two representative datasets using multiple important metrics and compared them with other advanced baselines. We present promising results showing that our proposed En2BiLSTM-CRF has better performance as well as better generalization ability in both fine-grained and coarse-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2020,2020-06-15 00:00:00,"Jingang Liu, Chunhe Xia, Haihua Yan, Wenjing Xu","49721680, 2056988799, 48506966, 2152921552",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9e45d4a6b3de0186e2cb430ecf01dcf17697342,Computer Science,49721680,,8.0,45.0

Named entity recognition is a natural language processing task carried out to obtain morpheme sequences with specific meanings, such as person, location, and organization names. Although morphological analysis and named entity recognition are closely associated with each other, they have been independently studied and have exhibited the inevitable error propagation problem. Hence, we propose an integrated model based on label attention networks that simultaneously performs morphological analysis and named entity recognition. The proposed model comprises two layers of neural network models that are closely associated with each other. The lower layer performs a morphological analysis, whereas the upper layer performs a named entity recognition. In our experiments using a public gold-labeled dataset, the proposed model outperformed previous state-of-the-art models used for morphological analysis and named entity recognition. Furthermore, the results indicated that the integrated architecture could alleviate the error propagation problem.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2020,2020-05-28 00:00:00,"Hongjin Kim, H.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has shown promising performance in tackling feature selection problems, but still faces challenges in dealing with large-scale feature selection in Big Data environment because of the large search space. Hence, this article proposes a bi-directional feature fixation (BDFF) framework for PSO and provides a novel idea to reduce the search space in large-scale feature selection. BDFF uses two opposite search directions to guide particles to adequately search for feature subsets with different sizes. Based on the two different search directions, BDFF can fix the selection states of some features and then focus on the others when updating particles, thus narrowing the large search space. Besides, a self-adaptive strategy is designed to help the swarm concentrate on a more promising direction for search in different stages of evolution and achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on 12 widely-used public datasets show that BDFF can improve the performance of PSO on large-scale feature selection and obtain smaller feature subsets with higher classification accuracy.",IEEE Transactions on Big Data,journal,9cc701cf-1f49-4121-8ea9-11bac24d61ad,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,1004-1017,9,,2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,"Jia-Quan Yang, Qi-Te Yang, Ke-Jing Du, Chun-Hua Chen, Hua Wang, Sang-Woon Jeon, Jinchao Zhang, Zhi-hui Zhan","2167905528, 2187161662, 2196699, 2168924226, 2197900893, 1699638, 27672597, 1680620",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b94342c6c5a493f8bad55c030ab1319c05b597a6,Computer Science,2167905528,['JournalArticle'],23.0,60.0

To overcome the shortcomings in the existing university teaching quality assessment procedure, this paper designs an evaluation model for physical education departments based on long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). The model is constructed by analyzing the connotation and index system of teacher education teaching quality and constructing a fan-leaf structure model of teacher education teaching quality. Then, an improved PSO-LSTM model is proposed to train the teaching samples. The evaluation model applies the improved LSTM model and optimizes the network structure by dynamically adjusting the learning rate. The model is then optimized for the number of neurons and iterations of the network using the improved PSO. The results of the experiment indicate that the proposed model is effective in evaluating the quality of physical education. Moreover, the model analysis’ accuracy has greatly improved.

We intended to investigate nonlinear relationships typical of the atmospheric variables using state-of-the-art ML methods for more accurate rainfall predictions. For this research project on rainfall forecasting in the USA, we utilized an extensive dataset that comprises historical rainfall data collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other meteorological agencies. The main dataset we use in this paper consists of daily rainfall measurements across various geographical locations of the USA, thus capturing the wide-ranging historical data necessary for both training and validation of the model. Besides measuring rainfall, we included meteorological data from sources such as NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications. These datasets further provided key variables that are known to affect rain, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The performance metrics used in this research work for the models considered include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The above table shows that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other models, achieving perfect accuracy. That indicated that it rightly classified all the instances in the test set. The Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models gave a quite good performance by giving above average accuracy but had lower precision and recall for the rainfall prediction. Accurate rainfall forecasting has direct consequences on agriculture, greatly empowering farmers and agricultural planners to make more effective decisions regarding planting, harvesting, and crop management. The forecasts of rainfall are also of critical importance in disaster management regarding planning for flood emergencies. Moreover, precise forecasting of rainfall, particularly in sustainable water resources management, presents the most important data in planning for and conserving these resources.",Journal of Environmental and Agricultural Studies,journal,b843beae-7645-4217-9445-0f380ec83b64,Journal of Environmental and Agricultural Studies,,,,2024,2024-11-09 00:00:00,"Abdullah Al Mukaddim, MD Rashed Mohaimin, Mohammad Abir Hider, Mitu Karmakar, Md Nasiruddin, Shah Alam, Farhana Rahman Anonna","2324999202, 2330095522, 2324991673, 2327913220, 2300776156, 2330092919, 2330094449",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfca42eafdd857b52a16778a31b49e35e1b7e353,"Computer Science, Environmental Science",2324999202,['JournalArticle'],7.0,0.0

The disproportionate spatial accumulation of a drug in the interstitium is determined by several microenvironmental properties (blood vessel distribution and permeability, gradients in the interstitial fluid pressure). Predictions of tumour perfusion are key determinants of drug delivery and responsiveness to therapy. Pharmacokinetic models allow for the quantification of tracer perfusion based on contrast enhancement measured with non-invasive imaging techniques. An advanced cross-voxel exchange model (CVXM) was recently developed to provide a comprehensive description of tracer extravasation as well as advection and diffusion based on cross-voxel tracer kinetics (Sinno et al 2021). Transport parameters were derived from DCE-MRI of twenty TS-415 human cervical carcinoma xenografts by using CVXM. Tracer velocity flows were measured at the tumour periphery (mean 1.78–5.82 μm.s−1) pushing the contrast outward towards normal tissue. These elevated velocity measures and extravasation rates explain the heterogeneous distribution of tracer across the tumour and its accumulation at the periphery. Significant values for diffusivity were deduced across the tumours (mean 152–499 μm2.s−1). CVXM resulted in generally smaller values for the extravasation parameter Kext (mean 0.01–0.04 min−1) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction ve (mean 0.05–0.17) compared to the standard Tofts parameters, suggesting that Toft model underestimates the effects of inter-voxel exchange. The ratio of Tofts’ extravasation parameters over CVXM’s was significantly positively correlated to the cross-voxel diffusivity (P < 0.0001) and velocity (P = 0.0005). Tofts’ increased ve measurements were explained using Sinno et al (2021)’s theoretical work. Finally, a scan time of 15 min renders informative estimations of the transport parameters. However, a duration as low as 7.5 min is acceptable to recognize the spatial variation of transport parameters. The results demonstrate the potential of utilizing CVXM for determining metrics characterizing the exchange of tracer between the vasculature and the tumour tissue. Like for many earlier models, additional work is strongly recommended, in terms of validation, to develop more confidence in the results, motivating future laboratory work in this regard.",Physics in Medicine and Biology,journal,d5594aad-095f-4587-802a-b011732c7100,Physics in Medicine & Biology,,67,,2022,2022-11-22 00:00:00,"N.

Some of the most common models employed in clinical practice, such as the standard Tofts model (STM) or the extended Tofts model (ETM), do not account for passive delivery of contrast agent (CA) through diffusion. In this work, we introduce a diffusive term based on the concept of effective diffusivity into a finite element (FE) implementation of the ETM formulation, obtaining a new formulation for the diffusion-corrected ETM (D-ETM). A gradient-based optimization algorithm is developed to characterize the vascular properties of the tumour from the CA concentration curves obtained from imaging clinical data. To test the potential of our approach, several theoretical distributions of CA concentration are generated on a benchmark problem and a real tumour geometry. The vascular properties used to generate these distributions are estimated from an inverse analysis based on both the ETM and the D-ETM approaches. The outcome of these analyses shows the limitations of the ETM to retrieve accurate parameters in the presence of diffusion. The ETM returns smoothed distributions of vascular properties, reaching unphysical values in some of them, while the D-ETM accurately depicted the heterogeneity of KTrans, ve\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$_{e}$$\end{document} and vp\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$_{p}$$\end{document} distributions (mean absolute relative difference (ARD) of 16%, 15% and 9%, respectively, for the real geometry case) keeping all their values within their physiological ranges, outperforming the ETM.",Engineering computations,journal,47ba6266-85d0-494a-a55a-927f8c599119,Engineering with Computers,3849 - 3865,38,,2022,2022-06-01 00:00:00,"D.

Furthermore, the performance of genetic factors in predicting dyslipidaemia has not been explored. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate prediction models with and without genetic factors for dyslipidaemia in rural populations. A total of 3596 individuals from the Henan Rural Cohort Study were included in this study. According to the ratio of 7:3, all individuals were divided into a training set and a testing set. The conventional models and conventional+GRS (genetic risk score) models were developed with Cox regression, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifiers in the training set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI) were used to assess the discrimination ability of the models, and the calibration curve was used to show calibration ability in the testing set. Compared to the lowest quartile of GRS, the hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of individuals in the highest quartile of GRS was 1.23(1.07, 1.41) in the total population. Age, family history of diabetes, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were used to develop the conventional models, and the AUCs of the Cox, ANN, RF, and GBM classifiers were 0.702(0.673, 0.729), 0.736(0.708, 0.762), 0.787 (0.762, 0.811), and 0.816(0.792, 0.839), respectively.

If not, they could be uncurable and deadly. Due to this reason, there is a need of analysing complex medical data, medical reports, and medical images at a lesser time but with greater accuracy. There are even some instances where certain abnormalities cannot be directly recognized by humans. In healthcare for computational decision making, machine learning approaches are being used in these types of situations where a crucial data analysis needs to be performed on medical data to reveal hidden relationships or abnormalities which are not visible to humans. Implementing algorithms to perform such tasks itself is difficult, but what makes it even more challenging is to increase the accuracy of the algorithm while decreasing the required time for the algorithm to execute. In the early days, processing of large amount of medical data was an important task which resulted in machine learning being adapted in the biological domain. Since this happened, the biology and biomedical fields have been reaching higher levels by exploring more knowledge and identifying relationships which were never observed before. Reaching to its peak now the concern is being diverted towards treating patients not only based on the type of disease but also their genetics, which is known as precision medicine. Modifications in machine learning algorithms are being performed and tested daily to improve the performance of the algorithms in analysing and presenting more accurate information. In the healthcare field, starting from information extraction from medical documents until the prediction or diagnosis of a disease, machine learning has been involved. Medical imaging is a section that was greatly improved with the integration of machine learning algorithms to the field of computational biology. Nowadays, many disease diagnoses are being performed by medical image processing using machine learning algorithms. In addition, patient care, resource allocation, and research on treatments for various diseases are also being performed using machine learning-based computational decision making. Throughout this paper, various machine learning algorithms and approaches that are being used for decision making in the healthcare sector will be discussed along with the involvement of machine learning in healthcare applications in the current context. With the explored knowledge, it was evident that neural network-based deep learning methods have performed extremely well in the field of computational biology with the support of the high processing power of modern sophisticated computers and are being extensively applied because of their high predicting accuracy and reliability. When giving concern towards the big picture by combining the observations, it is noticeable that computational biology and biomedicine-based decision making in healthcare have now become dependent on machine learning algorithms, and thus they cannot be separated from the field of artificial intelligence.",Journal of Healthcare Engineering,journal,946e893f-4e7f-47c5-8544-15aa5a2cc679,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,,2021,,2021,2021-01-27 00:00:00,"S.

Furthermore, the performance of genetic factors in predicting dyslipidaemia has not been explored. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate prediction models with and without genetic factors for dyslipidaemia in rural populations. Methods A total of 3596 individuals from the Henan Rural Cohort Study were included in this study. According to the ratio of 7:3, all individuals were divided into a training set and a testing set. The conventional models and conventional+GRS (genetic risk score) models were developed with Cox regression, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifiers in the training set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI) were used to assess the discrimination ability of the models, and the calibration curve was used to show calibration ability in the testing set. Results Compared to the lowest quartile of GRS, the hazard ratio ( HR ) (95% confidence interval ( CI )) of individuals in the highest quartile of GRS was 1.23(1.07, 1.41) in the total population. Age, family history of diabetes, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were used to develop the conventional models, and the AUCs of the Cox, ANN, RF, and GBM classifiers were 0.702(0.673, 0.729), 0.736(0.708, 0.762), 0.787 (0.762, 0.811), and 0.816(0.792, 0.839), respectively.

Nevertheless, in many real-world applications one of the domains is reduced, i.e., scarce. This means that it has much less training data available in comparison to the other domain, which is fully observable. In order to tackle the problem of using CycleGAN framework in such unfavorable application scenarios, we propose and invoke a novel Bootstrapped SSL CycleGAN architecture (BTS-SSL), where the mentioned problem is overcome using two strategies. Firstly, by using a relatively small percentage of available labelled training data from the reduced or scarce domain and a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach, we prevent overfitting of the discriminator belonging to the reduced domain, which would otherwise occur during initial training iterations due to the small amount of available training data in the scarce domain. Secondly, after initial learning guided by the described SSL strategy, additional bootstrapping (BTS) of the reduced data domain is performed by inserting artifically generated training examples into the training poll of the data discriminator belonging to the scarce domain. Bootstrapped samples are generated by the already trained neural network that performs transferring from the fully observable to the scarce domain. The described procedure is periodically repeated during the training process several times and results in significantly improved performance of the final model in comparison to the original unsupervised CycleGAN approach. The same also holds in comparison to the solutions that are exclusively based either on the described SSL, or on the bootstrapping strategy, i.e., when these are applied separately. Moreover, in the considered scarce scenarios it also shows competitive results in comparison to the fully supervised solution based on the pix2pix method. In that sense, it is directly applicable to many domain transfer tasks that are relying on the CycleGAN architecture.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2022,2022-03-27 00:00:00,"Lidija Krstanović, Branislav M.

Although building a speaker recognition model on a closed set of speakers under neutral speaking conditions is a well-researched task and there are solutions that provide excellent performance, the classification accuracy of developed models significantly decreases when applying them to emotional speech or in the presence of interference. Furthermore, deep models may require a large number of parameters, so constrained solutions are desirable in order to implement them on edge devices in the Internet of Things systems for real-time detection. The aim of this paper is to propose a simple and constrained convolutional neural network for speaker recognition tasks and to examine its robustness for recognition in emotional speech conditions. We examine three quantization methods for developing a constrained network: floating-point eight format, ternary scalar quantization, and binary scalar quantization.

In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature that aims to identify the state of the art of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the process of diagnosing and identification of plant pest and diseases. In addition, it presents some issues that are facing the models performance, and also indicates gaps that should be addressed in the future.

The SDN enables the network operators to manage the overall network consistently and holistically, regardless the complexity of infrastructure devices. The promising features of the SDN enhance network security and facilitate the implementation of threat detection systems through software applications using open APIs. However, the emerging technology creates new security concerns and new threats that do not exist in the current traditional networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) are one of the most rampant attacks that can interrupt the functionality of the network and make most of the network services unreachable for network users. The efficient identification of DDos attacks on SDN environments in literature is still a challenge because of the number of network features taken into account and the overhead of applying machine learning based anomaly detection techniques. Hence, in this paper, we aim to use two popular feature selection methods, i.e., Information Gain (IG) and Random Forest (RF) in order to analyse the most comprehensive relevant features of DDoS attacks in SDN networks. Using the most relevant features will improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection system and reduce the false alarm rates. Moreover, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) technique based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoencoder to tackle the problem of DDoS attacks in SDNs. We perform our analysis and evaluation on three different datasets, i.e., InSDN, CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018. We also measure the overhead of the proposed DL model on the SDN controller and test the network performance in terms of network throughput and end-to-end latency. The results validate that the DL approach can efficiently identify DDoS attacks in SDN environments without any significant degradation in the controller performance.",IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,journal,65e58b80-9699-4da6-bd60-929b57b8533d,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,1862-1880,8,,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,"Mahmoud Said El Sayed, Nhien-An Le-Khac, Marianne A.

The IoT layer contains various intelligent IoT devices that generate a large number of tasks, each characterized by distinct specifications such as size, computational demand, communication requirements, and latency constraints. owing to the limited storage and computing capacity of resource-constrained IoT devices, it is essential to offload these tasks to different layers to ensure effective processing while satisfying the required Quality of Service (QoS) goals. To address this challenge, a fuzzy logic-based task scheduler is employed to make informed offloading decisions, considering task attributes and determining the most suitable processing layers—whether locally at the IoT layer, on collaborative fog nodes, or in the cloud. Furthermore, the study leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) method, a form of deep reinforcement learning, to identify the optimal fog node for offloading tasks and to maintain a balanced workload distribution across collaborative fog nodes. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of latency, power consumption, network usage, throughput, and offloading rate in comparison with the Non-offload, First-Fit, GASDEO, and NAFITO-FLA methods.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,39936-39952,12,,2024,,"Dezheen H.

A complete IoT system includes devices, sensors, networks, software, and other essential components necessary for operation and interconnection. However, devices and sensors of this nature often have low resource requirements and multiple security vulnerabilities from manufacturers. Moreover, edge network areas of IoT systems exhibit several security weaknesses. Consequently, unauthorized hijacking of sensors or denial-of-service attacks on edge network areas can have severe consequences for the system’s operation. In this study, we propose a model that combines machine learning algorithms and principal component analysis techniques to train and predict Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Principal component analysis techniques were applied to reduce data dimensionality. We used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score as the evaluation metrics. We explain the True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, and False Negative measures as basic parts of the above evaluation metrics. Unlike previous studies, we used the Training Time to evaluate the training time of each model. We employed two datasets, CICIDS 2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS 2018, to evaluate our proposed model.

The rate of key distribution is low and decreases exponentially with increasing distance. A classic trusted relay (CTR) uses additional keys to enhance security distance in QKD networks. In practice, the assurance of security for certain relay nodes is still lacking, despite the fact that CTR requires that all nodes be trusted. Owing to channel unreliability, system faults accumulate during the key relay, thereby increasing the probability of CTR failing to distribute the secret key. The failure of a successful key relay would then result in the subsequent destruction of all the keys involved in the process, which leads to the wasting of the quantum secret key and reduction system encryption. Hence, alleviating the effect of CTR failure for the purpose of obtaining key security distribution of distant quantum network is necessary issue to tackle. Therefore, a new scheme is needed in order to overcome the above-mentioned issues to come up with a better utilization of the generated keys. In this study, a software-defined networking (SDN) technique is introduced to circumvent this drawback by utilising the flexibility provided by the SDN paradigm for better QKD network management. In particular, a novel survivability model called software-defined quantum key relay failure (SDQKRF) is proposed in this paper in which a new function is developed and added to the SDN controller. According to the simulation results, SDN over a QKD network using the SDQKRF model is more reliable and performs better in terms of the key generation ratio, key utilisation rate, recovery after failure, avalanche effect, and service blocking rate than a regular QKD network without the SDQTRF model.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,21641-21654,11,,2023,,"Omar Shirko, S.

Offloading can be utilized to transfer resource-intensive tasks from resource-limited end devices to a resource-rich fog or cloud layer to reduce end-to-end latency and enhance the performance of the system. However, this advantage is still challenging to achieve in systems with a high request rate because it leads to long queues of tasks in fog nodes and reveals inefficiencies in terms of delays. In this regard, reinforcement learning (RL) is a well-known method for addressing such decision-making issues. However, in large-scale wireless networks, both action and state spaces are complex and extremely extensive. Consequently, reinforcement learning techniques may not be able to identify an efficient strategy within an acceptable time frame. Hence, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed to integrate RL and deep learning (DL) to address this problem. This paper presents a systematic analysis of using RL or DRL algorithms to address offloading-related issues in fog computing. First, the taxonomy of fog computing offloading mechanisms based on RL and DRL algorithms was divided into three major categories: value-based, policy-based, and hybrid-based algorithms. These categories were then compared based on important features, including offloading problem formulation, utilized techniques, performance metrics, evaluation tools, case studies, their strengths and drawbacks, offloading directions, offloading mode, SDN-based architecture, and offloading decisions. Finally, the future research directions and open issues are discussed thoroughly.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,12554-12585,11,,2023,,"Dezheen H.

Thus, heart-disease prediction has garnered considerable attention in the medical domain globally. Accordingly, machine-learning algorithms for the early prediction of heart diseases were developed in several studies to help physicians design medical procedures. In this study, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) optimized approach based on random forest (RF), called GAPSO-RF, is developed and used to select the optimal features that can increase the accuracy of heart-disease prediction. The proposed GAPSO-RF implements multivariate statistical analysis in the first step to select the most significant features used in the initial population. After that, a discriminate mutation strategy is implemented in GA. GAPSO-RF combines a modified GA for global search and a PSO for local search. Moreover, PSO achieved the concept of rehabbing individuals that had been refused in the selection process. The performance of the proposed GAPSO-RF approach is validated via evaluation metrics, namely, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by using two datasets from the University of California, namely, Cleveland and Statlog. The experimental results confirm that the GAPSO-RF approach attained the high heart-disease-prediction accuracies of 95.6% and 91.4% on the Cleveland and Statlog datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperformed other state-of-the-art prediction methods.",Multimedia tools and applications,journal,477368e9-7a8e-475a-8c93-6d623797fd06,Multimedia Tools and Applications,18155 - 18179,81,,2022,2022-03-08 00:00:00,"Mohamed G.

In this work, the effects of prickly ash on key taste compounds in stewed sheep tail fat soup were investigated. Results showed that the taste intensity of sheep tail fat soup cooked with 0.2% prickly ash increased significantly. The concentration of organic acids and free amino acids in sheep tail fat soup significantly increased with the addition of prickly ash. The concentration of succinic acid (2.637 to 4.580 mg/g) and Thr (2.558 to 12.466 mg/g) increased the most among organic acids and amino acids, respectively. Spearman’s correlation analysis elucidated that seven taste compounds were positively correlated (correlation coefficient > 0.7) with the overall taste intensity of the soup sample including Thr, Asp, oxalic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, and ascorbic acid. Additional experiments and quantitative descriptive analysis further confirmed that Asp, lactic acid and citric acid were the key taste compounds to improve saltiness and umami taste in sheep tail fat soup with prickly ash.",Foods,journal,e9a44b89-3d84-4bff-8c78-c53cd2ad7cf8,Foods,,11,,2022,2022-03-22 00:00:00,"Yan Huang, Dandan Pu, Zhilin Hao, Li Liang, Jing Zhao, Yizhuang Tang, Yuyu Zhang","2155605291, 30451093, 2147215420, 2087343708, 2151692457, 1560603063, 2108306996",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40fe4fbb9f6bbbf733cc3bd3bf7b0dd06d2e6731,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Medicine",2155605291,['JournalArticle'],11.0,42.0

Traditional vapor-compression air conditioners exhibit a lower coefficient of performance (COP) (typically 2.8–3.8) owing to the cooling-based dehumidification methods that handle both sensible and latent loads together. Temperature- and humidity-independent control or desiccant systems have been proposed to overcome these challenges; however, the COP of current desiccant systems is quite small and additional heat sources are usually needed. Here, we report on a desiccant-enhanced, direct expansion heat pump based on a water-sorbing heat exchanger with a desiccant coating that exhibits an ultrahigh COP value of more than 7 without sacrificing any comfort or compactness. The pump’s efficiency is doubled compared to that of pumps currently used in conventional room air conditioners, which is a revolutionary HVAC breakthrough. Our proposed water-sorbing heat exchanger can independently handle sensible and latent loads at the same time. The desiccants adsorb moisture almost isothermally and can be regenerated by condensation heat. This new approach opens up the possibility of achieving ultrahigh efficiency for a broad range of temperature- and humidity-control applications.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,7,,2017,2017-01-12 00:00:00,"Y.

The system is an autonomous unit requiring an external 12 V power supply. Four simultaneous reactions are performed in the form of virtual reaction chambers (VRCs) where a ≈200 nL sample is covered with mineral oil and placed on a glass cover slip. Fast, 40 cycle amplification of an amplicon from the H7N9 gene was used to demonstrate the PCR performance. The standard curve slope was -3.02 ± 0.16 cycles at threshold per decade (mean ± standard deviation) corresponding to an amplification efficiency of 0.91 ± 0.05 per cycle (mean ± standard deviation). The PCR device was capable of detecting a single deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy. These results further suggest that our handheld PCR device may have broad, technologically-relevant applications extending to rapid detection of infectious diseases in small clinics.",Lab on a Chip,journal,5361f7b6-ede4-4f32-8694-9d5472e7a41b,Lab on a chip,"

Post-industrialized countries are particularly prone to an ever-increasing number of ageing individuals and ageing-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with volume loss in the affected brain. MRI diagnoses and monitoring of subtle volume changes in the ageing/diseased brains have the potential to become standard diagnostic tools. Even with the superior resolution of 7 T MRI scanners, the microstructural changes comprising cell types, cell numbers, and cellular processes, are still undetectable. Knowledge of origin, nature, and progression for microstructural changes are necessary to understand pathogenetic stages in the relentless neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to develop therapeutic tools that delay or stop neurodegenerative processes at their earliest stage. We illustrate the gap in resolution by comparing the identical regions of the post-mortem in situ 7 T MR images (virtual autopsy or virtopsy) with the histological observations in serial sections through the same brain. We also described the protocols and limitations associated with these comparisons, as well as the necessity of supercomputers and data management for “Big data”. Analysis of neuron and/or glial number by using a body of mathematical tools and guidelines (stereology) is time-consuming, cumbersome, and still restricted to trained human investigators. Development of tools based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) could considerably accelerate studies on localization, onset, and progression of neuron loss. Finally, these observations could disentangle the mechanisms of volume loss into stages of reversible atrophy and/or irreversible fatal cell death. This AI- and ML-based cooperation between virtopsy and histology could bridge the present gap between virtual reality and neuropathology. It could also culminate in the creation of an imaging-associated comprehensive database. This database would include genetic, clinical, epidemiological, and technical aspects that could help to alleviate or even stop the adverse effects of neurodegenerative diseases on affected individuals, their families, and society.",Brain Informatics,journal,b409d450-86da-43c3-b686-a9eb1f61675c,Brain Informatics,,6,,2019,2019-03-07 00:00:00,"S.

It advances dynamic resource allocation and power management. This study employs deep neural networks including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) techniques to one-hour-ahead forecast the volume of expected traffic and compares this approach to other methods including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). The deep neural network implementation in this study analyses, evaluates and generates predictions based on the data of telecommunications activity every one hour, continuously in one year, released by Viettel Telecom in Vietnam. The performance indexes, including RMSE, MAPE, MAE, R and Theil’s U are used to make comparison of the developed models. The obtained results show that both LSTM and GRU model outperformed the ANFIS, ANN and GMDH models. The research findings are expected to provide an assistance and forecasting tool for telecom network operators.

Early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis, which is critical in reducing mortality, is challenging as many of its signs and symptoms are similar to other less critical conditions. We develop an artificial intelligence algorithm, SERA algorithm, which uses both structured data and unstructured clinical notes to predict and diagnose sepsis. We test this algorithm with independent, clinical notes and achieve high predictive accuracy 12 hours before the onset of sepsis (AUC 0.94, sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.87). We compare the SERA algorithm against physician predictions and show the algorithm’s potential to increase the early detection of sepsis by up to 32% and reduce false positives by up to 17%. Mining unstructured clinical notes is shown to improve the algorithm’s accuracy compared to using only clinical measures for early warning 12 to 48 hours before the onset of sepsis.

Molecular approaches such as reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers highly sensitive and specific means to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, however, despite it being the accepted “gold standard”, molecular platforms often require a tradeoff between speed versus throughput. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)—time of flight (TOF)—mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed as a potential solution for COVID-19 testing and finding a balance between analytical performance, speed, and throughput, without relying on impacted supply chains. Combined with machine learning (ML), this MALDI-TOF-MS approach could overcome logistical barriers encountered by current testing paradigms. We evaluated the analytical performance of an ML-enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS method for screening COVID-19. Residual nasal swab samples from adult volunteers were used for testing and compared against RT-PCR. Two optimized ML models were identified, exhibiting accuracy of 98.3%, positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100%, negative percent agreement (NPA) of 96%, and accuracy of 96.6%, PPA of 98.5%, and NPA of 94% respectively.

Clinical decisions including prescription and timing of antibiotics, ordering of additional diagnostics and level-of-care decisions rely on understanding etiology and implications of a clinical presentation. Host mRNA signatures can differentiate infectious from noninfectious etiologies, bacterial from viral infections, and predict 30-day mortality. The 29-host-mRNA blood-based InSepTM test (Inflammatix, Burlingame, CA, formerly known as HostDxTM Sepsis) combines machine learning algorithms with a rapid point-of-care platform with less than 30 min turnaround time to enable rapid diagnosis of acute infections and sepsis, as well as prediction of disease severity. A scientific advisory panel including emergency medicine, infectious disease, intensive care and clinical pathology physicians discussed technical and clinical requirements in preparation of successful introduction of InSep into the market. Topics included intended use; patient populations of greatest need; patient journey and sample flow in the emergency department (ED) and beyond; clinical and biomarker-based decision algorithms; performance characteristics for clinical utility; assay and instrument requirements; and result readouts. The panel identified clear demand for a solution like InSep, requirements regarding test performance and interpretability, and a need for focused medical education due to the innovative but complex nature of the result readout. Innovative diagnostic solutions such as the InSep test could improve management of patients with suspected acute infections and sepsis in the ED, thereby lessening the overall burden of these conditions on patients and the healthcare system.",Journal of Personalized Medicine,journal,721ed878-9136-408b-b2a3-dce27b9fa39e,Journal of Personalized Medicine,,10,,2020,2020-12-01 00:00:00,"J.

Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) technology is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. ABSTRACT Highly accurate testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the point of care (POC) is an unmet diagnostic need in emergency care and time-sensitive outpatient care settings. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) technology is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. We performed a multisite U.S. study comparing the clinical performance of the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized POC RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 min, the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B nucleic acid test, to the most widely used RT-PCR laboratory test, the cobas 68/8800 SARS-CoV-2 test. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 444 patients with 357 evaluable specimens at five U.S. clinical laboratories were enrolled from 21 September 2020 to 23 October 2020. The overall agreement between the Liat and 68/8800 systems for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics was 98.6% (352/357). Using Liat, positive percent agreement for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (162/162) and the negative percent agreement was 97.4% (190/195). The Liat is an RT-PCR POC test that provides highly accurate SARS-CoV-2 results in 20 min with performance equivalent to that of high-throughput laboratory molecular testing.

This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the development of theoretical models in the area of social media crisis communication and management. The study aims to review and analyse the relationship of social media-based crisis communication in the context of crisis informatics and its taxonomy and the related crisis communication theoretical models to derive the challenges and limitations. A total of 207 articles were selected for the evaluation based on quality, relevancy, and contribution. The findings revealed that the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) is the most dominant theory, followed by social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) and integrated crisis mapping (ICM) models. The study identified theories such as the STREMII model, social media crisis management matrix/framework (SMSMF), and an interactive crisis communication model (ICCM) as emerging models. Moreover, the result of the finding shows that stakeholder interaction is an understudied field, while information reliability and processing for decision-making purposes, the wider application of social media sites, privacy issues, and how social media interaction can improve community resilience or build stakeholders relationships remain suitable topics for future research.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,185842-185869,8,,2020,2020-10-12 00:00:00,"U.

They will include vehicles of all kinds, medical and industrial robots, agricultural and manufacturing facilities, traffic management systems, and much more. While many organizations strive to develop the next generation of trustworthy, cost-effective autonomous systems, a major gap exists between the challenges in developing these and the state of the art. There is a crucial need for a common scientific and engineering foundation for developing these systems, which we term “autonomics.” We believe that such a foundation will dramatically accelerate the deployment and acceptance of high-quality autonomous systems, for the benefit of human society. The potential benefits of autonomous systems are obvious. However, there are still major issues to be dealt with before developing such systems becomes a commonplace engineering practice, with accepted and trustworthy deliverables. We argue that a solid, evolving, publicly available, community-controlled foundation for developing next-generation autonomous systems is a must, and term the desired foundation “autonomics.” We focus on three main challenges: 1) how to specify autonomous system behavior in the face of unpredictability; 2) how to carry out faithful analysis of system behavior with respect to rich environments that include humans, physical artifacts, and other systems; and 3) how to build such systems by combining executable modeling techniques from software engineering with artificial intelligence and machine learning.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,journal,bb95bf2e-8383-4748-bf9d-d6906d091085,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,17491 - 17498,117,,2019,2019-11-17 00:00:00,"D.

In parallel, a method to optimize the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of PET detectors by use of the DOI information is proposed and tested. For these purposes, a dedicated 64-channels readout setup has been developed with intrinsic timing resolution of 16 ps FWHM. Several PET modules have been produced, based on LYSO:Ce scintillators and commercial silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays, with mm2 individual SiPM size. The results show the possibility to achieve a timing resolution of 157 ps FWHM, combined with the already demonstrated spatial resolution of 1.5 mm FWHM, DOI resolution of 3 mm FWHM, and energy resolution of 9% FWHM at 511 keV, with 15 mm long crystals of section mm2 and mm2.

6236a56c9ffaa3f96c17b90e3f93cf1604db8aec,10.1002/mp.12906,"An edge‐readout, multilayer detector for positron emission tomography","Purpose We present a novel gamma‐ray‐detector design based on total internal reflection (TIR) of scintillation photons within a crystal that addresses many limitations of traditional PET detectors. Our approach has appealing features, including submillimeter lateral resolution, DOI positioning from layer thickness, and excellent energy resolution. The design places light sensors on the edges of a stack of scintillator slabs separated by small air gaps and exploits the phenomenon that more than 80% of scintillation light emitted during a gamma‐ray event reaches the edges of a thin crystal with polished faces due to TIR. Gamma‐ray stopping power is achieved by stacking multiple layers, and DOI is determined by which layer the gamma ray interacts in. Method The concept of edge readouts of a thin slab was verified by Monte Carlo simulation of scintillation light transport. An LYSO crystal of dimensions 50.8 mm × 50.8 mm × 3.0 mm was modeled with five rectangular SiPMs placed along each edge face. The mean‐detector‐response functions (MDRFs) were calculated by simulating signals from 511 keV gamma‐ray interactions in a grid of locations. Simulations were carried out to study the influence of choice of scintillator material and dimensions, gamma‐ray photon energies, introduction of laser or mechanically induced optical barriers (LIOBs, MIOBs), and refractive indices of optical‐coupling media and SiPM windows. We also analyzed timing performance including influence of gamma‐ray interaction position and presence of optical barriers. We also modeled and built a prototype detector, a 27.4 mm × 27.4 mm × 3.0 mm CsI(Tl) crystal with 4 SiPMs per edge to experimentally validate the results predicted by the simulations. The prototype detector used CsI(Tl) crystals from Proteus outfitted with 16 Hamamatsu model S13360‐6050PE MPPCs read out by an AiT‐16‐channel readout. The MDRFs were measured by scanning the detector with a collimated beam of 662‐keV photons from a 137Cs source. The spatial resolution was experimentally determined by imaging a tungsten slit that created a beam of 0.44 mm (FWHM) width normal to the detector surface. The energy resolution was evaluated by analyzing list‐mode data from flood illumination by the 137Cs source. Result We find that in a block‐detector‐sized LYSO layer read out by five SiPMs per edge, illuminated by 511‐keV photons, the average resolution is 1.49 mm (FWHM). With the introduction of optical barriers, average spatial resolution improves to 0.56 mm (FWHM). The DOI resolution is the layer thickness of 3.0 mm. We also find that optical‐coupling media and SiPM‐window materials have an impact on spatial resolution. The timing simulation with LYSO crystal yields a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of 200–400 ps, which is slightly position dependent. And the introduction of optical barriers has minimum influence. The prototype CsI(Tl) detector, with a smaller area and fewer SiPMs, was measured to have central‐area spatial resolutions of 0.70 and 0.39 mm without and with optical barriers, respectively. These results match well with our simulations. An energy resolution of 6.4% was achieved at 662 keV. Conclusion A detector design based on a stack of monolithic scintillator layers that uses edge readouts offers several advantages over current block detectors for PET. For example, there is no tradeoff between spatial resolution and detection sensitivity since no reflector material displaces scintillator crystal, and submillimeter resolution can be achieved. DOI information is readily available, and excellent timing and energy resolutions are possible.",Medical Physics (Lancaster),journal,4e90b61b-3ae1-4b4c-9348-d67a3825e703,Medical Physics,2425 - 2438,45,,2018,2018-05-06 00:00:00,"Xin Li, Maria Ruiz-Gonzalez, L.

 The geochemistry of Cenozoic intracontinental high-Mg andesites (HMAs) in northeast Asia, together with regional geophysical data, offers an opportunity to explore the genetic relationship between the formation of intracontinental HMAs and subduction of the Pacific plate. Compared with primary HMAs in arcs, Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia have lower Mg# [100 × Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)] values (53–56) and CaO contents (5.8–6.6 wt%), higher alkali (Na2O + K2O) contents (5.15–6.45 wt%), and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7056–0.7059; εNd = −4.9 to −3.4; εHf = −4.7 to −2.6) as well as lower Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb = 16.76–19.19; 207Pb/204Pb = 15.42–15.45; 208Pb/204Pb = 36.71–37.11). These Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs are similar to Cenozoic potassic basalts in northeast China with respect to their Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions but have higher SiO2 and Al2O3 contents and lower K2O, MgO, and light rare earth element contents. These features indicate that these Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs originated from the mantle, where recycled ancient sediments and water contributed to partial melting of peridotite. Combined with the presence of a large low-resistivity anomaly derived from the mantle transition zone (MTZ) near these intracontinental HMAs, and their occurrence above the stagnant slab front within the MTZ (at 600 km depth) in northeast Asia, we conclude that the stagnant slab front, with high contents of recycled ancient sediments and water, has controlled the formation of Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia.",Geology,journal,c152ea18-c087-4170-bce5-8c752e71e7c8,Geology,,,,2020,2020-08-07 00:00:00,"Wenliang Xu, Jia-hui Chen, A.

In particular, physiological signals are widely used to detect and classify affective states in lab conditions. However, physiological reactions to emotional stimuli have been found to differ in laboratory and natural settings. Thanks to recent technological progress (e.g., in wearables) the creation of EMSR systems for a large number of consumers during their everyday activities is increasingly possible. Therefore, datasets created in the wild are needed to insure the validity and the exploitability of EMSR models for real-life applications. In this paper, we initially present common techniques used in laboratory settings to induce emotions for the purpose of physiological dataset creation. Next, advantages and challenges of data collection in the wild are discussed. To assess the applicability of existing datasets to real-life applications, we propose a set of categories to guide and compare at a glance different methodologies used by researchers to collect such data. For this purpose, we also introduce a visual tool called Graphical Assessment of Real-life Application-Focused Emotional Dataset (GARAFED). In the last part of the paper, we apply the proposed tool to compare existing physiological datasets for EMSR in the wild and to show possible improvements and future directions of research. We wish for this paper and GARAFED to be used as guidelines for researchers and developers who aim at collecting affect-related data for real-life EMSR-based applications.",Frontiers in Psychology,journal,89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06,Frontiers in Psychology,,11,,2020,2020-07-15 00:00:00,"Fanny Larradet, Radoslaw Niewiadomski, G.

Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.",BMC Genomics,journal,8dcbaea5-3cdb-48b3-9f93-45c12ca1bb91,BMC Genomics,,21,,2020,2020-01-02 00:00:00,"D.

However, other types of data to which these models can be applied have not yet been explored as thoroughly. Labelling is an indispensable stage of data pre-processing that can be particularly challenging, especially when applied to single or multi-model real-time sensor data collection approaches. Currently, real-time sensor data labelling is an unwieldy process, with a limited range of tools available and poor performance characteristics, which can lead to the performance of the machine learning models being compromised. In this paper, we introduce new techniques for labelling at the point of collection coupled with a pilot study and a systematic performance comparison of two popular types of deep neural networks running on five custom built devices and a comparative mobile app (68.5–89% accuracy within-device GRU model, 92.8% highest LSTM model accuracy). These devices are designed to enable real-time labelling with various buttons, slide potentiometer and force sensors. This exploratory work illustrates several key features that inform the design of data collection tools that can help researchers select and apply appropriate labelling techniques to their work. We also identify common bottlenecks in each architecture and provide field tested guidelines to assist in building adaptive, high-performance edge solutions.",Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,journal,68fd8242-3be0-4b1e-8b5d-ad0a8a02db12,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,709 - 722,24,,2019,2019-10-03 00:00:00,"Kieran Woodward, E.

Our method combines a unique problem representation and an unbiased optimization protocol to learn from mirBase19.0 an accurate predictive model, termed MiRduplexSVM. This is the first model that provides precise information about all four ends of the miRNA duplex. We show that (a) our method outperforms four state-of-the-art tools, namely MaturePred, MiRPara, MatureBayes, MiRdup as well as a Simple Geometric Locator when applied on the same training datasets employed for each tool and evaluated on a common blind test set. (b) In all comparisons, MiRduplexSVM shows superior performance, achieving up to a 60% increase in prediction accuracy for mammalian hairpins and can generalize very well on plant hairpins, without any special optimization. (c) The tool has a number of important applications such as the ability to accurately predict the miRNA or the miRNA*, given the opposite strand of a duplex. Its performance on this task is superior to the 2nts overhang rule commonly used in computational studies and similar to that of a comparative genomic approach, without the need for prior knowledge or the complexity of performing multiple alignments. Finally, it is able to evaluate novel, potential miRNAs found either computationally or experimentally.

These molecules silence their target genes by degrading transcription or suppressing translation. Studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in biological responses to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Identification of these molecules and their targets can aid the understanding of regulatory processes. Recently, prediction methods based on machine learning have been widely used for miRNA prediction. However, most of these methods were designed for mammalian miRNA prediction, and few are available for predicting miRNAs in the pre-miRNAs of specific plant species. Although the complete Solanum lycopersicum genome has been published, only 77 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs have been identified, far less than the estimated number. Therefore, it is essential to develop a prediction method based on machine learning to identify new plant miRNAs. A novel classification model based on a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to identify real and pseudo plant pre-miRNAs together with their miRNAs. An initial set of 152 novel features related to sequential structures was used to train the model. By applying feature selection, we obtained the best subset of 47 features for use with the Back Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (B-SVM-RFE) method for the classification of plant pre-miRNAs. Using this method, 63 features were obtained for plant miRNA classification. We then developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, which comprises MiPlantPre and MiPlantMat, to identify plant pre-miRNAs and their miRNAs. This model achieved approximately 90% accuracy using plant datasets from nine plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens, Medicago truncatula, Sorghum bicolor, Arabidopsis lyrata, Zea mays and Solanum lycopersicum. Using miPlantPreMat, 522 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs were identified in the Solanum lycopersicum genome sequence. We developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, based on structure-sequence features and SVM. MiPlantPreMat was used to identify both plant pre-miRNAs and the corresponding mature miRNAs. An improved feature selection method was proposed, resulting in high classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,,15,,2014,2014-12-01 00:00:00,"Jun Meng, Dong Liu, Chao Sun, Yushi Luan","145365756, 2152508812, 2118133697, 144233098",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/363c760e9905ce5ebeb3bc2de5521cce24d2739b,"Biology, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Medicine",145365756,['JournalArticle'],33.0,41.0

Most computational tools labeled as miRNA predictors are in fact pre-miRNA predictors and provide no information about the putative miRNA location within the pre-miRNA. Sequence and structural features that determine the location of the miRNA, and the extent to which these properties vary from species to species, are poorly understood. We have developed miRdup, a computational predictor for the identification of the most likely miRNA location within a given pre-miRNA or the validation of a candidate miRNA. MiRdup is based on a random forest classifier trained with experimentally validated miRNAs from miRbase, with features that characterize the miRNA–miRNA* duplex. Because we observed that miRNAs have sequence and structural properties that differ between species, mostly in terms of duplex stability, we trained various clade-specific miRdup models and obtained increased accuracy. MiRdup self-trains on the most recent version of miRbase and is easy to use.

Traditional RNA function prediction methods rely on sequence or alignment information, which are limited in their abilities to classify the various collections of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). To address this, we developed Classification of RNAs by Analysis of Length (CoRAL), a machine learning-based approach for classification of RNA molecules. CoRAL uses biologically interpretable features including fragment length and cleavage specificity to distinguish between different ncRNA populations. We evaluated CoRAL using genome-wide small RNA sequencing data sets from four human tissue types and were able to classify six different types of RNAs with ∼80% cross-validation accuracy. Analysis by CoRAL revealed that microRNAs, small nucleolar and transposon-derived RNAs are highly discernible and consistent across all human tissue types assessed, whereas long intergenic ncRNAs, small cytoplasmic RNAs and small nuclear RNAs show less consistent patterns. The ability to reliably annotate loci across tissue types demonstrates the potential of CoRAL to characterize ncRNAs using small RNA sequencing data in less well-characterized organisms.",Nucleic Acids Research,journal,da96c220-cd39-4894-bae6-d2d77c8e7aa9,Nucleic Acids Research,e137 - e137,41,,2013,2013-05-21 00:00:00,"Y.

The sequence of a mature microRNA, especially the ‘seeding sequence’, largely determines its binding ability and specificity to target mRNAs. Therefore, methods that predict mature microRNA sequences with high accuracy will benefit the identification and characterization of novel microRNAs and their targets, and contribute to inferring the post-transcriptional regulation network at a genome scale. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed a method, MiRmat, to predict the mature microRNA sequence. MiRmat is essentially composed of two parts: the prediction of Drosha processing site and the identification of Dicer processing site. Based on the analysis of microRNAs from 12 species, we found that the patterns of free energy profiles are conserved among vertebrate microRNA hairpins. Therefore, we introduced in our method the free energy distribution pattern of the downstream part of pri-microRNA secondary structure and Random Forest algorithm to predict the mature microRNA sequence. Based on the evaluation on an independent test dataset from 10 vertebrates, MiRmat was shown to identify 77.8% of the Drosha processing sites and 92.8% of the Dicer sites within a deviation of 2 nt. In a more stringent evaluation by excluding the microRNAs sharing the same family between the training set and test set, MiRmat kept a rather well performance of 71.9% and 87.2% of the identification rate on the Drosha and Dicer site respectively, which represents the ability to deal with the novel microRNA family. MiRmat outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has a high degree of efficacy for the prediction of mature microRNA sequences of vertebrates. Conclusion MiRmat was developed for identifying microRNA mature sequence(s) by introducing the free energy distribution of RNA stem-loop structure and the Random Forest algorithm. We prove that MiRmat has better performance than the existing tools and is applicable among vertebrates.

Less is known about the presence of messenger RNA (mRNA). This report profiles the human circulating mRNA transcriptome in people with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to determine whether mRNA analytes can be used as biomarkers of liver disease. Using RNAseq and RT-qPCR, we investigate circulating mRNA in plasma from HCC and LC patients and demonstrate detection of transcripts representing more than 19,000 different protein coding genes. Remarkably, the circulating mRNA expression levels were similar from person to person over the 21 individuals whose samples were analyzed by RNAseq. Liver derived circulating transcripts such as albumin (ALB), apolipoprotein (APO) A1, A2 & H, serpin A1 & E1, ferritin light chain (FTL) and fibrinogen like 1 (FGL1) were significantly upregulated in HCC patient samples. Higher levels of some of these liver-specific transcripts in the plasma of HCC patients were confirmed by RT-qPCR in another cohort of 20 individuals. Several less abundant circulating transcripts associated with cancer were detected in most HCC samples, but not in healthy subjects. Liver specificity of circulating transcripts was confirmed by investigating their expression in HCC tumor and liver cancer cell lines. Liver specific mRNA sequences in the plasma were predominantly present outside circulating extracellular vesicles. Conclusions: The circulating “mRNA” transcriptome is remarkably consistent in diversity and expression from person to person. Detection of transcripts corresponding to disease selective polypeptides suggests the possibility that circulating mRNA can work as a biomarker analyte for cancer detection.",OncoTarget,journal,106ecc86-1801-4b36-a05c-d36db69a968c,Oncotarget,2216 - 2232,11,,2020,2020-06-09 00:00:00,"A.

Many targets of PARP-1/2-dependent PARylation are involved in the DNA damage response and hence, the loss of these proteins disrupts a wide range of biological processes, from DNA repair and epigenetics to telomere and centromere regulation. The central role of these PARPs in DNA metabolism in cancer cells has led to the development of PARP inhibitors as new cancer therapeutics, both as adjuvant treatment potentiating chemo-, radio-, and immuno-therapies and as monotherapy exploiting cancer-specific defects in DNA repair. However, a cancer is not just made up of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment also includes multiple other cell types, particularly stromal and immune cells. Interactions between these cells—cancerous and non-cancerous—are known to either favor or limit tumorigenesis. In recent years, an important role of PARP-1 and PARP-2 has been demonstrated in different aspects of the immune response, modulating both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is now emerging that PARP-1 and PARP-2 may not only impact cancer cell biology, but also modulate the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the immunomodulatory roles of PARP-1 and PARP-2 may provide invaluable clues to the rational development of more selective PARP-centered therapies which target both the cancer and its microenvironment.",Cancers,journal,d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,12,,2020,2020-02-01 00:00:00,"J.

Most patients present with advanced or metastatic HCC at diagnosis and face a dismal prognosis. Tyrosine kinases are the gold standard treatment for this disease but yield limited survival benefits. Immune checkpoint inhibitors that augment adaptive immunity have been tested in HCC. Complex interactions between tumor cells, lymphocytes and the tumor environment determine the efficacy of such immunotherapies. Innate immune mechanisms – known drivers of liver disease progression in pre-HCC conditions such as fibrosis or cirrhosis – may either support or counteract tumor-related immune activation. In this review, we will highlight current concepts of the role of the innate immune system in hepatocarcinogenesis and discuss their relevance for translation into clinics.",Hepatic Oncology,journal,4dcfdb60-0ee4-40e6-b8ad-111d5320e495,Hepatic Oncology,,7,,2020,2020-01-31 00:00:00,"C.

However, the popular tumor marker, AFP, lacks sensitivity although its specificity is high. Tissue biopsy is an invasive operation and may increase the risk of needle-track metastases. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. This study aims to determine whether levels of plasma HSP90α in HCC patients can be used as a cost-effective and simple test for the initial diagnosis of the disease. Plasma samples were collected from 659 HCC patients, 114 secondary hepatic carcinoma (SHC) patients, 28 hepatic hemangioma patients and 230 healthy donors. The levels of HSP90α were measured by ELISA. The levels of plasma HSP90α in HCC patients were significantly higher than in healthy donors and in patients with hepatic hemangioma or SHC (144.08 ± 4.98, 46.81 ± 1.11, 61.56 ± 8.20 and 111.96 ± 10.08 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.05 in all cases). The levels were associated with age (p = 0.001), BCLC stage (p < 0.001), levels of AFP (p < 0.001), tumor size (p < 0.001), tumor number (p < 0.001), PVTT (p < 0.001), EHM (p < 0.001) and Child-Pugh stage in the HCC cohort. In addition, the levels of plasma HSP90α showed an upward trend along with the progression of the BCLC stage. ROC curve analysis showed that compared to AFP (AUC 0.922, 95%CI 0.902–0.938) or HSP90α (AUC 0.836, 95%CI 0.810–0.860), the combination of HSP90α and AFP (AUC0.943, 95%CI 0.925–0.957) significantly improved the diagnostic efficiency for HCC patients. The results suggest that plasma Hsp90 α levels can be used as an initial diagnosis for patients with HCC in both rural and cosmopolitan settings.",BMC Cancer,journal,b482a99f-ef53-4694-aec6-32ad78e0d716,BMC Cancer,,20,,2020,2020-01-02 00:00:00,"Wene Wei, Mengshu Liu, Shu-Fang Ning, Jingshan Wei, Jianhong Zhong, Jilin Li, Zheng-min Cai, Litu Zhang","14593804, 2152974743, 12088474, 2004082531, 2114793867, 2481628, 89918987, 5877750",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6ec5ca3c6914c89dd2f59c1e1aeeb1f3e891da3f,Medicine,14593804,['JournalArticle'],35.0,28.0

With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as deep learning, the feature engineering phase can be completely avoided. Recently reported research studies in this direction show the performance of their algorithms with a biased training data, which limits their practical use in real-time situations. There is a compelling need to mitigate bias and evaluate these methods independently in order to arrive at a new enhanced method for effective zero-day malware detection. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper, first, evaluates the classical MLAs and deep learning architectures for malware detection, classification, and categorization using different public and private datasets. Second, we remove all the dataset bias removed in the experimental analysis by having different splits of the public and private datasets to train and test the model in a disjoint way using different timescales. Third, our major contribution is in proposing a novel image processing technique with optimal parameters for MLAs and deep learning architectures to arrive at an effective zero-day malware detection model. A comprehensive comparative study of our model demonstrates that our proposed deep learning architectures outperform classical MLAs. Our novelty in combining visualization and deep learning architectures for static, dynamic, and image processing-based hybrid approach applied in a big data environment is the first of its kind toward achieving robust intelligent zero-day malware detection. Overall, this paper paves way for an effective visual detection of malware using a scalable and hybrid deep learning framework for real-time deployments.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,46717-46738,7,,2019,2019-04-03 00:00:00,"R.

Therefore, it is of great importance and necessity to detect Android malware. In this paper, we present a combination method for Android malware detection based on the machine learning algorithm. First, we construct the control flow graph of the application to obtain API information. Based on the API information, we innovatively construct Boolean, frequency, and time-series data sets. Based on these three data sets, three detection models for Android malware detection regarding API calls, API frequency, and API sequence aspects are constructed. Ultimately, an ensemble model is constructed for conformity. We tested and compared the accuracy and stability of our detection models through a large number of experiments. The experiments were conducted on 10010 benign applications and 10683 malicious applications. The results show that our detection model achieves 98.98% detection precision and has high accuracy and stability.

It plays an important role in many natural language processing applications such as text summarization, question answering, machine translation, information retrieval, dialog systems, plagiarism detection, and query ranking. STS has been widely studied in the general English domain. However, there exists few resources for STS tasks in the clinical domain and in languages other than English, such as Japanese. Objective The objective of this study is to capture semantic similarity between Japanese clinical texts (Japanese clinical STS) by creating a Japanese dataset that is publicly available. Materials We created two datasets for Japanese clinical STS: (1) Japanese case reports (CR dataset) and (2) Japanese electronic medical records (EMR dataset). The CR dataset was created from publicly available case reports extracted from the CiNii database. The EMR dataset was created from Japanese electronic medical records. Methods We used an approach based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to capture the semantic similarity between the clinical domain texts. BERT is a popular approach for transfer learning and has been proven to be effective in achieving high accuracy for small datasets. We implemented two Japanese pretrained BERT models: a general Japanese BERT and a clinical Japanese BERT. The general Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese Wikipedia texts while the clinical Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese clinical texts. Results The BERT models performed well in capturing semantic similarity in our datasets. The general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT and achieved a high correlation with human score (0.904 in the CR dataset and 0.875 in the EMR dataset). It was unexpected that the general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT on clinical domain dataset. This could be due to the fact that the general Japanese BERT is pretrained on a wide range of texts compared with the clinical Japanese BERT.",Methods of Information in Medicine,journal,95f5bdab-1f05-4090-899f-3869a15b5707,Methods of Information in Medicine,e56 - e64,60,,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,"Faith W.

Many shared tasks and corpora for STS have been organized and curated in the general English domain; however, such resources are limited in the biomedical domain. In 2019, the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) challenge developed a comprehensive clinical STS dataset and organized a community effort to solicit state-of-the-art solutions for clinical STS. Objective This study presents our transformer-based clinical STS models developed during this challenge as well as new models we explored after the challenge. This project is part of the 2019 n2c2/Open Health NLP shared task on clinical STS. Methods In this study, we explored 3 transformer-based models for clinical STS: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, and Robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa). We examined transformer models pretrained using both general English text and clinical text. We also explored using a general English STS dataset as a supplementary corpus in addition to the clinical training set developed in this challenge. Furthermore, we investigated various ensemble methods to combine different transformer models. Results Our best submission based on the XLNet model achieved the third-best performance (Pearson correlation of 0.8864) in this challenge. After the challenge, we further explored other transformer models and improved the performance to 0.9065 using a RoBERTa model, which outperformed the best-performing system developed in this challenge (Pearson correlation of 0.9010). Conclusions This study demonstrated the efficiency of utilizing transformer-based models to measure semantic similarity for clinical text. Our models can be applied to clinical applications such as clinical text deduplication and summarization.",JMIR Medical Informatics,journal,dc6419f3-98b3-4718-bba0-6b6d6c3d192b,JMIR Medical Informatics,,8,,2020,2020-07-27 00:00:00,"Xi Yang, Xing He, Hansi Zhang, Yinghan Ma, J.

Methods Our study was designed using a case-control method. A total of 31 subjects with BA and 31 healthy subjects with matching basic information were examined using rsfMRI. We also calculated and obtained the dVMHC value between the cerebral cortexes. Results Compared with the normal control group, the dVMHC of the lingual gyrus (Ling) and the calcarine sulcus (CAL), which represented the visual network (VN), increased significantly in the asthma group, while the dVMHC of the medial superior frontal gyrus (MSFG), the anterior/middle/posterior cingulate gyrus (A/M/PCG), and the supplementary motor area (SMA) of the sensorimotor network decreased significantly in the asthma group. Conclusion This study showed that the ability of emotion regulation and the efficiency of visual and cognitive information processing in patients with BA was lower than in those in the HC group.

Here, we extend LNM by using a multimodal strategy, combining functional and structural networks from 1000 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. We apply multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a combination of motor and sensory tests. Results are two-fold. First, multimodal LNM reveals that the functional modality contributes more than the structural one in the prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, when looking at each modality individually, the performance of the structural networks strongly depended on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, thereby eliminating the effect that larger lesions generally produce more severe sensorimotor impairment. In contrast, functional networks provided similar performance regardless of whether or not the effect of lesion size was removed. Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of network modalities, and their corresponding influence on behavioral performance after brain injury.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,"A.

Brain network disruptions caused by stroke are potential biological determinants of PSD but their conclusive roles are unavailable. Our study aimed to identify the strategic structural disconnection (SDC) pattern for PSD at three months poststroke and assess the predictive value of SDC information. Our prospective cohort of 697 first-ever acute ischemic stroke patients were recruited from three hospitals in central China. Sociodemographic, clinical, psychological and neuroimaging data were collected at baseline and depression status was assessed at three months poststroke. Voxel-based disconnection-symptom mapping found that SDCs involving bilateral temporal white matter and posterior corpus callosum, as well as white matter next to bilateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, were associated with PSD. This PSD-specific SDC pattern was used to derive SDC scores for all participants. SDC score was an independent predictor of PSD after adjusting for all imaging and clinical-sociodemographic-psychological covariates (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07, 1.48; P  = 0.006). Split-half replication showed the stability and generalizability of above results. When added to the clinical-sociodemographic-psychological prediction model, SDC score significantly improved the model performance and ranked the highest in terms of predictor importance. In conclusion, a strategic SDC pattern involving multiple lobes bilaterally is identified for PSD at 3 months poststroke. The SDC score is an independent predictor of PSD and may improve the predictive performance of the clinical-sociodemographic-psychological prediction model, providing new evidence for the brain-behavior mechanism and biopsychosocial theory of PSD.",Translational Psychiatry,journal,18232e92-ef10-46fd-ad77-bb418dcd525d,Translational Psychiatry,,12,,2022,2022-11-03 00:00:00,"Chensheng Pan, Guo Li, Ping Jing, Guo-Chong Chen, Wenzhe Sun, Jinfeng Miao, Yanyan Wang, Yan Lan, Xiuli Qiu, Xin Zhao, Junhua Mei, Shanshan Huang, L.

This is achieved by combining a quadrupole-based transverse phase-space tomography with the adjustable streaking angle of a polarizable X-band transverse deflection structure. We demonstrate with detailed simulations that the method is able to reconstruct various complex phase-space distributions and that the quality of the reconstruction depends on the number of input projections. This method allows for the identification and visualization of previously unnoticed detailed features in the phase-space distribution and can thereby be used as a tool toward improving the performance of particle accelerators or performing more accurate simulation studies.

The technique has been used in the CLARA accelerator test facility at Daresbury Laboratory: results from the machine learning method are compared with those from a conventional tomography algorithm (algebraic reconstruction), applied to the same data. The use of machine learning allows reconstruction of the 4D phase space distribution of the beam to be carried out much more rapidly than using conventional tomography algorithms, and also enables the use of image compression to reduce signiﬁcantly the size of the data sets involved in the analysis. Results from the machine learning technique are at least as good as those from the algebraic reconstruction tomography in characterising the beam behaviour, in terms of the variation of the beam size in response to variation of the quadrupole strengths.",Physical Review Accelerators and Beams,journal,f0b25a48-865d-41bf-8487-1394ac41a63f,Physical Review Accelerators and Beams,,,,2022,2022-09-02 00:00:00,"A.

However, for time-varying systems, the predictive capabilities of ML tools degrade if the systems are no longer accurately represented by the data with which the ML models were trained. For complex systems, re-training is only possible if the changes are slow relative to the rate at which large numbers of new input-output training data can be non-invasively recorded. In this work, we present an approach to deep learning for time-varying systems that does not require re-training, but uses instead an adaptive feedback in the architecture of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The feedback is based only on available system output measurements and is applied in the encoded low-dimensional dense layers of the encoder-decoder CNNs. First, we develop an inverse model of a complex accelerator system to map output beam measurements to input beam distributions, while both the accelerator components and the unknown input beam distribution vary rapidly with time. We then demonstrate our method on experimental measurements of the input and output beam distributions of the HiRES ultra-fast electron diffraction (UED) beam line at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and showcase its ability for automatic tracking of the time varying photocathode quantum efficiency map. Our method can be successfully used to aid both physics and ML-based surrogate online models to provide non-invasive beam diagnostics.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,,2021,2021-09-28 00:00:00,"A.

The manual process of burn diagnosis is time-consuming and complex, even for experienced doctors. Machine learning (ML) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models have emerged as the standard for medical image diagnosis. The ML-based approach typically requires handcrafted features for training, which may result in suboptimal performance. Conversely, DL-based methods automatically extract features, but designing a robust model is challenging. Additionally, shallow DL methods lack long-range feature dependency, decreasing efficiency in various applications. We implemented several deep CNN models, ResNeXt, VGG16, and AlexNet, for human burn diagnosis. The results obtained from these models were found to be less reliable since shallow deep CNN models need improved attention modules to preserve the feature dependencies. Therefore, in the proposed study, the feature map is divided into several categories, and the channel dependencies between any two channel mappings within a given class are highlighted. A spatial attention map is built by considering the links between features and their locations. Our attention-based model BuRnGANeXt50 kernel and convolutional layers are also optimized for human burn diagnosis. The earlier study classified the burn based on depth of graft and non-graft. We first classified the burn based on the degree. Subsequently, it is classified into graft and non-graft. Furthermore, the proposed model performance is evaluated on Burns_BIP_US_database. The sensitivity of the BuRnGANeXt50 is 97.22% and 99.14%, respectively, for classifying burns based on degree and depth. This model may be used for quick screening of burn patients and can be executed in the cloud or on a local machine.

Contributing to this problem are change in burn appearance throughout the first week requiring periodic evaluation until a confident diagnosis can be made. To overcome these issues, we investigated the feasibility of an artificial intelligence algorithm trained with multispectral images of burn injuries to predict burn depth rapidly and accurately, including burns of indeterminate depth. In a feasibility study, 406 multispectral images of burns were collected within 72 hours of injury and then serially for up to 7 days. Simultaneously, the subject’s clinician indicated whether the burn was of indeterminate depth. The final depth of burned regions within images were agreed upon by a panel of burn practitioners using biopsies and 21-day healing assessments as reference standards. We compared three convolutional neural network architectures and an ensemble in their capability to automatically highlight areas of nonhealing burn regions within images. The top algorithm was the ensemble with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 97% positive predictive value (PPV). Its sensitivity and PPV were found to increase in a sigmoid shape during the first week postburn, with the inflection point at day 2.5. Additionally, when burns were labeled as indeterminate, the algorithm’s sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value were: 70%, 100%, 97%, and 100%. These results suggest multispectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence is feasible for detecting nonhealing burn tissue and could play an important role in aiding the earlier diagnosis of indeterminate burns.",Journal of Burn Care & Research,journal,ee38b919-df66-49ac-a082-bdbeaea54293,Journal of Burn Care & Research: Official Publication of the American Burn Association,969 - 981,44,,2023,2023-04-21 00:00:00,"Jeffrey E.

Automated image-based algorithms could assist in performing wound detection and classification. We aimed to develop two deep-learning algorithms that respectively identify burns, and classify whether they require surgery. An additional aim assessed the performances in different Fitzpatrick skin types. Annotated burn (n = 1105) and background (n = 536) images were collected. Using a commercially available platform for deep learning algorithms, two models were trained and validated on 70% of the images and tested on the remaining 30%. Accuracy was measured for each image using the percentage of wound area correctly identified and F1 scores for the wound identifier; and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity for the wound classifier. The wound identifier algorithm detected an average of 87.2% of the wound areas accurately in the test set. For the wound classifier algorithm, the AUC was 0.885. The wound identifier algorithm was more accurate in patients with darker skin types; the wound classifier was more accurate in patients with lighter skin types. To conclude, image-based algorithms can support the assessment of acute burns with relatively good accuracy although larger and different datasets are needed.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,,2023,2023-01-31 00:00:00,"C.

However, severe skin burns are highly dynamic and hard to predict. This results in a low accuracy rate of about 60 - 75% in the diagnosis of partial-thickness burns in the acute post-burn period. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has demonstrated a significant potential for non-invasive and timely estimation of the burn severity. Here, we describe a methodology for the measurement and numerical modeling of the dielectric permittivity of the in vivo porcine skin burns. We use the double Debye dielectric relaxation theory to model the permittivity of the burned tissue. We further investigate the origins of dielectric contrast between the burns of various severity, as determined histologically based on the percentage of the burned dermis, using the empirical Debye parameters. We demonstrate that the five parameters of the double Debye model can form an artificial neural network classification algorithm capable of automatic diagnosis of the severity of the burn injuries, and predicting its ultimate wound healing outcome by forecasting its re-epithelialization status in 28 days. Our results demonstrate that the Debye dielectric parameters provide a physics-based approach for the extraction of the biomedical diagnostic markers from the broadband THz pulses. This method can significantly boost dimensionality reduction of THz training data in artificial intelligence models and streamline machine learning algorithms.",Biomedical Optics Express,journal,7e331686-6620-4481-a3d5-5effffe9ab83,Biomedical optics express,"

Wearable biosensors have been widely applied in, among others, biometrics, sports, health care, rehabilitation assistance, and edutainment. Continuous data collection from biodevices provides a valuable volume of information, which needs to be curated and prepared before serving machine learning applications. One of the universal preparation steps is data segmentation and labelling/annotation. This work proposes a practical and manageable way to automatically segment and label single-channel or multimodal biosignal data using a self-similarity matrix (SSM) computed with signals’ feature-based representation. Applied to public biosignal datasets and a benchmark for change point detection, the proposed approach delivered lucid visual support in interpreting the biosignals with the SSM while performing accurate automatic segmentation of biosignals with the help of the novelty function and associating the segments grounded on their similarity measures with the similarity profiles. The proposed method performed superior to other algorithms in most cases of a series of automatic biosignal segmentation tasks; of equal appeal is that it provides an intuitive visualization for information retrieval of multimodal biosignals.",Biosensors,journal,fe3b42b8-4af0-4a32-870f-e07da5a91be7,Biosensors,,12,,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,"João Rodrigues, Hui Liu, Duarte Folgado, David Belo, Tanja Schultz, Hugo Gamboa","152794065, 2146672447, 50816880, 3333688, 2134361463, 2161060249",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c824d095fbf7d9afdde8c36909fc70eb569f15c3,"Biology, Computer Science, Medicine",152794065,['JournalArticle'],33.0,97.0

A total of 250 Taiwanese adults (total group, TOG) aged 22-64 years participated in this study, and were stratified into a normal group (NOG: 135), an overweight group (OVG: 69), and an obesity group (OBG: 46), according to the BMI classification recommended by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare. VO2max was directly measured on an electromagnetic bicycle ergometer. Using the participant's heart rate in the 3-min incremental step-in-place test and demographic parameters, VO2max prediction models established for four groups were TOG model, NOG model, OVG model, and OBG model, respectively. Compared with the TOG model, the OVG and OBG models had higher coefficients of determination and lower standard error of estimates (SEEs), or %SEEs. The validities of the NOG (r = 0.780), OVG (r = 0.776), and OBG (r = 0.791) models for BMI subgroups increased by 1.79%, 4.64%, and 8.22% respectively, and the reliabilities (NOG model: ICC = 0.755; OVG model: ICC = 0.765; OBG model: ICC = 0.779) increased by 3.18%, 3.27%, and 9.63%, respectively. These results suggested using separate models established in BMI stratifications can effectively improve the prediction of VO2max.",International Journal of Medical Sciences,journal,066cdb7e-e208-48f2-a573-c3638ce71926,International Journal of Medical Sciences,1929 - 1941,19,,2022,2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Fang Li, Cheng-Pang Yang, Cheng-You Wu, Chia-An Ho, Hung-Chih Yeh, Yuan-Shuo Chan, Wen-Sheng ChangChien, Chin-Shan Ho","2146328975, 35340512, 2151102932, 2149653880, 145485683, 4881470, 2134140687, 2256144995",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/053ce79596ea7bdcf63776c642e94f444cb3f97e,Medicine,2146328975,['JournalArticle'],4.0,52.0

However, the methodology underlying machine learning in spine research is often overlooked as the subject matter is quite novel and may be foreign to practicing spine surgeons. Improper application of machine learning is a significant bioethics challenge, given the potential consequences of over- or underestimating the results of such studies for clinical decision-making processes. Proper peer review of these publications requires a baseline familiarity of the language associated with machine learning, and how it differs from classical statistical analyses. This narrative review first introduces the overall field of machine learning and its role in artificial intelligence, and defines basic terminology. In addition, common modalities for applying machine learning, including classification and regression decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are examined in the context of examples gathered from the spine literature. Lastly, the ethical challenges associated with adapting machine learning for research related to patient care, as well as future perspectives on the potential use of machine learning in spine surgery, are discussed specifically.",Frontiers in Surgery,journal,20f49295-6ad9-4d39-ac66-a41cd69f0e19,Frontiers in Surgery,,7,,2020,2020-08-21 00:00:00,"Michael Chang, J.

Surgical correction has proven to be effective in achieving improvement of spinopelvic parameters as well as improving quality of life (QoL) for these patients. However, given the relatively high complication risk associated with ASD correction, it is of paramount importance to develop robust prognostic tools for predicting risk profile and outcomes. Historically, statistical models such as linear and logistic regression models were used to identify preoperative factors associated with postoperative outcomes. While these tools were useful for looking at simple associations, they represent generalizations across large populations, with little applicability to individual patients. More recently, predictive analytics utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning for comprehensive processing of large amounts of data have become available for surgeons to implement. The use of these computational techniques has given surgeons the ability to leverage far more accurate and individualized predictive tools to better inform individual patients regarding predicted outcomes after ASD correction surgery. Applications range from predicting QoL measures to predicting the risk of major complications, hospital readmission, and reoperation rates. In addition, AI has been used to create a novel classification system for ASD patients, which will help surgeons identify distinct patient subpopulations with unique risk-benefit profiles. Overall, these tools will help surgeons tailor their clinical practice to address patients’ individual needs and create an opportunity for personalized medicine within spine surgery.",Neurospine,journal,b38d49f5-9e0d-4cd6-a080-adda18e0ae37,Neurospine,686 - 694,16,,2019,2019-12-01 00:00:00,"Rushikesh S.

A central question of GPCR drug discovery is to understand what determines the agonism or antagonism of ligands which bind them. Ligands exert their action via the interactions in the ligand binding pocket. We hypothesised that there is a common set of receptor interactions made by ligands of diverse structures that mediate their action and that among a large dataset of different ligands, the functionally important interactions will be over-represented. We computationally docked ~2700 known β2AR ligands to multiple β2AR structures, generating ca 75,000 docking poses and predicted all atomic interactions between the receptor and the ligand. We used machine learning (ML) techniques to identify specific interactions that correlate with the agonist or antagonist activity of these ligands. The interpretation of ML analysis in human understandable form allowed us to construct an exquisitely detailed structure-activity relationship that identifies small changes to the ligands that invert their activity and thus helps to guide the drug discovery process.

SATs have been found to be closely related to obesity and obesity-induced metabolic disease. Some studies have shown a significant association between subcutaneous fat metabolism and sexes. However, the molecular mechanisms for this association are still unclear. Here, using the pig as a model, we investigated the systematic association between the subcutaneous fat metabolism and sexes, and identified some key sex-specific pathways and genes in the SATs from pigs. Results The results revealed that 134 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in female and male pigs from the obese group. A total of 17 coexpression modules were detected, of which six modules were significantly correlated with the sexes ( P  < 0.01). Among the significant modules, the greenyellow module (cor = 0.68, P  < 9e-06) and green module (cor = 0.49, P  < 0.003) were most significantly positively correlated with the male and female, respectively. Functional analysis showed that one GO term and four KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the greenyellow module while six GO terms and six KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the green module. Furthermore, a total of five and two key sex-specific genes were identified in the two modules, respectively. Two key sex-specific pathways (Ras-MAPK signaling pathway and type I interferon response) play an important role in the SATs of males and females, respectively. Conclusions The present study identified some key sex-specific pathways and genes in the SATs from pigs, which provided some new insights into the molecular mechanism of being involved in fat formation and immunoregulation between pigs of different sexes.

Thus, ACAA1 is an important regulator of lipid metabolism and plays an essential role in fatty acid oxidation and lipid metabolism. Our previous study findings revealed that ACAA1 is closely associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and fatty acid metabolism pathways, which are involved in fat deposition in sheep, leading to our hypothesis that ACAA1 may be involved in fat deposition by regulating lipid metabolism. However, the associated molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, to assess the potential function of ACAA1 in sheep preadipocyte differentiation, we knocked down and overexpressed ACAA1 in sheep preadipocytes and evaluated the pattern of ACAA1 gene expression during preadipocyte differentiation by qRT-PCR. ACAA1 was significantly expressed in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, and then its expression decreased. ACAA1 deficiency increased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content and promoted sheep preadipocyte differentiation, whereas ACAA1 overexpression inhibited adipogenesis and decreased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content. Simultaneously, we demonstrated that ACAA1 deficiency upregulated the expressions of the adipogenic marker genes PPARγ and C/EBPα in sheep preadipocytes, but ACAA1 overexpression inhibited the expressions of these markers, indicating that ACAA1 affects lipid metabolism by regulating adipogenic marker genes. Our results may promote a better understanding of the regulation of adipogenesis by ACAA1.",Frontiers in Genetics,journal,9ec189b3-db0f-41d8-9c82-21ef5fa9b87e,Frontiers in Genetics,,12,,2021,2021-06-21 00:00:00,"Yanli Wang, Xin Li, Yang Cao, C.

We evaluated the associations between novel biomarkers and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) for predicting clinical HCC outcomes, hub-related genes, pathway regulation, and immune cells infiltration. Bioinformatic analyses based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were performed using online analysis tools. RBP4 expression was low in HCC and was also down-regulated in pan-cancers compared with normal tissues. RBP4 expression was also significantly different based on age (41–60 years old versus 61–80 years old), and low RBP4 expression levels were associated with advanced tumor stages and grades. Higher RBP4 expression was associated with better overall survival time in HCC patients, and we identified a deletion-mutation rate of 1.4% in RBP4. We also identified ten co-expressed genes most related to RBP4 and explored the relationships between six hub genes (APOB, FGA, FGG, SERPINC1, APOA1, and F2) involved in RBP4 regulation. A pathway enrichment analysis for RBP4 indicated complement and coagulation cascades, metabolic pathways, antibiotic biosynthesis pathways, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways, and pyruvate metabolism pathways. These results suggest that RBP4 may be a novel biomarker for HCC prognosis, and an indicator of low immune response to the disease.",Bioscience Reports,journal,678ce279-560b-4a6c-af55-ff68d5c2b544,Bioscience Reports,,41,,2021,2021-04-01 00:00:00,"Mingxing Li, Zhihui Wang, Lixu Zhu, Yifang Shui, Shuijun Zhang, Wenzhi Guo","2112131095, 2108347004, 2280044871, 46841412, 1492026881, 8513790",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed80ac70e664ea683edbca0a30300b8666592a2b,Medicine,2112131095,['JournalArticle'],17.0,43.0

In this study, the Longissimus dorsi muscle tissues were collected from five Liaoning cashmere (LC) goats and five Ziwuling black (ZB) goats with phenotypic difference in carcass weight, some meat quality traits and muscle components. The histological quantitative of collagen fibers and the transcriptome profiles in the Longissimus dorsi muscle tissues were investigated using Masson-trichrome staining and RNA-Seq, respectively. The percentage of total collagen fibers in the Longissimus dorsi muscle tissues from ZB goats was less than those from LC goats, suggesting that these ZB goats had more tender meat. An average of 15,919 and 15,582 genes were found to be expressed in Longissimus dorsi muscle tissues from LC and ZB goats, respectively. Compared to LC goats, the expression levels of 78 genes were up-regulated in ZB goats, while 133 genes were down-regulated. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in GO terms related to the muscle growth and development and the deposition of intramuscular fat and lipid metabolism, hippo signaling pathway and Jak-STAT signaling pathway.

We enhance our method by incorporating deep learning techniques and multi-modal imaging data, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) images alongside fundus photographs, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of retinal pathology. The advanced EDL integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms with Capsule Networks (CapsNet) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for more nuanced feature extraction and classification. We introduce a novel ensemble adaptive weighting approach that dynamically adjusts classifier weights based on performance across disease types and severity levels, significantly improving the algorithm's handling of complex and rare cases. To enhance model interpretability, we implement an explainable AI component that provides visual heatmaps of the most significant regions for each diagnosis to clinicians. We evaluate the enhanced EDL on a large, diverse dataset encompassing multiple retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma, across various ethnicities and age groups. Our results demonstrate superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to our previous model and other state-of-the-art approaches.

Previous work in cyber bullying detection is often confronted with limitations in accurately detecting abusive behavior because of the intricacies in cyber space and evolution of cyber bullying practices. A new approach of Cyber bullying detection and classification network (CBDC- Net) for improving the effectiveness of detection of cyber bullying in OSNs based on natural language processing features, feature selection techniques, and deep learning algorithms is also presented in this study. CBDC-Net can overcome these challenges to existing detection methods of cyber bullying using innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning approaches. In the data preprocessing step, CBDC-Net filter and normalize the text data that is openly collected from OSNs. After that, CBDC-Net extracts features using a Synonym Level N-Gram (SLNG) approach and it incorporates both the word and character-based information to make the synonyms of text much better than the other method. After that, CSI of CBDC-Net applied Textual Similarity Resilient Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (TSR-SCSO) for feature selection to give an iterative value of their features’ importance level to detect cyber bullying. Last, in CBDC-Net, a Recurrent Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)Neural Network for classification (RBLNN) is used as classification approach is applied, which recognizes the sequential nature of textual data enabling proper distinction between cyber bullying cases.

Video Analytics for human action recognition is given significance due to its utility. However, it is very challenging to analyze live-streaming videos to identify human actions across the frames in the video. The literature showed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among computer vision applications' most popular deep learning algorithms. Another important observation is that Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) architecture with deep learning has the potential to leverage effectiveness in applications using computer vision. Inspired by this finding, we created a GAN-based framework (called HARGAN) in this research for human activity identification from surveillance films. The framework exploits a retrained deep learning model known as ResNet50 and convolutional LSTM for better performance in action recognition. Our framework has two critical functionalities: feature learning and human action recognition. The ResNet50 model achieves the former, while the GAN-based convolutional LSTM model achieves the latter. We proposed an algorithm called the Generative Adversarial Approach for Human Action Recognition (GAA-HAR) to realize the framework. We used a benchmark dataset known as UCF50, which is extensively used in studies on human action identification. Based on our experimental findings, the suggested framework performs better than the current baseline models like CNN, LSTM, and convolutional LSTM, with the highest accuracy of 97.73%.

The inherent diversity within IoT networks renders them suitable for a myriad of real-time applications, firmly embedding them into the fabric of daily life. While IoT devices streamline various activities, their susceptibility to security threats is a glaring concern. Current inadequacies in security measures render IoT networks vulnerable, presenting an enticing target for attackers.

Inspired by the benefits of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), we introduce the Genetic Bee LSTM(GBLSTM) networks for the development of intelligent IDS capable of detecting a wide range of cyber-attacks targeting IoT area. The methodology comprises four key execution: (i) collection of unit for profiling normal IoT device behavior, (ii) Identification of malicious devices during an attack, (iii) Prediction of attack types implemented in the network. Intensive experimentations of the suggested IDS are conducted using various validation methods and prominent metrics across different IoT threat scenarios. Moreover, comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the suggested models alongside existing learning models. The results demonstrate that the GBLSTM-models outperform other intellectual models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, underscoring their efficacy in securing IoT networks.",International Journal of Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering,journal,d705229b-efc0-49f4-b9ad-3d19de4bb02f,International Journal of Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering,,,,2024,2024-11-26 00:00:00,"P.

Both people and objects may be identified using the Machine learning technique. It is particularly important in the verification process since it recognizes the characteristics of human eyes, fingerprints, and facial patterns. With the advanced technology developments, nowadays, Facial recognition is used as one of the authentication processes by utilizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms and it has been the subject of several academic studies.  These algorithms performed well on faces without masks, but not well on faces with masks. since the masks obscured the preponderance of the facial features. As a result, an improved algorithm for facial identification with and without masks is required. After the Covid-19 breakout, deep learning algorithms were utilized in research to recognize faces wearing masks. Those algorithms, however, were trained on both mask- and mask-free faces. Hence, in this, the cropped region for the faces is only used for facial recognition. Here, the features were extracted using the texture features, and the best-optimized features from the glow worm optimization algorithm are used in this paper. With these features set, the hybrid Dolphin glow worm optimization is used for finding the optimal features and spread function value for the neural network. The regression neural network is trained with the optimized feature set and spread function for the face recognition task. The performance of the suggested method will be compared to that of known approaches such as CNN-GSO and CNN for face recognition with and without masks using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity will next be examined.",International Journal of Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering,journal,d705229b-efc0-49f4-b9ad-3d19de4bb02f,International Journal of Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering,,,,2024,2024-11-16 00:00:00,"Naresh Babu Kosuri, Suneetha Manne","2331315941, 3023162",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8be5972ab997df92326e0b58486a9ddf86e52cc2,Computer Science,2331315941,['JournalArticle'],13.0,18.0

Most machine detection methods are constrained by congenital observations, although computers have been utilized in several recent research studies to diagnose AD. In AD, the hippocampus is usually the first part of the brain to be affected. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (SMRI) can be used to assist in diagnosing AD by measuring the hippocampus’s form and volume (MRI). The information encoded by these attributes is restricted and may be affected by segmentation problems. These traits are also extracted independently of the classification, which could result in lower-than-desired classification accuracy. Researchers in this study used structural MRI data to develop a deep learning framework for combined automatic hippocampus segmentation and AD categorization. Multi-task deep learning (MTDL) is used to learn hippocampus segmentation simultaneously. The hyperparameter optimization of the CNN model (capsule network) for illness classification is then carried out using the deer hunting optimization (DHO) technique. ADNI-standardized MRI datasets have been used to test the suggested method, and it is accurate. Suggested MTDL achieved 97.1% accuracy and 93.5% of Dice coefficient, whereas the proposed MTDL model achieved an accuracy of 96% for binary classification and 93% for multi-class classification.",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,journal,6401bb05-050b-4beb-8824-066cb2938eb4,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,,,2023,2023-06-06 00:00:00,"S.

Devices can minimize interference and optimize bandwidth usage by using directional antennas and by avoiding overlapping communication ranges. In addition, devices need to carefully manage their use of resources, such as bandwidth and energy. Bandwidth is limited in wireless personal area networks (WPANs), so devices need to carefully select which data to send and receive. In this paper, an intelligent performance analysis of energy‐efficient resource optimization model has been proposed for device‐to‐device (D2D) communication in fifth‐generation (5G) WPAN. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation in D2D communication is important because it helps reduce energy consumption and extend the lifespan of devices that are communicating with each other. By allocating resources in an efficient manner, communication between two devices can be optimized for maximum efficiency. This helps reduce the amount of energy needed to power the communication, as well as the amount of energy needed to power the device that is communicating with another device. Additionally, efficient resource allocation helps reduce the overall cost of communication, as the use of fewer resources results in a lower overall cost. The proposed efficient resource allocation helps reduce the environmental impact of communication, as less energy is used for communication. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation model (EERAM) has reached 92.97% of energy allocation, 88.72% of power allocation, 87.79% of bandwidth allocation, 87.93% of spectrum allocation, 88.43% of channel allocation, 25.47% of end‐to‐end delay, 94.33% of network data speed, and 90.99% of network throughput.",International Journal of Communication Systems,journal,657efb9d-473f-4e6b-b416-eaa71d96e4dd,International Journal of Communication Systems,,36,,2023,2023-05-22 00:00:00,"J.

Therefore, countless artificial intelligence applications can be seen in the medical domain at various levels, which are employed to enhance early diagnosis and prediction and reduce the risks associated with many diseases, including heart diseases. In this article, machine learning techniques (logistic regression, random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors) are utilized to diagnose heart disease from the Cleveland Clinic dataset got from the University of California Irvine machine learning (UCL) repository and Kaggle platform then create a comparison between the performance of these techniques. In addition, some literature related to machine learning and deep learning techniques that aim to provide reasonable solutions in monitoring, detecting, diagnosing, and predicting heart disease and how these technologies assist in making health decisions are reviewed. Ten studies are selected and summarized by the authors published between 2017 and 2022 are illustrated. After executing a series of tests, it is seen that the most profitable performance in diagnosing heart disease is the support vector machines, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96%.

The need to explore possible ways to tackle the disease necessitated this study. The study designed a machine learning model for cardiovascular disease risk prediction in accordance with a dataset that contains 11 features which may be used to forecast the disease. The dataset from Kaggle on cardiovascular disease includes approximately 70,000 patient records that were used to determine the outcome. Compared to the UCI dataset, the Kaggle dataset has many more training and validation records. Models created using neural networks, random forests, Bayesian networks, C5.0, and QUEST were compared for this dataset. On training and testing data sets, the results acquired a high accuracy (99.1 percent), which is significantly superior to previous methods.

People have been experimenting with techniques to extend their lives since ancient times. Despite this, technology is still a long way from attaining the aim of lowering mortality rates. Methods From methodological perspective, a design Science Research (DSR) approach is adopted in this research. As such, to investigate the current healthcare and interaction systems created for predicting cardiac disease for patients, we first analyzed the body of existing literature. After that, a conceptual framework of the system was designed using the gathered requirements. Based on the conceptual framework, the development of different components of the system was completed. Finally, the evaluation study procedure was developed taking into account the effectiveness, usability and efficiency of the developed system. Results To attain the objectives, we proposed a system consisting of a wearable device and mobile application, which allows the users to know their risk levels of having CVDs in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques were adopted to develop the system that can classify its users into three risk levels (high, moderate and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 80.4% and two risk levels (high and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 91%. The stacking classifier incorporating best-performing ML algorithms was used for predicting the risk levels of the end-users utilizing the UCI Repository dataset. Conclusion The resultant system allows the users to check and monitor their possibility of having CVD in near future using real-time data. Also, the system was evaluated from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) point of view. Thus, the created system offers a promising resolution to the current biomedical sector.

Manual logging of drill holes can be difficult to exploit as the results may not be comparable between holes due to the subjective nature of geological logging. Exploration and mining companies commonly collect geochemical or mineralogical data from diamond drill core or drill chips; however, manual interpretation of multivariate data can be slow and challenging; therefore, automation of any of the steps in the interpretation process would be valuable. Hyperspectral analysis of drill chips provides a relatively inexpensive method of collecting very detailed information rapidly and consistently. However, the challenge of such data is the high dimensionality of the data’s variables in comparison to the number of samples. Hyperspectral data is usually processed to produce mineral abundances generally involving a range of assumptions. This paper presents the results of testing a new fast and objective methodology to identify the lithological boundaries from high dimensional hyperspectral data. This method applies a quadrant scan analysis to recurrence plots. The results, applied to nickel laterite deposits from New Caledonia, demonstrate that this method can identify transitions in the downhole data. These are interpreted as reflecting mineralogical changes that can be used as an aid in geological logging to improve boundary detection.",Minerals,journal,05479075-64ee-4b95-b9a7-023afff1b556,Minerals,,,,2021,2021-12-29 00:00:00,"Ayham A.

However, large multi-element data sets are slow and challenging to interpret without using some form of automated analysis, such as mathematical, statistical or machine learning techniques. Automated analysis techniques also have the advantage in that they are repeatable and can provide consistent results, even for very large data sets. In this paper, an automated litho-geochemical interpretation workflow is demonstrated, which includes data exploration and data preparation using appropriate compositional data-analysis techniques. Multiscale analysis using a modified wavelet tessellation has been applied to the data to provide coherent geological domains. Unsupervised machine learning (clustering) has been used to provide a first-pass classification. The results are compared with the detailed geologist’s logs. The comparison shows how the integration of automated analysis of geochemical data can be used to enhance traditional geological logging and demonstrates the identification of new geological units from the automated litho-geochemical logging that were not apparent from visual logging but are geochemically distinct. KEY POINTS To reduce computational complexity and facilitate interpretation, a subset of geochemical elements is selected, and then a centred log-ratio transform is applied. The wavelet tessellation method is used to domain the drill holes into rock units at a range of scales. Several clustering methods were tested to identify distinct rock units in the samples and multiscale domains for classification.

Kaolinite is present within 2 km of the mineralized centers but does not necessarily occur within strongly mineralized intervals. Prehnite is ubiquitous from 4 to 8 km from the deposits. In the Bethlehem deposit, tourmaline and epidote are associated with mineralization. We propose a spectral alteration score based on these proximal hyperspectral SWIR mineralogical patterns to assist explorers in targeting porphyry Cu systems when using drill core, surface rock samples and potentially remote sensing imagery. In a production environment, this metric could serve to facilitate ore-sorting.",Minerals,journal,05479075-64ee-4b95-b9a7-023afff1b556,Minerals,,,,2020,2020-05-23 00:00:00,"P. Lypaczewski, B.

Automated or semi-automated interpretation of numerical drill hole data is required to reduce time and subjectivity of this process. However, results from machine learning algorithms applied to drill holes, without reference to spatial information, typically result in numerous small-scale units. These small-scale units result not only from the presence of very small rock units, which may be below the scale of interest, but also from misclassification. A novel method is proposed that uses the continuous wavelet transform to identify geological boundaries and uses wavelet coefficients to indicate boundary strength. The wavelet coefficient is a useful measure of boundary strength because it reflects both wavelength and amplitude of features in the signal. This means that boundary strength is an indicator of the apparent thickness of geological units and the amount of change occurring at each geological boundary. For multivariate data, boundaries from multiple variables are combined and multiscale domains are calculated using the combined boundary strengths. The method is demonstrated using multi-element geochemical data from mineral exploration drill holes. The method is fast, reduces misclassification, provides a choice of scales of interpretation and results in hierarchical classification for large scales where domains may contain more than one rock type.",Mathematical Geosciences,journal,1f92bb34-5c40-4f63-96fd-95b66eafdcb0,Mathematical Geosciences,21-53,53,,2020,2020-03-11 00:00:00,"E.

This interpretation method uses readily available distributed 3D data at the most relevant scale for mining and exploration. This method does not depend on collecting traditional structural data from core, such as orientation of planar and linear data, but relies on the premise that grade distributions sampled from drilling provide insight into the structural control of the deposit, with the interpretation of structural geometry done using a computer 3D viewer. This method is applied to the well-studied Archean Sigma-Lamaque gold deposit, which features late-orogenic vein mineralization, and which is controlled by three orders of structural features. The first-order control is the easterly plunging pipe-like conduit parallel to F 2 fold plunge defined by the intersection of bedding (S 0 ) and foliation (S 2 ) (~ 1.5 km radius × 3 km down-plunge). The second-order controls, nested within the first-order, are the younger subvertical Late Diorite plugs that intruded vertically into the host rocks along the established S 2 foliation anisotropy (1250:400:150 m dimension for Main Plug). The third-order control, laterally limited by first- and second-order structural controls, is the well-documented gold-bearing vein sets (1–10 m thick and up to 1.5 km in extent) that developed in the Late Diorites and in the older folded volcanogenic stratigraphy and diorites. It is proposed that the first-order control defined by the moderately plunging F 2 fold is the main fluid pathway resulting from structural permeability formed during earlier folding. The second-order Late Diorite plugs and other competent lithological units, which intersected and fractured during late-stage D 2 compression, served as chemically reactive sites causing gold to precipitate along this first-order pathway. It is predicted that intrusions that do not intersect the first-order structural conduits are less likely to be mineralized. Greenfield orogenic-gold exploration requires that the first-order controls are identified, and the geometry of hydrothermal alteration is best understood in the context of the structural architecture of the host rocks.",Mineralium Deposita,journal,c968effb-ab79-45ac-bf25-9e428a8537ac,Mineralium Deposita,217-240,55,,2020,2020-01-27 00:00:00,E.

In this paper, a methodology to integrate mineralogical and structural data extracted from hyperspectral drill-core scans is proposed. The workflow allows for the identification of vein types based on minerals having significant absorption features in the short-wave infrared. The method not only targets alteration halos of known compositions but also allows for the identification of any vein-like structure. The results consist of vein distribution maps, quantified vein abundances, and their azimuths. Three drill-cores from the Bolcana porphyry system hosting veins of variable density, composition, orientation, and thickness are analysed for this purpose. The results are validated using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy-based mineral mapping techniques. We demonstrate that the use of hyperspectral scanning allows for faster, non-invasive and more efficient drill-core mapping, providing a useful tool for complementing core-logging performed by on-site geologists.",Minerals,journal,05479075-64ee-4b95-b9a7-023afff1b556,Minerals,,,,2019,2019-02-19 00:00:00,"Laura Tusa, L.

One important step in the area of manufacturing is feature recognition that aims to detect all the machining features from a 3-D model. In this research area, recognizing and locating a wide variety of highly intersecting features are extremely challenging as the topology information of features is substantially damaged because of the feature intersection. Motivated by the single shot multibox detector (SSD), this article presents a novel deep learning approach named SsdNet to tackle the machining feature localization and recognition problem. The typical SSD is designed for 2-D image objection detection rather than 3-D feature recognition. Therefore, the network architecture and output of SSD are modified to fulfil the purpose of this research. In addition, some advanced techniques are also utilized to further enhance the recognition performance. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art feature recognition performance (95.20% F-score), localization performance (90.62% F-score), and recognition efficiency (243.85 ms per model).",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,journal,2135230a-3b24-4b71-9583-60624389377a,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,3292-3302,17,,2021,2021-05-01 00:00:00,"Peizhi Shi, Q.

In general, traditional rule-based feature recognition methods are computationally expensive, and dependent on surface or feature types. In addition, it is quite challenging to design proper rules to recognise intersecting features. Recently, a learning-based method, named FeatureNet, has been proposed for both single and multi-feature recognition. This is a general purpose algorithm which is capable of dealing with any type of features and surfaces. However, thousands of annotated training samples for each feature are required for training to achieve a high single feature recognition accuracy, which makes this technique difficult to use in practice. In addition, experimental results suggest that multi-feature recognition part in this approach works very well on intersecting features with small overlapping areas, but may fail when recognising highly intersecting features. To address the above issues, a deep learning framework based on multiple sectional view (MSV) representation named MsvNet is proposed for feature recognition. In the MsvNet, MSVs of a 3D model are collected as the input of the deep network, and the information achieved from different views are combined via the neural network for recognition. In addition to MSV representation, some advanced learning strategies (e.g. transfer learning, data augmentation) are also employed to minimise the number of training samples and training time. For multi-feature recognition, a novel view-based feature segmentation and recognition algorithm is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve the state-of-the-art single feature performance on the FeatureNet dataset with only a very small number of training samples (e.g. 8–32 samples for each feature), and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based multi-feature recognition method in terms of recognition performances.",Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,journal,9c5296b3-9225-4538-9b2d-f8f178534aad,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,1291 - 1309,31,,2020,2020-01-22 00:00:00,"Peizhi Shi, Q.

Recent literature highlights the increasing attention towards WQI based on water pollution index (WPI) and GWQI as essential tools for simplifying complex hydrogeological data, thereby facilitating effective groundwater management and protection. Unlike previous works, the present research introduces a novel hybrid method that integrates non-parametric kernel Gaussian learning (GPR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and decision tree (DT) algorithms. This approach marks the first application of a non-parametric kernel for groundwater quality pollution index prediction in Saudi Arabia, offering a significant advancement in the field. Through laboratory analysis and the combination of various machine learning (ML) techniques, this study enhances prediction capabilities, particularly for unmonitored sites in arid and semi-arid regions. The study’s objectives include feature engineering based on dependency sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential variables affecting WQI and GWQI, and the development of predictive models using ANFIS, GPR, and DT for both indices. Furthermore, it aims to assess the impact of different data portions on WQI and GWQI predictions, exploring data divisions such as (70% / 30%), (60% / 40%), and (80% / 20%) for training and testing phase, respectively. By filling a critical gap in water resource management, this research offers significant implications for the prediction of water quality in regions facing similar environmental challenges. Through its innovative methodology and comprehensive analysis, this study contributes to the broader effort of managing and protecting water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. The result proved that GPR-M1 exhibited exceptional testing phase accuracy with RMSE = 0.0169 for GWQI. Similarly, for WPI, the ANFIS-M1 achieved high testing predictive skills with RMSE = 0.0401.

Language identification (“LI”) is the problem of determining the natural language that a document or part thereof is written in. Automatic LI has been extensively researched for over fifty years. Today, LI is a key part of many text processing pipelines, as text processing techniques generally assume that the language of the input text is known. Research in this area has recently been especially active. This article provides a brief history of LI research, and an extensive survey of the features and methods used in the LI literature. We describe the features and methods using a unified notation, to make the relationships between methods clearer. We discuss evaluation methods, applications of LI, as well as off-the-shelfLI systems that do not require training by the end user. Finally, we identify open issues, survey the work to date on each issue, and propose future directions for research in LI.

Each type of bark made by dogs has a distinct context. The classification of dog bark pattern will aid in the understanding of barking action. In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used to analyze the pattern of barking from two different dog species: Rajapalayam Hound and Kombai Hound. The objective is to find the context of the dog barking pattern based on various real-time scenarios, including whether the dogs are alone, looking at strangers, or showing an eagerness to fight. The barks of the dogs were recorded inside the house under different scenarios, such as while identifying the owner or strangers. Machine learning algorithms, such as the reinforcement learning method, were used in predicting and classifying the dog sounds. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning that will generate the next best action for the given state. It is a model-free learning used to find the best course of dog action for the given current state of the dog. The Q-learning algorithm had been used in improving the prediction of dog sounds by updating the values of learning, where the values with the highest reward were taken into consideration. In total, 6171 barks were collected from the dogs chosen for study, and the proposed approach achieved a correct prediction accuracy of 85.19% of the dog sounds.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2022,2022-10-21 00:00:00,"Prabu Mohandas, Jerline Sheebha Anni, K.

With many independent teams working in different research areas, shared standards become an essential safeguard to ensure compliance with state-of-the-art methods allowing appropriate comparison of results across studies and potential integration and combination of extraction and recognition systems. In this paper we propose a basic standard acoustic parameter set for various areas of automatic voice analysis, such as paralinguistic or clinical speech analysis. In contrast to a large brute-force parameter set, we present a minimalistic set of voice parameters here. These were selected based on a) their potential to index affective physiological changes in voice production, b) their proven value in former studies as well as their automatic extractability, and c) their theoretical significance. The set is intended to provide a common baseline for evaluation of future research and eliminate differences caused by varying parameter sets or even different implementations of the same parameters. Our implementation is publicly available with the openSMILE toolkit. Comparative evaluations of the proposed feature set and large baseline feature sets of INTERSPEECH challenges show a high performance of the proposed set in relation to its size.",IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,journal,a88e2a6c-903f-42e1-8dfc-f2547e32020a,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,190-202,7,,2016,2016-04-01 00:00:00,"F.

Despite this, it has been suggested that during domestication dogs have become socially more tolerant and attentive than wolves. These two characteristics are crucial for cooperation, and it has been argued that these changes allowed dogs to successfully live and work with humans. However, these domestication hypotheses have been put forward mainly based on dog-wolf differences reported in regard to their interactions with humans. Thus, it is possible that these differences reflect only an improved capability of dogs to accept humans as social partners instead of an increase of their general tolerance, attentiveness and cooperativeness. At the Wolf Science Center, in order to detangle these two explanations, we raise and keep dogs and wolves similarly socializing them with conspecifics and humans and then test them in interactions not just with humans but also conspecifics. When investigating attentiveness toward human and conspecific partners using different paradigms, we found that the wolves were at least as attentive as the dogs to their social partners and their actions. Based on these findings and the social ecology of wolves, we propose the Canine Cooperation Hypothesis suggesting that wolves are characterized with high social attentiveness and tolerance and are highly cooperative. This is in contrast with the implications of most domestication hypotheses about wolves. We argue, however, that these characteristics of wolves likely provided a good basis for the evolution of dog-human cooperation.",Frontiers in Psychology,journal,89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06,Frontiers in Psychology,,5,,2015,2015-01-15 00:00:00,"F.

Simple methods for visualizing the spectra are proposed in order to guide the user in the choice of the best preprocessing. The most common chemometrics preprocessing are presented and illustrated by three real datasets. Some preprocessing aims to produce a spectrum as close as possible to the absorbance that would have been measured under ideal conditions and is very useful for the establishment of an aquagram. Others, dedicated to the improvement of the resolution of the spectra, are very useful for the identification of the peaks. Finally, special attention is given to the problem of reducing multiplicative effects and to the potential pitfalls of some very popular methods in chemometrics. Alternatives proposed in recent papers are presented.",Molecules,journal,91b19bbf-b6f0-46c2-bbec-6bcfb5463d4d,Molecules,,27,,2022,2022-10-01 00:00:00,"Jean-Michel Roger, A. Mallet, F.

cb004c1bd6796118879563b226def1973c41531c,10.3322/caac.21763,"Cancer statistics, 2023","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus‐associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.",Ca,journal,7777b179-7a66-44e1-bcc7-b454f2057262,CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians,17 - 48,73,,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,"R.

Here, we describe the technical details of the implementation of fluorescence lifetime and diffuse reflectance measurements by the system, equipped with an original needle optical probe, compatible with the 17.5G biopsy needle standard. The fluorescence lifetime measurements observed by the setup were verified in fresh solutions of NADH and FAD++, and then applied in a murine model for the characterisation of inoculated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent liver tissue. The technique, applied in vivo and in situ and supplemented by measurements of blood oxygen saturation, made it possible to reveal statistically significant transformation in the set of measured parameters linked with the cellular pools of NADH and NADPH. In the animal model, we demonstrate that the characteristic changes in registered fluorescent parameters can be used to reliably distinguish the HCC tissue, liver tissue in the control, and the metabolically changed liver tissues of animals with the developed HCC tumour. For further transition to clinical applications, the optical biopsy system was tested during the routing procedure of the PNB in humans with suspected HCC. The comparison of the data from murine and human HCC tissues suggests that the tested animal model is generally representative in the sense of the registered fluorescence lifetime parameters, while statistically significant differences between their absolute values can still be observed.",Biomedical Optics Express,journal,7e331686-6620-4481-a3d5-5effffe9ab83,Biomedical optics express,"

The proposed system includes an optical probe of small diameter acceptable for use in the PNB of the liver. The results of the feasibility studies and actual tests on laboratory mice with inoculated hepatocellular carcinoma and in clinical conditions on patients with liver tumors are presented and discussed. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to assess the diagnostic volume and to trace the sensing depth. Fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements were used to monitor metabolic and morphological changes in tissues. The tissue oxygen saturation was evaluated using a recently developed approach to neural network fitting of diffuse reflectance spectra. The Support Vector Machine Classification was applied to identify intact liver and tumor tissues. Analysis of the obtained results shows the high sensitivity and specificity of the proposed multimodal method. This approach allows to obtain information before the tissue sample is taken, which makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of false-negative biopsies.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,,2020,2020-08-26 00:00:00,"V.

Turn measures and activity rates were quantified. Fall incidence within 12 months from continuous monitoring defined fall status, with 7/153 prospective fallers/non-fallers. Based on the analysis of 718,582 turns, prospective fallers turned less frequently, took longer to turn, and were less consistent in turn angle (p = 0.007, 0.025, and 0.038, respectively). Prospective fallers also walked slower and spent less time walking and turning and more time engaged in sedentary behavior (p = 0.043, 0.012, and 0.015, respectively). Individuals experiencing decline in the control of gait and/or turning may attempt to reduce their risk of falling by limiting their exposure and implementing cautionary movement strategies while turning.

In NLP similar results are reported most commonly for low data regimes, non-pretrained models, or situationally for pretrained models. In this paper we ask how effective these techniques really are when applied to pretrained transformers. Using two popular varieties of task-agnostic data augmentation (not tailored to any particular task), Easy Data Augmentation (Wei andZou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrichet al., 2015), we conduct a systematic examination of their effects across 5 classification tasks, 6 datasets, and 3 variants of modern pretrained transformers, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. We observe a negative result, finding that techniques which previously reported strong improvements for non-pretrained models fail to consistently improve performance for pretrained transformers, even when training data is limited. We hope this empirical analysis helps inform practitioners where data augmentation techniques may confer improvements.",Findings,journal,479d5605-51be-4346-b1d6-4334084504df,,4401-4411,,,2020,2020-10-05 00:00:00,"S.

General population singleton pregnancies between 18 + 0 and 24 + 6 weeks’ gestation were assessed prospectively at two centers. Cervical ultrasound images were evaluated and the occurrence of sPTB before weeks 37 + 0 and 34 + 0 were recorded. CL was measured on-site. The automated texture analysis test was applied offline to all images. Their performance to predict the occurrence of sPTB before 37 + 0 and 34 + 0 weeks was evaluated separately and in combination on 633 recruited patients. AUC for sPTB prediction before weeks 37 and 34 respectively were as follows: 55.5% and 65.3% for CL, 63.4% and 66.3% for texture analysis, 67.5% and 76.7% when combined. The new test improved detection rates of CL at similar low FPR. Combining the two increased detection rate compared to CL alone from 13.0 to 30.4% for sPTB < 37 and from 14.3 to 42.9% sPTB < 34. Texture analysis of cervical ultrasound improved sPTB detection rate compared to cervical length for similar FPR, and the two combined together increased significantly prediction performance.

Methods Data came from 3159 obstetric patients and their newborns enrolled in a multi-center retrospective study. Variable importance, the effect of a variable on model performance, was used for identifying major predictors of newborn’s BMI among ultrasound measures and maternal/delivery information. The ultrasound measures included biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) taken three times during the week 21 - week 35 of gestational age and once in the week 36 or later. Results Based on variable importance from the random forest, major predictors of newborn’s BMI were the first AC and EFW in the week 36 or later, gestational age at delivery, the first AC during the week 21 - the week 35, maternal BMI at delivery, maternal weight at delivery and the first BPD in the week 36 or later. For predicting newborn’s BMI, linear regression (2.0744) and the random forest (2.1610) were better than artificial neural networks with one, two and three hidden layers (150.7100, 154.7198 and 152.5843, respectively) in the mean squared error. Conclusions This is the first machine-learning study with 64 clinical and sonographic markers for the prediction of newborns’ BMI. The week 36 or later is the most effective period for taking the ultrasound measures and AC and EFW are the best predictors of newborn’s BMI alongside gestational age at delivery and maternal BMI at delivery.",BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,journal,92fb02dc-9429-47c6-baea-96c5d54fc316,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,,21,,2021,2021-03-02 00:00:00,"Kwang-Sig Lee, Ho Yeon Kim, S.

Methods Images of fetal faces with sonography obtained from outpatient pregnant women with a singleton fetus were enrolled in routine conventional practice from 19 to 38 weeks of gestation from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, with completely de-identified data. The images were classified into seven categories, such as eye blinking, mouthing, face without any expression, scowling, smiling, tongue expulsion, and yawning. The category in which the number of fetuses was less than 10 was eliminated before preparation. Next, we created a deep learning AI classifier with the data. Statistical values such as accuracy for the test dataset and the AI confidence score profiles for each category per image for all data were obtained. Results The number of fetuses/images in the rated categories were 14/147, 23/302, 33/320, 8/55, and 10/72 for eye blinking, mouthing, face without any expression, scowling, and yawning, respectively. The accuracy of the AI fetal facial expression for the entire test data set was 0.985. The accuracy/sensitivity/specificity values were 0.996/0.993/1.000, 0.992/0.986/1.000, 0.985/1.000/0.979, 0.996/0.888/1.000, and 1.000/1.000/1.000 for the eye blinking, mouthing, face without any expression, scowling categories, and yawning, respectively. Conclusions The AI classifier has the potential to objectively classify fetal facial expressions.

However, there is a subset of patients who develop recurrence. In addition to the pathological stage, clinical and therapeutic factors affect the probability of recurrence. Machine learning is a subtype of artificial intelligence that is considered effective for predictive tasks. We tried to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer using machine learning methods based on clinical data. Methods We enrolled 75 patients with early stage endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I or II) who had received surgical treatment at our institute. A total of 5 machine learning classifiers were used, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and boosted tree, to predict the recurrence based on 16 parameters (age, body mass index, gravity/parity, hypertension/diabetic, stage, histological type, grade, surgical content and adjuvant chemotherapy). We analyzed the classification accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC). Results The highest accuracy was 0.82 for SVM, followed by 0.77 for RF, 0.74 for LR, 0.66 for DT, and 0.66 for boosted trees. The highest AUC was 0.53 for LR, followed by 0.52 for boosted trees, 0.48 for DT, and 0.47 for RF. Therefore, the best predictive model for this analysis was LR. Conclusion The performance of the machine learning classifiers was not optimal owing to the small size of the dataset.

Objectives This work aimed to establish effective models to predict early GDM. Methods Pregnancy data for 73 variables during the first trimester were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Based on a machine learning (ML)-driven feature selection method, 17 variables were selected for early GDM prediction. To facilitate clinical application, 7 variables were selected from the 17-variable panel. Advanced ML approaches were then employed using the 7-variable data set and the 73-variable data set to build models predicting early GDM for different situations, respectively. Results A total of 16 819 and 14 992 cases were included in the training and testing sets, respectively. Using 73 variables, the deep neural network model achieved high discriminative power, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.80. The 7-variable logistic regression (LR) model also achieved effective discriminate power (AUC = 0.77). Low body mass index (BMI) (≤ 17) was related to an increased risk of GDM, compared to a BMI in the range of 17 to 18 (minimum risk interval) (11.8% vs 8.7%, P = .09). Total 3,3,5′-triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxin (T4) were superior to free T3 and free T4 in predicting GDM. Lipoprotein(a) was demonstrated a promising predictive value (AUC = 0.66). Conclusions We employed ML models that achieved high accuracy in predicting GDM in early pregnancy. A clinically cost-effective 7-variable LR model was simultaneously developed. The relationship of GDM with thyroxine and BMI was investigated in the Chinese population.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,journal,80784324-e8da-41d8-99fb-e2018faa0537,The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,e1191 - e1205,106,,2020,2020-12-22 00:00:00,"Yan-ting Wu, Chenjie Zhang, B.

Trajectories are treated as time-series data, with the features for clustering selected by variance mapping of normalized data. The L2-norm and dynamic time warping are proposed as suitable similarity measures for calculating the distance matrices, and these are clustered using the unsupervised density-based DBSCAN algorithm. The silhouette coefficient and the number of trajectories classified as noise are used as quality measures for the clustering. The ability of clustering to provide rapid overview of large and complex trajectory data sets, and its utility for extracting chemical and physical insight, is demonstrated on trajectories corresponding to the photochemical ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, noting that the clustering can be used to generate reduced dimensionality representations in an unbiased manner.",Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,journal,05f4640f-1261-4186-8153-0cb50b1169b3,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,6126 - 6138,19,,2023,2023-09-13 00:00:00,"Kyle Acheson, A.

With an emissive bendable organic crystalline material, here we propose that organic crystals can be used as mechanically robust and compliant fluorescence-based thermal sensors with wide range of temperature coverage and complete retention of mechanical elasticity. The exemplary material described remains elastically bendable and shows highly linear correlation with the emission wavelength and intensity between 77 K to 277 K, while it also transduces its own fluorescence in active waveguiding mode. This universal new approach expands the materials available for optical thermal sensing to a vast number of organic crystals as a new class of engineering materials and opens opportunities for the design of lightweight, organic fluorescence-based thermal sensors that can operate under extreme temperature conditions such as are the ones that will be encountered in future space exploration missions.

However, data for these traits are limited to specific field sites. Despite this limitation, field-scale calibrated crop models for high-yielding traits are being applied over large scales using gridded weather and soil datasets. This study investigates the implications of this practice. The SIMPLACE modeling platform was applied using field, 1 km, 25 km, and 50 km input data resolution and sources, with 1881 combinations of three traits [radiation use efficiency (RUE), light extinction coefficient (K), and fruiting efficiency (FE)] for the period 2001–2010 across Germany. Simulations at the grid level were aggregated to the administrative units, enabling the quantification of the aggregation effect. The simulated yield increased by between 1.4 and 3.1 t ha− 1 with a maximum RUE trait value, compared to a control cultivar. No significant yield improvement (< 0.4 t ha− 1) was observed with increases in K and FE alone. Utilizing field-scale input data showed the greatest yield improvement per unit increment in RUE. Resolution of water related inputs (soil characteristics and precipitation) had a notably higher impact on simulated yield than of temperature. However, it did not alter the effects of high-yielding traits on yield. Simulated yields were only slightly affected by data aggregation for the different trait combinations. Warm-dry conditions diminished the benefits of high-yielding traits, suggesting that benefits from high-yielding traits depend on environments. The current findings emphasize the critical role of input data resolution and source in quantifying a large-scale impact of high-yielding traits.

 Wheat's nutritional value is critical for human nutrition and food security. However, more attention is needed, particularly regarding the content and concentration of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), especially in the context of climate change (CC) impacts. To address this, various controlled field experiments were conducted, involving the cultivation of three wheat cultivars over three growing seasons at multiple locations with different soil and climate conditions under varying Fe and Zn treatments. The yield and yield attributes, including nutritional values such as nitrogen (N), Fe and Zn, from these experiments were integrated with national yield statistics from other locations to train and test different machine learning (ML) algorithms. Automated ML leveraging a large number of models, outperformed traditional ML models, enabling the training and testing of numerous models, and achieving robust predictions of grain yield (GY) (R2 > 0.78), N (R2 > 0.75), Fe (R2 > 0.71) and Zn (R2 > 0.71) through a stacked ensemble of all models. The ensemble model predicted GY, N, Fe, and Zn at spatial explicit in the mid-century (2020-2050) using three Global Circulation Models (GCMs): GFDL-ESM4, HadGEM3-GC31-MM, and MRI-ESM2-0 under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) specifically SSP2-45 and SSP5-85, from the downscaled NEX-GDDP-CMIP6. Averaged across different GCMs and SSPs, CC is projected to increase wheat yield by 4.5 %, and protein concentration by 0.8 % with high variability. However, it is expected to decrease Fe concentration by 5.5 %, and Zn concentration by 4.5 % in the mid-century (2020-2050) relative to the historical period (1980-2010). Positive impacts of CC on wheat yield encountered by negative impacts on nutritional concentrations, further exacerbating challenges related to food security and nutrition.",Environmental Research Letters,journal,373ee421-9890-40bc-87d7-59518033a715,Environmental Research Letters,,,,2024,2024-08-30 00:00:00,"A.

The increasing adoption of MLSs in safety critical domains such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance has fostered much attention towards the quality assurance of such systems. Despite the advances in software testing, MLSs bring novel and unprecedented challenges, since their behaviour is defined jointly by the code that implements them and the data used for training them. To identify the existing solutions for functional testing of MLSs, and classify them from three different perspectives: (1) the context of the problem they address, (2) their features, and (3) their empirical evaluation. To report demographic information about the ongoing research. To identify open challenges for future research. We conducted a systematic mapping study about testing techniques for MLSs driven by 33 research questions. We followed existing guidelines when defining our research protocol so as to increase the repeatability and reliability of our results. We identified 70 relevant primary studies, mostly published in the last years. We identified 11 problems addressed in the literature. We investigated multiple aspects of the testing approaches, such as the used/proposed adequacy criteria, the algorithms for test input generation, and the test oracles.

The accuracy of these calculations depends on the force field quality and on the thoroughness of configuration sampling. Sampling is an obstacle in simulations due to the frequent appearance of kinetic bottlenecks in the free energy landscape. Very often this difficulty is circumvented by enhanced sampling techniques. Typically, these techniques depend on the introduction of appropriate collective variables that are meant to capture the system’s degrees of freedom. In ligand binding, water has long been known to play a key role, but its complex behaviour has proven difficult to fully capture. In this paper we combine machine learning with physical intuition to build a non-local and highly efficient water-describing collective variable. We use it to study a set of host-guest systems from the SAMPL5 challenge. We obtain highly accurate binding free energies and good agreement with experiments. The role of water during the binding process is then analysed in some detail. Computational approaches to predict water’s role in host-ligand binding attract a great deal of attention.

In particular, the binding free energy of a drug candidate to its biomolecular target is used as an objective quantity in drug design. Recently, binding kinetics—rates of association (kon) and dissociation (koff)—have also demonstrated utility for their ability to predict efficacy and in some cases have been shown to be more predictive than the binding free energy alone. Some methods exist to calculate binding kinetics from molecular simulations, although these are typically more difficult to calculate than the binding affinity as they depend on details of the transition path ensemble. Assessing these rate constants can be difficult, due to uncertainty in the definition of the bound and unbound states, large error bars and the lack of experimental data. As an additional consistency check, rate constants from simulation can be used to calculate free energies (using the log of their ratio) which can then be compared to free energies obtained experimentally or using alchemical free energy perturbation. However, in this calculation it is not straightforward to account for common, practical details such as the finite simulation volume or the particular definition of the “bound” and “unbound” states. Here we derive a set of correction terms that can be applied to calculations of binding free energies using full reactive trajectories. We apply these correction terms to revisit the calculation of binding free energies from rate constants for a host-guest system that was part of a blind prediction challenge, where significant deviations were observed between free energies calculated with rate ratios and those calculated from alchemical perturbation. The correction terms combine to significantly decrease the error with respect to computational benchmarks, from 3.4 to 0.76 kcal/mol. Although these terms were derived with weighted ensemble simulations in mind, some of the correction terms are generally applicable to free energies calculated using physical pathways via methods such as Markov state modeling, metadynamics, milestoning, or umbrella sampling.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,journal,a75714cc-ae87-4828-a0a2-e7f8d57a5632,Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,,7,,2020,2020-06-05 00:00:00,"Robert Hall, Tom Dixon, Alex Dickson","2069314965, 2067829627, 48487951",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1897d451b669ea9e69484a31a44aa2175cb33449,"Chemistry, Medicine, Physics",2069314965,['JournalArticle'],33.0,73.0

Thus, the modelling, characterization, classification, diagnosis, and analysis of such mental disorders bears great significance in medical research. Electroencephalogram records provide important information to improve clinical diagnosis and are very useful in the scientific community. In this work, electroencephalogram records and patient data from the Hospital Virgen de la Luz in Cuenca (Spain) were processed for a correct classification of bipolar disorders. This work implemented an innovative radial basis function-based neural network employing a fuzzy means algorithm. The results show that the proposed method is an effective approach for discrimination of two kinds of classes, i.e., bipolar disorder patients and healthy persons. The proposed algorithm achieved the best performance compared with other machine learning techniques such as Bayesian linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian naive Bayes, decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, or support vector machine, showing a very high accuracy close to 97%. Therefore, the neural network technique presented could be used as a new tool for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, considering the possibility of integrating this method into medical software.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2022,2022-01-23 00:00:00,"M.

Currently, several approaches classified as electrical, magnetic, neuroimaging recordings and brain stimulations are available to obtain neural activity of the human brain. Among them, non-invasive methods like electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly employed, as they can provide a high degree of temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds) and acceptable space resolution. In addition, it is simple, quick, and does not create any physical harm or stress to patients. Concerning signal processing, once the neural signals are acquired, different procedures can be applied for feature extraction. In particular, brain signals are normally processed in time, frequency, and/or space domains. The features extracted are then used for signal classification depending on its characteristics such us the mean, variance or band power. The role of machine learning in this regard has become of key importance during the last years due to its high capacity to analyze complex amounts of data. The algorithms employed are generally classified in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement techniques. A deep review of the most used machine learning algorithms and the advantages/drawbacks of most used methods is presented. Finally, a study of these procedures utilized in a very specific and novel research field of electroencephalography, i.e., autobiographical memory deficits in schizophrenia, is outlined.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2021,2021-12-05 00:00:00,"M.

Given that anxiety disorders are one of the most common comorbidities in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), this population is particularly vulnerable to mental stress, severely limiting overall quality of life. To prevent this, early stress quantification with machine learning (ML) and effective anxiety mitigation with non-pharmacological interventions are essential. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of exploiting electroencephalography (EEG) signals for stress assessment by comparing several ML classifiers, namely support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning methods. We trained a total of eleven subject-dependent models-four with conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) methods and seven with deep learning approaches-on the EEG of neurotypical ( n =5) and ASD ( n =8) participants performing alternating blocks of mental arithmetic stress induction, guided and unguided breathing. Our results show that a multiclass two-layer LSTM RNN deep learning classifier is capable of identifying mental stress from ongoing EEG with an overall accuracy of 93.27%. Our study is the first to successfully apply an LSTM RNN classifier to identify stress states from EEG in both ASD and neurotypical adolescents, and offers promise for an EEG-based BCI for the real-time assessment and mitigation of mental stress through a closed-loop adaptation of respiration entrainment.",Brain Informatics,journal,b409d450-86da-43c3-b686-a9eb1f61675c,Brain Informatics,,8,,2021,2021-07-13 00:00:00,"Avirath Sundaresan, Brian Penchina, Sean Cheong, Victoria Grace, A.

In the era of digital medicine and precision therapeutics, new personalized treatment approaches are warranted for depression. Here, we use a combination of longitudinal ecological momentary assessments of depression, neurocognitive sampling synchronized with electroencephalography, and lifestyle data from wearables to generate individualized predictions of depressed mood over a 1-month time period. This study, thus, develops a systematic pipeline for N-of-1 personalized modeling of depression using multiple modalities of data. In the models, we integrate seven types of supervised machine learning (ML) approaches for each individual, including ensemble learning and regression-based methods. All models were verified using fourfold nested cross-validation. The best-fit as benchmarked by the lowest mean absolute percentage error, was obtained by a different type of ML model for each individual, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. The voting regressor, which is a composite strategy across ML models, was best performing on-average across subjects. However, the individually selected best-fit models still showed significantly less error than the voting regressor performance across subjects. For each individual’s best-fit personalized model, we further extracted top-feature predictors using Shapley statistics. Shapley values revealed distinct feature determinants of depression over time for each person ranging from co-morbid anxiety, to physical exercise, diet, momentary stress and breathing performance, sleep times, and neurocognition. In future, these personalized features can serve as targets for a personalized ML-guided, multimodal treatment strategy for depression.",Translational Psychiatry,journal,18232e92-ef10-46fd-ad77-bb418dcd525d,Translational Psychiatry,,11,,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,"Rutvik Shah, G.

This paper describes the development of a model for the turbulence spectrum measured by a short-range, continuous-wave lidar. The lidar performance was assessed by measurements conducted with two WindScanners in an open jet wind tunnel equipped with an active grid, for a range of different turbulent wind conditions. A one-dimensional hot wire anemometer was used as a reference for characterising the lidar turbulence measurement. In addition to addressing the statistics, the correlation between the time series and the mean error on the wind speed, the lidar measurement turbulence spectrum is compared with a theoretical spectrum using Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A theoretical model for the probe length averaging effect is applied in the frequency domain, using a Lorentzian filter in combination with generated white noise, and evaluated by qualitatively matching the lidar measurement spectrum. High goodness of fit coefficients and low mean absolute errors between hot wire and WindScanner were observed for the measured time series. The correlation showed an inverse relationship with the prevalent turbulence intensity in the flow for cases with a comparable power spectrum shape. Larger flow structures can be captured more accurately by the lidar, whereas small-scale turbulent flow structures are partly filtered out as a result of the lidars' probe volume averaging. It is demonstrated that an accurate way to define the frequency at which the lidar power spectrum starts to deviate from the hot wire reference spectrum is the point at which the coherence drops below 0.5. This coherence-based cut-off frequency increases linearly with the mean wind speed and is generally an order of magnitude lower than the probe length cut-off frequency, estimated according to a simple model based on Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A convincing match between the modelled and the actual WindScanner power spectrum was found for various different cases, which confirmed that the deviation of the lidar measurement power spectrum in the higher frequency range can be analytically explained and modelled as a combination of a Lorentzian probe length averaging effect and white noise in the lidar measurement.

A rig for calibrating a continuous-wave coherent Doppler wind lidar has been constructed. The rig consists of a rotating flywheel on a frame together with an adjustable lidar telescope. The laser beam points toward the rim of the wheel in a plane perpendicular to the wheel's rotation axis, and it can be tilted up and down along the wheel's periphery and thereby measure different projections of the tangential speed. The angular speed of the wheel is measured using a high-precision measuring ring fitted to the periphery of the wheel and synchronously logged together with the lidar speed. A simple geometrical model shows that there is a linear relationship between the measured line-of-sight speed and the beam tilt angle, and this is utilised to extrapolate to the tangential speed as measured by the lidar. An analysis of the uncertainties based on the model shows that a standard uncertainty on the measurement of about 0.1 % can be achieved, but also that the main source of uncertainty is the width of the laser beam and its associated uncertainty. Measurements performed with different beam widths confirm this. Other measurements with a minimised beam radius show that the method in this case performs about equally well for all the tested reference speeds ranging from about 3 to 18 m s−1.

However, a report from Southern Finance Omnimedia Corp of China pointed out that among China's top 1,000 livestream sellers, the top 20 sellers have contributed to nearly half of the gross merchandise volume (GMV), using three major Chinese streaming platforms: Taobao, Douyin, and Kuaishou. Moreover, a novice in livestream e-commerce knows less about the important impact factors of the realm. Akin to the adage, “well aware is well prepared,” knowing more about the influencing factors of livestream e-commerce more will be the chances to promote the commercial value. A benchmark research is needed to systematically trace out the most important and influencing factors and to make possible the rising of selling with less effort, hence this study. The research intends to sort out the relevant influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce by reviewing previous related literature. Then, through the Delphi method, eight experts constructed the 14 main influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce. Through DEMATEL-ANP, we can not only find the key factors but also sort out the causal relationship between the main key factors, forming a preliminary evaluation model of the commercial value of livestream sellers. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) of these impact factors found that “seller popularity” is the most critical factor affecting consumers’ shopping motivation. At the same time, product discounts, product quality, and the attractiveness of the sellers are being included in effects by the “seller popularity.” The investigation followed in this study revealed that characteristics of the livestream seller are one of the most influencing factor achieving a total weight of 0.3020, whereas the streaming platform is the least influencing factor (total weight is 0.1333). The assessment made the study explore the sustainability of livestream e-commerce in China, and the proposed evaluation model can be used for the preliminary business value evaluation of people engaged in livestream sellers and related industries.",Scientific Programming,journal,d5b215f3-f737-45b2-875b-df309ce14c43,Scientific Programming,,,,2022,2022-02-21 00:00:00,"Haonan Cheng, Yitian Huang, Jesheng Huang","2182553767, 115026140, 2155720642",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9710f7a0bf137cf2610bc6b1ebcf5319b1cb711e,"Business, Computer Science, Economics, Medicine",2182553767,['Review'],14.0,87.0

We propose the LDA-ARMA deep neural network for dynamic presentation and fine-grained categorization of a public opinion events. This was applied to a huge quantity of online public opinion texts in a complicated setting and integrated the proposed sentiment measurement algorithm. To begin, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to extract information about the topic of comments. The autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) was then utilized to perform multidimensional sentiment analysis and evolution prediction on large-scale textual data related to COVID-19 published by netizens from Wuhan and other countries on Sina Weibo. The results show that Wuhan netizens paid more attention to the development of the situation, treatment measures, and policies related to COVID-19 than other issues, and were under greater emotional pressure, whereas netizens in the rest of the country paid more attention to the overall COVID-19 prevention and control, and were more positive and optimistic with the assistance of the government and NGOs. The average error in predicting public opinion sentiment was less than 5.64%, demonstrating that this approach may be effectively applied to the analysis of large-scale online public sentiment evolution.",Complex & Intelligent Systems,journal,d30c9917-b233-46f4-a644-8e5cdf6d6c5e,Complex & Intelligent Systems,3165 - 3178,7,,2021,2021-09-04 00:00:00,"Muni Zhuang, Yong Li, Xin Tan, Lining Xing, Xin Lu","114556431, 2154403803, 144184998, 3221314, 2124828121",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/632b89ad9807650c69e4ccaa00d5f6231df451dc,"Computer Science, Medicine, Political Science",114556431,['JournalArticle'],23.0,29.0

However, the network public opinion tends to generate strongly misleading and a large number of messages can cause shocks to the public once major emergencies appear. Therefore, we need to make correct prediction regarding and timely identify a potential crisis in the early warning of network public opinion. In view of this, this study fully considers the features of development and the propagation characteristics, so as to construct a network public opinion early warning index system that includes 4 first-level indicators and 13 second-level indicators. The weight of each indicator is calculated by the “CRITIC” method, so that the comprehensive evaluation value of each time point can be obtained and the early warning level of internet public opinion can be divided. Then, the Back Propagation neural network based on Genetic Algorithm (GA-BP) is used to establish a network public opinion early warning model. Finally, the major public health emergency, COVID-19 pandemic, is taken as a case for empirical analysis. The results show that by comparing with the traditional classification methods, such as BP neural network, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and naive Bayes, GA-BP neural network has a higher accuracy rate for early warning of network public opinion. Consequently, the index system and early warning model constructed in this study have good feasibility and can provide references for related research on internet public opinion.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,Ieee Access,44162 - 44172,9,,2021,2021-03-17 00:00:00,"Lijuan Peng, Xigao Shao, Wan-Ming Huang","1807740402, 2801293, 2109163814",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9f76539690fd601bf0ecda6f9b3c689bc6bf79f,"Computer Science, Medicine, Political Science",1807740402,['JournalArticle'],19.0,25.0

Monitoring grapevine water status and stress level across the whole vineyard is an essential step for precision irrigation management of vineyards to conserve water. We developed a unified machine learning model to map leaf water potential ( $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf ), by combining high-resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery and weather data. We conducted six unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights with a five-band multispectral camera from 2018 to 2020 over three commercial vineyards, concurrently with ground measurements of sampled vines. Using vegetation indices from the orthomosaiced UAV imagery and weather data as predictors, the random forest (RF) full model captured 77% of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf variance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 MPa, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.100 MPa, based on the validation datasets. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and red edge indices such as the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) were found as the most important variables in estimating $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf across space and time. The reduced RF models excluding weather and red edge indices explained 52–48% of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf variance, respectively. Maps of the estimated $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf from the RF full model captured well the patterns of both within- and cross-field spatial variability and the temporal change of vine water status, consistent with irrigation management and patterns observed from the ground sampling. Our results demonstrated the utility of UAV-based aerial multispectral imaging for supplementing and scaling up the traditional point-based ground sampling of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf . The pre-trained machine learning model, driven by UAV imagery and weather data, provides a cost-effective and scalable tool to facilitate data-driven precision irrigation management at individual vine levels in vineyards.",Irrigation science,journal,bfe7cd76-b337-419a-95e7-32b82ec6cdb5,Irrigation Science,715-730,40,,2022,2022-04-18 00:00:00,"Zhehan Tang, Yufang Jin, M.

Breeding programs are in search of new drought tolerant forage grass varieties, but those programs still rely on time-consuming and less consistent visual scoring by breeders. In this study, we evaluate whether Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing can complement or replace this visual breeder score. A field experiment was set up to test the drought tolerance of genotypes from three common forage types of two different species: Festuca arundinacea, diploid Lolium perenne and tetraploid Lolium perenne. Drought stress was imposed by using mobile rainout shelters. UAV flights with RGB and thermal sensors were conducted at five time points during the experiment. Visual-based indices from different colour spaces were selected that were closely correlated to the breeder score. Furthermore, several indices, in particular H and NDLab, from the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and CIELab (Commission Internationale de l’éclairage) colour space, respectively, displayed a broad-sense heritability that was as high or higher than the visual breeder score, making these indices highly suited for high-throughput field phenotyping applications that can complement or even replace the breeder score. The thermal-based Crop Water Stress Index CWSI provided complementary information to visual-based indices, enabling the analysis of differences in ecophysiological mechanisms for coping with reduced water availability between species and ploidy levels. All species/types displayed variation in drought stress tolerance, which confirms that there is sufficient variation for selection within these groups of grasses. Our results confirmed the better drought tolerance potential of Festuca arundinacea, but also showed which Lolium perenne genotypes are more tolerant.",Remote Sensing,journal,8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

Big data is a crucial aspect of modern computing, and the choice of processing framework can significantly impact performance and efficiency. The technical revolution of big data has changed how organizations handle and value large databases. As data quantities expand quickly, effective and scalable data processing systems are essential. MapReduce and Apache Spark are two of the most popular large data processing techniques. This study compares these two frameworks to determine their merits, shortcomings, and applicability for big data applications. Nearly quintillion bytes of data are created daily. Approximately 90% of data was produced in the previous two years. At this stage, data comes from temperature sensors, social media, movies, photographs, transaction records (like banking records), mobile phone conversations, GPS signals, etc. In this article, all key big data technologies are introduced. This document compares all big data technologies and discusses their merits and downsides. Run trials using multiple data sets of varying sizes to validate and explain the study. Graphical depiction shows how one tool outperforms others for given data. Big Data is data generated by the rapid usage of the internet, sensors, and heavy machinery, with great volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Numbers, photos, videos, and text are omnipresent in every sector. Due to the pace and amount of data generation, the computing system struggles to manage large data. Data is stored in a distributed architectural file system due to its size and complexity. Big distributed file systems, which must be fault-tolerant, adaptable, and scalable, make complicated data analysis dangerous and time-consuming. Big data collection is called ‘datafication’. Big data is ‘datafied’ for productivity.

However, at present, they do not seem to exploit all their potential. The objective of this study is to explore innovative proposals for the use of wearable wrist technology in the field of sports, to understand its potential and identify new challenges and lines of future research related to this technology. A systematic review of the scientific literature, collected in 4 major repositories, was carried out to locate research initiatives where wrist wearables were introduced to address some sports-related challenges. Those works that were limited to evaluating sensor performance in sports activities and those in which wrist wearable devices did not play a significant role were excluded. 26 articles were eventually selected for full-text analysis that discuss the introduction of wrist-worn wearables to address some innovative use in the sports field. This study showcases relevant proposals in 10 different sports. The research initiatives identified are oriented to the use of wearable wrist technology (i) for the comprehensive monitoring of sportspeople’s behavior in activities not supported by the vendors, (ii) to identify specific types of movements or actions in specific sports, and (iii) to prevent injuries. There are, however, open issues that should be tackled in the future, such as the incorporation of these devices in sports activities not currently addressed, or the provision of specific recommendation services for sport practitioners.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2019,2019-11-01 00:00:00,"Juan M.

These systems improve the quality of life and the health care of the elderly and dependent people. However, before making them available to end users, it is necessary to evaluate their performance in recognizing activities of daily living, using data set benchmarks in experimental scenarios. For that reason, the scientific community has developed and provided a huge amount of data sets for HAR. Therefore, identifying which ones to use in the evaluation process and which techniques are the most appropriate for prediction of HAR in a specific context is not a trivial task and is key to further progress in this area of research. This work presents a systematic review of the literature of the sensor-based data sets used to evaluate ARS. On the one hand, an analysis of different variables taken from indexed publications related to this field was performed. The sources of information are journals, proceedings, and books located in specialized databases. The analyzed variables characterize publications by year, database, type, quartile, country of origin, and destination, using scientometrics, which allowed identification of the data set most used by researchers. On the other hand, the descriptive and functional variables were analyzed for each of the identified data sets: occupation, annotation, approach, segmentation, representation, feature selection, balancing and addition of instances, and classifier used for recognition. This paper provides an analysis of the sensor-based data sets used in HAR to date, identifying the most appropriate dataset to evaluate ARS and the classification techniques that generate better results.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,59192-59210,6,,2018,2018-09-22 00:00:00,"Emiro De-la-Hoz-Franco, P.

Based on a large cohort of newly diagnosed CLL/SLL patients from China, we investigated immunophenotypes, genetic abnormalities, and their correlations. Eighty-four percent of the CLL/SLL patients showed typical immunophenotypes with scores of 4 or 5 points in the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) scoring system (classic group), and the remaining 16% of patients were atypical with scores lower than 4 points (atypical group). Trisomy 12 and variants of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, ATM, and MYD88 were the most recurrent genetic aberrations. Additionally, unsupervised genomic analysis based on molecular genetics revealed distinctive characteristics of MYD88 variants in CLL/SLL. By overlapping different correlation grouping analysis from genetics to immunophenotypes, the results showed MYD88 variants to be highly related to atypical CLL/SLL immunophenotypes. Furthermore, compared with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the genetic landscape showed potential value in clinical differential diagnosis of atypical CLL/SLL and MCL patients. These results reveal immunophenotypic and genetic features, and may provide insights into the tumorigenesis and clinical management of Chinese CLL/SLL patients.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,journal,7fe84005-586f-4604-98ee-fa60fe8ae618,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,12,,2023,2023-04-01 00:00:00,"Yafei Mu, Xijie Fan, Tao Chen, Yuhuan Meng, Junwei Lin, Jiecheng Yuan, Shihui Yu, Yuxin Chen, Lingling Liu","2174182590, 2148285161, 2213345932, 34437182, 2213355286, 2174199158, 2152831865, 2213150142, 49479926",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e45c9012f7d222231cbb1018e7bf317ca4c3640,Medicine,2174182590,['JournalArticle'],2.0,32.0

Little is known about how EZH2 affects patients’ response to therapy. In this context, the aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the frequency of mutations in EZH2 at diagnosis in tissue and ctDNA in patients with FL and to assess the patients’ outcomes after receiving immunochemotherapy, depending on the EZH2 mutation status. Among the 154 patients included in the study, 27% had mutated EZH2 (46% with high-grade and 26% with low-grade FL). Of the mutated tissue samples, the mutation in ctDNA was identified in 44% of cases. EZH2 mutation in ctDNA was not identified in any patient unmutated in the tissue. Unmutated patients who received R-CHOP had significantly more relapses than patients who received R-Bendamustine (16/49 vs. 2/23, p  = 0.040). Furthermore, our results show that patients with mutated EZH2 treated with R-CHOP vs. those treated with R-Bendamustine present a lower incidence of relapse (10% vs. 42% p  = 0.09 at 4 years), a higher PFS (92% vs. 40% p  = 0.039 at 4 years), and higher OS (100% vs. 78% p  = 0.039 at 4 years). Based on these data, RCHOP could be a more suitable regimen for mutated patients, and R-bendamustine for unmutated patients.

Germline variants can influence treatment response and contribute to the development of treatment-related second neoplasms, especially in childhood leukemia. We aimed to analyze the genomes of patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders for the discovery of genes enriched in rare pathogenic variants. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in germline rare and dysfunctional variants. Additionally, we detected rare and likely pathogenic variants associated with disease prognosis and potential druggability, indicating a relevant role of these events in the variability of cancer phenotypes. Abstract There is growing evidence indicating the implication of germline variation in cancer predisposition and prognostication. Here, we describe an analysis of likely disruptive rare variants across the genomes of 726 patients with B-cell lymphoid neoplasms. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in rare dysfunctional variants, both of which participate in the regulation of oxidative stress pathways (CHMP6 and GSTA4). Additionally, we detected 1675 likely disrupting variants in genes associated with cancer, of which 44.75% were novel events and 7.88% were protein-truncating variants. Among these, the most frequently affected genes were ATM, BIRC6, CLTCL1A, and TSC2. Homozygous or germline double-hit variants were detected in 28 cases, and coexisting somatic events were observed in 17 patients, some of which affected key lymphoma drivers such as ATM, KMT2D, and MYC. Finally, we observed that variants in six different genes were independently associated with shorter survival in CLL. Our study results support an important role for rare germline variation in the pathogenesis and prognosis of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms.",Cancers,journal,d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,13,,2021,2021-03-01 00:00:00,"A.

In this review, we focus on management concepts shared across iNHLs, as well as histology-specific strategies. We address open questions in the field, including the influence of genomics and molecular pathway alterations on treatment decisions. In addition, we review the management of uncommon clinical entities including nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, splenic lymphoma and primary lymphoma of extranodal sites.

Recent studies suggest that the immune microenvironment plays a role in treatment response prediction and survival in DLBCL. This study developed a risk prediction model and evaluated the model’s biological implications in association with the estimated profiles of immune infiltration. Gene-expression profiling of 718 patients with DLBCL was done, for which RNA sequencing data and clinical covariates were obtained from Reddy et al. (2017). Using unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to identify survival-associated gene signatures, a multivariable model of survival was constructed. Tumor-infiltrating immune cell compositions were enumerated using CIBERSORT deconvolution analysis. A four gene-signature-based score was developed that separated patients into high- and low-risk groups. The combination of the gene-expression-based score with the IPI improved the discrimination on the validation and complete sets. The gene signatures were successfully validated with the deconvolution output. Correlating the deconvolution findings with the gene signatures and risk score, CD8+ T-cells and naïve CD4+ T-cells were associated with favorable prognosis. By analyzing the gene-expression data with a systematic approach, a risk prediction model that outperforms the existing risk assessment methods was developed and validated.",Blood Cancer Journal,journal,0bb3a38c-e934-4d7f-91fd-340db2b5c6a5,Blood Cancer Journal,,11,,2021,2021-01-01 00:00:00,"S.

Methods A total of 1270 COVID-19 patients, including 984 admitted in Sino French New City Branch (training and internal validation sets randomly split at 7:3 ratio) and 286 admitted in Optical Valley Branch (external validation set) of Wuhan Tongji hospital, were included in this study. Forty-eight clinical and laboratory features were screened with LASSO method. Further multi-tree extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning-based model was used to rank importance of features selected from LASSO and subsequently constructed death risk prediction model with simple-tree XGBoost model. Performances of models were evaluated by AUC, prediction accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Results Six features, including disease severity, age, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were selected as predictors for COVID-19 mortality. Simple-tree XGBoost model conducted by these features can predict death risk accurately with >90% precision and >85% sensitivity, as well as F1 scores >0.90 in training and validation sets. Conclusion We proposed the disease severity, age, serum levels of hs-CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-10 as significant predictors for death risk of COVID-19, which may help to identify the high-risk COVID-19 cases.

07a5a4418c0b84a88c2a03487affcccc4bf245e7,10.2196/17125,A Deep Artificial Neural Network−Based Model for Prediction of Underlying Cause of Death From Death Certificates: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Background Coding of underlying causes of death from death certificates is a process that is nowadays undertaken mostly by humans with potential assistance from expert systems, such as the Iris software. It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the CépiDc (Centre d’épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de Décès) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner. Objective This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death. Methods The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject’s age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject’s underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network−based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach’s superiority was assessed via bootstrap. Results The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010. Conclusions This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.",JMIR Medical Informatics,journal,dc6419f3-98b3-4718-bba0-6b6d6c3d192b,JMIR Medical Informatics,,8,,2020,2020-04-01 00:00:00,"Louis Falissard, C.

This work studies a mathematical problem motivated by the bi‐objective optimization of data‐parallel applications on such platforms for performance and energy. First, we formulate the problem and present an exact algorithm of polynomial complexity solving the problem where all the application profiles of objective type one are continuous and strictly increasing, and all the application profiles of objective type two are linear increasing. We then apply the algorithm to develop solutions for two related optimization problems of parallel applications on heterogeneous hybrid platforms, one for performance and dynamic energy and the other for performance and total energy. Our proposed solution methods are then employed to solve the two bi‐objective optimization problems for two data‐parallel applications, matrix multiplication and gene sequencing, on a hybrid platform employing five heterogeneous processors, namely, two different Intel multicore CPUs, an Nvidia K40c GPU, an Nvidia P100 PCIe GPU, and an Intel Xeon Phi.",Concurrency and Computation,journal,312ca99c-9149-490d-813e-c60d5e949f65,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,,35,,2022,2022-09-02 00:00:00,"Hamidreza Khaleghzadeh, Ravi Reddy, Alexey L.

It has no cure and the symptoms vary widely, depending on the affected regions, amount of damage, and the ability to activate compensatory mechanisms, which constitutes a challenge to evaluate and predict its course. Additionally, relapsing-remitting patients can evolve its course into a secondary progressive, characterized by a slow progression of disability independent of relapses. With clinical information from Multiple Sclerosis patients, we developed a machine learning exploration framework concerning this disease evolution, more specifically to obtain three predictions: one on conversion to secondary progressive course and two on disease severity with rapid accumulation of disability, concerning the 6th and 10th years of progression. For the first case, the best results were obtained within two years: AUC=0.86±0.07\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.86\pm 0.07$$\end{document}, sensitivity=0.76±0.14\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.76\pm 0.14$$\end{document} and specificity=0.77±0.05\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.77\pm 0.05$$\end{document}; and for the second, the best results were obtained for the 6th year of progression, also within two years: AUC=0.89±0.03\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.89\pm 0.03$$\end{document}, sensitivity=0.84±0.11\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.84\pm 0.11$$\end{document}, and specificity=0.81±0.05\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.81\pm 0.05$$\end{document}.

The main objectives of this study were to use a feature engineering approach to incorporate clinical expert knowledge prior to applying machine learning techniques, and to assess the impact of the approach on model complexity and performance. Four machine learning models were trained to predict mortality with a severe asthma case study. Experiments to select fewer input features based on a discriminative score showed low to moderate precision for discovering clinically meaningful triplets, indicating that discriminative score alone cannot replace clinical input. When compared to baseline machine learning models, we found a decrease in model complexity with use of fewer features informed by discriminative score and filtering of laboratory features with clinical input. We also found a small difference in performance for the mortality prediction task when comparing baseline ML models to models that used filtered features. Encoding demographic and triplet information in ML models with filtered features appeared to show performance improvements from the baseline. These findings indicated that the use of filtered features may reduce model complexity, and with little impact on performance.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,15,,2020,2020-04-23 00:00:00,"Kenneth D Roe, Vibhu Jawa, X.

A panel regression model analyzes trade between Russia and its 15 top trading partners, exploring both direct and indirect effects. The analysis focuses on how accumulated foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange rate fluctuations mediate these relationships. The findings reveal that global geopolitical instability decrease Russian trade by 0.0558. Interestingly, this negative impact is partially mediated by a decrease in FDI (-0.0805). This aligns with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, which show a significant negative effect of global geopolitical instability on FDI (-1.209). This suggests that FDI acts as a key transmitter of the negative effects of global instability on Russian trade. The role of exchange rate fluctuations, however, is more complex. While the Sobel Test indicated a negative indirect effect, the SEM analysis shows a positive indirect effect through exchange rate fluctuations on trade. This suggests potentially countervailing effects of currency fluctuations, with depreciation potentially incentivizing exports while appreciation might make imports cheaper. The impact of country-specific geopolitical instability varies depending on the context. Industries like food products and textiles are significantly affected by geopolitical instability increase, while sectors such as fuels, metals and raw materials show resilience. Close trading partners are less affected by global instability but suffer from partner- specific instability. Geographically, Western Europe benefits from global instability but faces challenges from partner-specific instability, contrasting with Eastern Europe and Asia. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how geopolitical instability, mediated by FDI and exchange rates, shapes Russia's trade performance.",International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology,journal,dc8f13a2-4e40-4171-8418-7e5648ecf441,International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology (IJISRT),,,,2024,2024-08-03 00:00:00,Pavel Talamanov,2200259444,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9b0bcfe881b6c90f76dfe7a913b0e022682ceb5,"Economics, Political Science",2200259444,['JournalArticle'],929.0,17.0

In this age of Industry 4.0 the fruit sorting is an important part in the food processing wherein this work plays a vital role. In this study, a solution for the detection and classification of apple fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. Deep learning models offer promise for automating disease identification using fruit images, but encounter obstacles such as therequirement for extensive training data, computational complexity, and the risk of overfitting. This study introduces an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture aimed at addressing these challenges by incorporating a reduced number of layers, thus alleviating computational burdens while maintaining performance. Additionally, augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are employed to diversify the training set without additional image acquisition. Our CNN model is specifically trained to identify common apple crop diseases like Scab, Rot, and Blotch. Rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness ofour model, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 95.37%. Significantly, our model demonstrates reduced storage requirements and faster execution times compared to existing deep CNN architectures, enabling deployment on handheld devices and resource-limited environments. While other CNN models may offer similar accuracy levels, our approach emphasizes efficiency and resource optimization, rendering it practical for real-world applications in agriculture. Furthermore, our CNN model exhibits resilience to environmental variations and imaging parameters, enhancing its applicability across diverse agricultural settings.

Viable computational methods that can facilitate tailored intervention while tolerating sequencing biases are in high demand. Here we propose a class of transparent and interpretable computational methods called integral genomic signature (iGenSig) analyses, that address the challenges of cross-dataset modeling through leveraging information redundancies within high-dimensional genomic features, averaging feature weights to prevent overweighing, and extracting unbiased genomic information from large tumor cohorts. Using genomic dataset of chemical perturbations, we develop a battery of iGenSig models for predicting cancer drug responses, and validate the models using independent cell-line and clinical datasets. The iGenSig models for five drugs demonstrate predictive values in six clinical studies, among which the Erlotinib and 5-FU models significantly predict therapeutic responses in three studies, offering clinically relevant insights into their inverse predictive signature pathways. Together, iGenSig provides a computational framework to facilitate tailored cancer therapy based on multi-omics data.

Mechanistically, this involves signal-processing through a complex network of molecular interactions that govern transcription factor activity patterns. Computer simulations of the information flow through this network could help predict cellular responses in health and disease. Here we develop a recurrent neural network framework constrained by prior knowledge of the signaling network with ligand-concentrations as input and transcription factor-activity as output. Applied to synthetic data, it predicts unseen test-data (Pearson correlation r = 0.98) and the effects of gene knockouts (r = 0.8). We stimulate macrophages with 59 different ligands, with and without the addition of lipopolysaccharide, and collect transcriptomics data. The framework predicts this data under cross-validation (r = 0.8) and knockout simulations suggest a role for RIPK1 in modulating the lipopolysaccharide response. This work demonstrates the feasibility of genome-scale simulations of intracellular signaling. Many diseases are caused by disruptions to the network of biochemical reactions that allow cells to respond to external signals.

In this context, the present research comes to connect the local sustainable tourism development with the sporting events, and to come up with relevant proposals for the reference area, but also for their generalization in the whole tourist areas. Based on the research purpose, a quantitative research was conducted on a sample of 448 residents, randomly selected from a sampling frame. Several scales from previous studies were used to collect primary data, and they were adapted according to the research purpose. Research findings indicate that the acceptance of sustainable tourism development through sports can be predicted by several variables, such as the economic impact (b = 0.343), residents’ attitude towards sports events (b = 0.287), and citizens’ tendency to entrepreneurship (b = 0.113). Additionally, sports events affect the tendency of citizens towards entrepreneurship (r = 0.519, p < 0.01). In conclusion, the impact of sports events is multiple, and it affects many aspects of a tourism destination, and the effect of sports events on the destination is connected with the tendency of citizens towards entrepreneurship related to sports events.",Sustainability,journal,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,,2022,2022-04-07 00:00:00,"G.

This ecosystem makes its presence felt in every aspect of our lives, along with all other emerging technologies. Unfortunately, despite the significant benefits brought by the IoT, the increased attack surface built upon it has become more critical than ever. Devices have limited resources and are not typically created with security features. Lately, a trend of botnet threats transitioning to the IoT environment has been observed, and an army of infected IoT devices can expand quickly and be used for effective attacks. Therefore, identifying proper solutions for securing IoT systems is currently an important and challenging research topic. Machine learning-based approaches are a promising alternative, allowing the identification of abnormal behaviors and the detection of attacks. This paper proposes an anomaly-based detection solution that uses unsupervised deep learning techniques to identify IoT botnet activities. An empirical evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on both balanced and unbalanced datasets to assess its threat detection capability. False-positive rate reduction and its impact on the detection system are also analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison with other unsupervised learning approaches is included. The experimental results reveal the performance of the proposed detection method.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2021,2021-08-04 00:00:00,"Ioana Apostol, Marius Preda, Constantin Nila, I.

Discrimination between these varieties, historically done by ampelography, is done in recent decades mostly by genetic analysis. However, when aiming to identify archaeobotanical remains, which are mostly charred with extremely low genomic preservation, the application of the genomic approach is rarely successful. As a result, variety-level identification of most grape remains is currently prevented. Because grape pips are highly polymorphic, several attempts were made to utilize their morphological diversity as a classification tool, mostly using 2D image analysis technics. Here, we present a highly accurate varietal classification tool using an innovative and accessible 3D seed scanning approach. The suggested classification methodology is machine-learning-based, applied with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique. This methodology achieved classification results of 91% to 93% accuracy in average when trained by fresh or charred seeds to test fresh or charred seeds, respectively. We show that when classifying 8 groups, enhanced accuracy levels can be achieved using a ""tournament"" approach. Future development of this new methodology can lead to an effective seed classification tool, significantly improving the fields of archaeobotany, as well as general taxonomy.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,,2021,2021-06-30 00:00:00,"Vlad Landa, Yekaterina Shapira, Michal David, A.

Sustainability awareness has been gaining attention from many international organizations, resulting in the rise of sports tourism that incorporates sustainability. Therefore, the development of a valid and applicable sustainable sports tourism (SST) assessment model is an important task. In this study, a hybrid Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) model is proposed to measure the development performance of SST. The aims of this study include developing a SST assessment framework, identifying the mutual influential relationships among attributes, generating attribute influence weights, and calculating the performance of the evaluated items. The proposed model is divided into three stages. First, a cause-and-effect diagram is generated using the Grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (GDEMATEL) to describe the interactions and feedback among the attributes. Then, the GDEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (GDANP) is applied to generate the influence weights of the attributes and their rankings. Finally, the expanded Probability-based Grey Relational Analysis (expanded PGRA) was applied to calculate the performance of the evaluated items and to determine the gap between evaluated items and the aspiration level. This study improves the original PGRA technique by introducing the concept of aspiration level into the PGRA calculation process, thereby replacing the traditional concept of “relative satisfaction” with “aspiration level”. In addition, the expanded PGRA can assess a single rated item without being limited to at least two items. We used the Sun Moon Lake Scenic Area in Taiwan as a model demonstration. The results show that the top three attributes that need to be strengthened are disease prevention and treatment, local social welfare and protection, and sports diversity. In the Sun Moon Lake, intersection control should be set up to ensure the health status of visitors and local residents. In addition to epidemic prevention, more measures and behaviors should be developed to deal with tourism diseases. We suggested that subsidies be provided to local residents to rebuild the fences around their homes to avoid disturbances caused by the influx of tourists. Moreover, the local government can create more sports events with special characteristics that can attract tourists to come again and again.",Sustainability,journal,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,4214,13,,2021,2021-04-10 00:00:00,"Chin-Cheng Yang, Chih-Chien Shen, Yu-Sheng Lin, Huai-Wei Lo, Jiaqi Wu","46962505, 2976893, 2107930791, 144556608, 2115785222",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d5353d433e4b0e03d106ff73072c24a96b61709,"Business, Computer Science, Environmental Science",46962505,,15.0,32.0

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), as well as adoptive T-cell therapies outside the setting of allo-HSCT, have been approved for distinct haematologic malignancies producing durable responses in otherwise untreatable patients. Despite recent advances, immunotherapies do not benefit most patients, due to resistance or lack of response, and are only approved in specific settings. Moreover, immunotherapies are expensive and may produce severe immune related adverse reactions. Combination therapy complicates the picture and requires further evaluation. This review considers the current status and future perspectives of ICIs and BiTEs approved for haematological malignancies by analysing their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT).

Methods We included 120 patients (positive recurrence = 46 and negative recurrence = 74) referred for PET scanning as a routine part of their care. All patients had a biopsy-proven NSCLC. Nine segmentation methods were applied to each image, including manual delineation, K-means (KM), watershed, fuzzy-C-mean, region-growing, local active contour (LAC), and iterative thresholding (IT) with 40, 45, and 50% thresholds. Diverse image discretizations, both without a filter and with different wavelet decompositions, were applied to PET images. Overall, 6741 radiomic features were extracted from each image (749 radiomic features from each segmented area). Non-parametric empirical Bayes (NPEB) ComBat harmonization was used to harmonize the features. Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) with L1 regularization For feature selection and Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) with fivefold nested cross-validation was performed using StratifiedKFold with ‘n_splits’ set to 5 to predict recurrence in NSCLC patients and assess the impact of ComBat harmonization on the outcome. Results From 749 extracted radiomic features, 206 (27%) and 389 (51%) features showed excellent reliability (ICC ≥ 0.90) against segmentation method variation before and after NPEB ComBat harmonization, respectively. Among all, 39 features demonstrated poor reliability, which declined to 10 after ComBat harmonization. The 64 fixed bin widths (without any filter) and wavelets (LLL)-based radiomic features set achieved the best performance in terms of robustness against diverse segmentation techniques before and after ComBat harmonization. The first-order and GLRLM and also first-order and NGTDM feature families showed the largest number of robust features before and after ComBat harmonization, respectively. In terms of predicting recurrence in NSCLC, our findings indicate that using ComBat harmonization can significantly enhance machine learning outcomes, particularly improving the accuracy of watershed segmentation, which initially had fewer reliable features than manual contouring. Following the application of ComBat harmonization, the majority of cases saw substantial increase in sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion Radiomic features are vulnerable to different segmentation methods. ComBat harmonization might be considered a solution to overcome the poor reliability of radiomic features.

The images were resliced, resampled, and realigned. In the next step, tumors were segmented semi-automatically into subregions including whole tumor, edema region, core tumor, enhancing region, and necrotic region. A total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from each subregion. The data were divided randomly into training and testing sets. A deep learning-based data augmentation method (CTGAN) was implemented to synthesize 200 datasets. A total of 18 classifiers were used to distinguish two genotypes of grade 4 astrocytomas. The best discriminatory power was obtained from core tumor regions overlaid on post-contrast T1 using the K-best feature selection algorithm and a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier. Abstract This study aimed to investigate the potential of quantitative radiomic data extracted from conventional MR images in discriminating IDH-mutant grade 4 astrocytomas from IDH-wild-type glioblastomas (GBMs). A cohort of 57 treatment-naïve patients with IDH-mutant grade 4 astrocytomas (n = 23) and IDH-wild-type GBMs (n = 34) underwent anatomical imaging on a 3T MR system with standard parameters. Post-contrast T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images were co-registered. A semi-automatic segmentation approach was used to generate regions of interest (ROIs) from different tissue components of neoplasms. A total of 1050 radiomic features were extracted from each image. The data were split randomly into training and testing sets. A deep learning-based data augmentation method (CTGAN) was implemented to synthesize 200 datasets from the training sets. A total of 18 classifiers were used to distinguish two genotypes of grade 4 astrocytomas. From generated data using 80% training set, the best discriminatory power was obtained from core tumor regions overlaid on post-contrast T1 using the K-best feature selection algorithm and a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier (AUC = 0.93, accuracy = 0.92, sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.86, PR_AUC = 0.92). Similarly, high diagnostic performances were obtained from original and generated data using 50% and 30% training sets.

Given the recent advances in light microscopy and the need for accurate and high-throughput analysis of cells, automated algorithms have been developed for segmenting and analyzing the cells in microscopy images. Nevertheless, accurate, generic and robust whole-cell segmentation is still a persisting need to precisely quantify its morphological properties, phenotypes and sub-cellular dynamics. We present a single-channel whole cell segmentation algorithm. We use markers that stain the whole cell, but with less staining in the nucleus, and without using a separate nuclear stain. We show the utility of our approach in microscopy images of cell cultures in a wide variety of conditions. Our algorithm uses a deep learning approach to learn and predict locations of the cells and their nuclei, and combines that with thresholding and watershed-based segmentation. We trained and validated our approach using different sets of images, containing cells stained with various markers and imaged at different magnifications. Our approach achieved a 86% similarity to ground truth segmentation when identifying and separating cells. The proposed algorithm is able to automatically segment cells from single channel images using a variety of markers and magnifications.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,,19,,2018,2018-10-03 00:00:00,"Yousef Al-Kofahi, A.

We describe a tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) method for highly multiplexed immuno-fluorescence imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. t-CyCIF generates up to 60-plex images using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high-dimensional representation. t-CyCIF requires no specialized instruments or reagents and is compatible with super-resolution imaging; we demonstrate its application to quantifying signal transduction cascades, tumor antigens and immune markers in diverse tissues and tumors.

Here, we present advances in segmentation algorithms and analytical tools for multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), a platform that enables iterative staining of over 60 antibodies on a single tissue section. These refinements have enabled a comprehensive analysis of tuft cell number, distribution, and protein expression profiles as a function of anatomical location and physiological perturbations. Based solely on DCLK1 immunoreactivity, tuft cell numbers were similar throughout the mouse small intestine and colon. However, multiple subsets of tuft cells were uncovered when protein coexpression signatures were examined, including two new intestinal tuft cell markers, Hopx and EGFR phosphotyrosine 1068. Furthermore, we identified dynamic changes in tuft cell number, composition, and protein expression associated with fasting and refeeding and after introduction of microbiota to germ-free mice. These studies provide a foundational framework for future studies of intestinal tuft cell regulation and demonstrate the utility of our improved MxIF computational methods and workflow for understanding cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues in normal and disease states.",JCI Insight,journal,e6c392b4-b4fc-409c-8ff2-c490c0407611,JCI insight,,2 11,,2017,2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Eliot T.

We can reach pressures in the 100-TPa regime on the Hugoniot, or ∼500-GPa regime along a quasi-isentrope, allowing the sample under study to remain solid, at planetary interior pressures. We observe RT stabilization (i) at an ablation front; (ii) in the presence of a strongly radiative shock; and (iii) in a unique regime of quasi-isentropic, high pressure, solid-state material flow, where the material strength significantly affects the evolution of a hydrodynamically unstable interface. The Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability occurs at an interface between two fluids of differing density during an acceleration. These instabilities can occur in very diverse settings, from inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions over spatial scales of ∼10−3−10−1 cm (10–1,000 μm) to supernova explosions at spatial scales of ∼1012 cm and larger. We describe experiments and techniques for reducing (“stabilizing”) RT growth in high-energy density (HED) settings on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Three unique regimes of stabilization are described: (i) at an ablation front, (ii) behind a radiative shock, and (iii) due to material strength. For comparison, we also show results from nonstabilized “classical” RT instability evolution in HED regimes on the NIF. Examples from experiments on the NIF in each regime are given. These phenomena also occur in several astrophysical scenarios and planetary science [Drake R (2005) Plasma Phys Controlled Fusion 47:B419–B440; Dahl TW, Stevenson DJ (2010) Earth Planet Sci Lett 295:177–186].",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,journal,bb95bf2e-8383-4748-bf9d-d6906d091085,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,18233 - 18238,116,,2018,2018-06-26 00:00:00,"B.

It leverages the extraordinary data-fitting capacity of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) while preserving high interpretability and robustness by embedding widely applicable physical laws such as the law of mass action and the Arrhenius law. In this paper, we further developed Bayesian CRNN to not only reconstruct but also quantify the uncertainty of chemical kinetic models from data. Two methods, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and variational inference, were used to perform the Bayesian CRNN, with the latter mainly adopted for its speed. We demonstrated the capability of Bayesian CRNN in the kinetic uncertainty quantification of different types of chemical systems and discussed the importance of embedding physical laws in data-driven modeling. Finally, we discussed the adaptation of Bayesian CRNN for incomplete measurements and model mixing for global uncertainty quantification.","Physical Chemistry, Chemical Physics - PCCP",journal,63ed87ae-e104-4cfe-91c9-eb1f2f9ed5b0,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,,,,2023,2023-01-20 00:00:00,"Qiaofeng Li, Huaibo Chen, Benjamin C.

Despite this, coffee remains vulnerable to several plant diseases that may result in significant financial losses for the agricultural industry. Traditionally, plant diseases are detected by expert observation with the naked eye. Traditional methods for managing such diseases are arduous, time-consuming, and costly, especially when dealing with expansive territories. Using a model based on transfer learning and deep learning model, we present in this study a technique for classifying Robusta coffee leaf disease photos into healthy and unhealthy classes. The MobileNetV2 network serves as the model since its network design is simple. Therefore, it is likely that the suggested approach will be deployed further on mobile devices. In addition, the transfer learning and experimental learning paradigms. Because it is such a lightweight net, the MobileNetV2 system serves as the foundational model. Results on Robusta coffee leaf disease datasets indicate that the suggested technique can achieve a high level of accuracy, up to 99.93%. The accuracy of other architectures besides MobileNetV2 such as DenseNet169 is 99.74%, ResNet50 architecture is 99.41%, and InceptionResNetV2 architecture is 99.09%.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,"Y.

Food image classification is a challenging problem, the solution of which can be of great benefit to many real-world applications such as nutrition and allergy estimation. Most of the previous studies proposed to use variations of convolutional neural networks to tackle the problem. However, due to the limited number of annotated food image datasets, there is still some room for improvement, especially in terms of accuracy and speed. Generally speaking, neural networks trained to solve image classification problems on a small dataset benefit from utilizing the weights of the networks that have been pre-trained on a large image classification dataset such as ImageNet. In this paper, we compare the trade-offs between training networks from scratch, deploying pre-trained networks as feature extractors, and fine-tuning the networks for Thai food image classification. By utilizing Transfer Learning with EfficientNetV1, we were able to achieve higher accuracy for Thai Food Image Classification on the largest publicly available Thai food image dataset, THFOOD-50. In particular, our proposed method improves upon the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art method from 84.06% to 91.49% while maintaining the speed for the prediction at 103 ms and 1205 ms for GPU and CPU, respectively.",Engineering Journal,journal,363b13a4-48da-4c84-80db-f138f0e981a0,Engineering Journal,,,,2022,2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Sirawit Ittisoponpisan, Chayanat Kaipan, Somporn Ruang-on, Rattayagon Thaiphan, Kritaphat Songsri-in","13394408, 2192457036, 2187087969, 51360797, 1412969516",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d97f2bc35be350d8c420bfcb32a6699f85a6d3a8,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science",13394408,,5.0,53.0

To protect birds and the diversity of species on earth, it is urgent to build an automatic bird image recognition system. Therefore, this paper assesses the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning models on image recognition. Also, the help-ability of transfer learning in the field of image recognition is tested to evaluate the best model for bird recognition systems. Three groups of classifiers for bird recognition were constructed, namely, classifiers based on the traditional machine learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning-based convolutional neural networks. After experiments, these three classifiers showed significant differences in the classification effect on the Kaggle-180-birds dataset. The experimental results finally prove that deep learning is more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms in image recognition as the number of bird species increases. Besides, the obtained results show that when the sample data is small, transfer learning can help the deep neural network classifier to improve classification accuracy.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,,2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,"Mohammed Alswaitti, Liao Zihao, Waleed Alomoush, Ayat Alrosan, Khalid A.

This could be solved through automatic identification and diagnoses using deep learning. However, this technology is not yet explored and examined in the case of peanut leaf spot disease due to some aspects, such as the availability of sufficient data to be used for training and testing the model. This study is intended to explore the use of pre-trained visual geometry group–16 (VGG16), visual geometry group–19 (VGG19), InceptionV3, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 architectures and deep learning optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Momentum, adaptive moment estimation (Adam), root mean square propagation (RMSProp), and adaptive gradient algorithm (Adagrad) in creating a model that can identify leaf spot disease by using a total of 1,000 images of leaves captured using a mobile camera. Confusion matrix was used to assess the accuracy and precision of the results. The result of the study shows that DenseNet-169 trained using SGD with momentum, Adam, and RMSProp attained the highest accuracy of 98%, while DenseNet-169 trained using RMSProp achieved the highest precision of 98% among pre-trained deep convolutional neural network architectures.

It has made a major contribution to medical image analysis as it overcomes the data scarcity problem as well as it saves time and hardware resources. However, transfer learning has been arbitrarily configured in the majority of studies. This review paper attempts to provide guidance for selecting a model and TL approaches for the medical image classification task. Methods 425 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from two databases, PubMed and Web of Science, published in English, up until December 31, 2020. Articles were assessed by two independent reviewers, with the aid of a third reviewer in the case of discrepancies. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for the paper selection and 121 studies were regarded as eligible for the scope of this review. We investigated articles focused on selecting backbone models and TL approaches including feature extractor, feature extractor hybrid, fine-tuning and fine-tuning from scratch. Results The majority of studies (n = 57) empirically evaluated multiple models followed by deep models (n = 33) and shallow (n = 24) models. Inception, one of the deep models, was the most employed in literature (n = 26). With respect to the TL, the majority of studies (n = 46) empirically benchmarked multiple approaches to identify the optimal configuration. The rest of the studies applied only a single approach for which feature extractor (n = 38) and fine-tuning from scratch (n = 27) were the two most favored approaches.

This is often achieved through integration: IoT is being integrated into billions of intelligent objects, commonly labeled “things,” from which the service collects various forms of data regarding both these “things” themselves as well as their environment. While IoT and IoT-powered decices can provide invaluable services in various fields, unauthorized access and inadvertent modification are potential issues of tremendous concern. In this paper, we present a process for resolving such IoT issues using adapted long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN). With this method, we utilize specialized deep learning (DL) methods to detect abnormal and/or suspect behavior in IoT systems. LSTM RNNs are adopted in order to construct a high-accuracy model capable of detecting suspicious behavior based on a dataset of IoT sensors readings. The model is evaluated using the Intel Labs dataset as a test domain, performing four different tests, and using three criteria: F1, Accuracy, and time. The results obtained here demonstrate that the LSTM RNN model we create is capable of detecting abnormal behavior in IoT systems with high accuracy.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,,2022,2022-04-01 00:00:00,"M.

Such models may be derived from data from various studies in the context of a meta‐analysis. We describe and propose approaches for assessing heterogeneity in predictor effects and predictions arising from models based on data from different sources. These methods are illustrated in a case study with patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, where we aim to predict 6‐month mortality based on individual patient data using meta‐analytic techniques (15 studies, n = 11 022 patients). The insights into various aspects of heterogeneity are important to develop better models and understand problems with the transportability of absolute risk predictions.",Statistics in Medicine,journal,6c8c2afc-7abf-4f41-a2ea-a673c67ab017,Statistics in Medicine,4290 - 4309,38,,2019,2019-08-02 00:00:00,"E.

Net benefit is an increasingly reported decision analytic measure that puts benefits and harms on the same scale. This is achieved by specifying an exchange rate, a clinical judgment of the relative value of benefits (such as detecting a cancer) and harms (such as unnecessary biopsy) associated with models, markers, and tests. The exchange rate can be derived by asking simple questions, such as the maximum number of patients a doctor would recommend for biopsy to find one cancer. As the answers to these sorts of questions are subjective, it is possible to plot net benefit for a range of reasonable exchange rates in a “decision curve.” For clinical prediction models, the exchange rate is related to the probability threshold to determine whether a patient is classified as being positive or negative for a disease. Net benefit is useful for determining whether basing clinical decisions on a model, marker, or test would do more good than harm. This is in contrast to traditional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are statistical abstractions not directly informative about clinical value. Recent years have seen an increase in practical applications of net benefit analysis to research data. This is a welcome development, since decision analytic techniques are of particular value when the purpose of a model, marker, or test is to help doctors make better clinical decisions.",British medical journal,journal,3048b449-a773-4256-9bb5-5e61fbb61e52,The BMJ,,352,,2016,2016-01-25 00:00:00,"A.

Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, 3194 SPECT thyroid images were collected for model training (n=2067), internal validation (n=514) and external validation (n=613). First, four pretrained DCNN models (AlexNet, ShuffleNetV2, MobileNetV3 and ResNet-34) for were tested multiple medical image classification of thyroid disease types (i.e., Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, thyroid tumor and normal thyroid). The best performing model was then subjected to fivefold cross-validation to further assess its performance, and the diagnostic performance of this model was compared with that of junior and senior nuclear medicine physicians. Finally, class-specific attentional regions were visualized with attention heatmaps using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Results Each of the four pretrained neural networks attained an overall accuracy of more than 0.85 for the classification of SPECT thyroid images. The improved ResNet-34 model performed best, with an accuracy of 0.944. For the internal validation set, the ResNet-34 model showed higher accuracy (p < 0.001) when compared to that of the senior nuclear medicine physician, with an improvement of nearly 10%. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.931 for the external dataset, a significantly higher accuracy than that of the senior physician (0.931 vs. 0.868, p < 0.001). Conclusion The DCNN-based model performed well in terms of diagnosing thyroid scintillation images. The DCNN model showed higher sensitivity and greater specificity in identifying Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid tumors compared to those of nuclear medicine physicians, illustrating the feasibility of deep learning models to improve the diagnostic efficiency for assisting clinicians.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,journal,baea33cc-0a71-4b2a-9f01-5071f7b1abc9,Frontiers in Endocrinology,,14,,2023,2023-08-11 00:00:00,"Huayi Zhao, C.

As a result, early detection was pertinent in preventing or minimizing the impact of this disease. In this study, different machine learning (ML) algorithms with a combination of scaling method, oversampling technique, and various feature selection approaches have been applied to make an efficient framework to classify TD. In addition, significant risk factors of TD were also identified in this proposed system. The dataset was collected from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository for this research. After that, in the preprocessing stage, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to resolve the imbalance class problem and robust scaling technique was used to scale the dataset. The Boruta, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches were used to select appropriate features. To train the model, we employed six different ML classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). The models were examined using a 5-fold CV. Different performance metrics were observed to compare the effectiveness of the algorithms. The system achieved the most accurate results using the RF classifier, with 99% accuracy.

Thyroid disease is a severe medical complaint that could be developed by high Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels or an infection in the thyroid tissues. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are two critical conditions caused by insufficient thyroid hormone production and excessive thyroid hormone production, respectively. Machine learning models can be used to precisely process the data generated from different medical sectors and to build a model to predict several diseases. In this paper, we use different machine-learning algorithms to predict hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Moreover, we identified the most significant features, which can be used to detect thyroid diseases more precisely. After completing the pre-processing and feature selection steps, we applied our modified and original data to several classification models to predict thyroidism. We found Random Forest (RF) is giving the maximum evaluation score in all sectors in our dataset, and Naive Bayes is performing very poorly. Moreover selecting the feature by using the feature importance method RF provides the best accuracy of 91.42%, precision of 92%, recall of 92% and F1-score of 92%. Further, by analyzing the characteristics and behavior of the dataset, we identified the most important features (TSH, T3, TT4, and FTI) of the dataset. In terms of accuracy and other performance evaluation criteria, this study could advocate the use of effective classifiers and features backed by machine learning algorithms to detect and diagnose thyroid disease. Finally, we did some explainability analysis of our best classifier to understand the internal black-box of our machine learning model and datasets. This study could further pave the way for the researcher as well as healthcare professionals to analyze thyroid disease in real time applications.",Human-Centric Intelligent Systems,journal,096a4eed-8279-4e94-abd3-1c0403372743,Human-Centric Intelligent Systems,211 - 231,3,,2023,2023-06-08 00:00:00,"M.

Unfortunately, 10%–40% of patients have primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy. TNF family genes play crucial roles in inflammation and immune regulation; however, the effects of TNF family genes on CD remain unclear. Methods CD expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Unsupervised clustering was then used to identify the gene subtypes in CD based on the expressions of TNF family genes. The features of the gene subtypes were characterized using functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses, and biomarkers of the gene subtypes were identified. Results Patients with CD were divided on the basis of unsupervised clustering into two gene subtypes: immune and metabolic. Gene subtype A was significantly correlated with leukocyte migration and cytokine interactions, whereas gene subtype B was associated with metabolic pathways. Whereas 89.5% of the patients in gene subtype B responded to infliximab, only 16.7% of patients in gene subtype A responded. In addition, a combination of interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), interleukin 6 (IL6), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) can effectively distinguish between gene subtypes A and B. Conclusion Comprehensive analyses of the TNF family genes may reveal the underlying pathogenesis of CD. The classification of subtypes may provide new ideas for the personalized treatment of patients with CD.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,13,,2022,2022-04-22 00:00:00,"Chenglin Ye, Sizhe Zhu, Jingping Yuan","80080655, 2110018754, 2150063854",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03327d34c5a42b422a0ce9596f4ca6c7767f1425,Medicine,80080655,['JournalArticle'],4.0,34.0

Validation of candidate biomarkers in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced experimental colitis model and ceRNA network in an HCT116 cell line was also an aim, along with purposing to reveal the pathogenesis of CD. Methods GSE102134 and GSE67106 datasets were obtained and used to screen the differentially expressed genes. WCGNA was applied to identify the relative model to construct the ceRNA network. Furthermore, the relationship between candidate gene and immune infiltration was investigated. Then, the expression of potential biomarkers was validated via qRT-PCR in a TNBS induced experimental colitis model. Finally, the ceRNA network was confirmed by RNAi experiments in an HCT116 cell line. Results The ceRNA network, consisting of four lncRNAs, four miRNAs, and eight mRNAs, was constructed and the ROC analysis showed four mRNAs (PTGS2, LPL, STAT1, and TRIB2) had high diagnostic accuracy (AUC>0.9). In addition, upregulated PTGS2 was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including Natural killer cells, exhausted T-cells, monocytes, and Dendritic cells. The outcome of this TNBS induced experimental colitis model verified that the expression of PTGS2 and mir-429 was consistent with results of previous bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the predicted ceRNA network MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 were validated via RNA interference. Knockout of MIR3142HG decreased the mRNA level of PTGS2, whereas inhibition of mir-429 increased the mRNA level of PTGS2 in the HCT116 cell line. Conclusion The exploration of the ceRNA network in this work might contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of CD. The constructed MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 ceRNA network may play a role in CD, and PTGS2 can be a potential immune-related biomarker in CD.",Journal of Inflammation Research,journal,2264e13c-a38e-4a95-ad47-1fd698d3fc68,Journal of Inflammation Research,6447 - 6459,14,,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,"Chenglin Ye, Sizhe Zhu, Jingping Yuan","80080655, 2110018754, 7998468",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a80c4f36fffb31d3ec222d31aba34a185d35e2d,"Biology, Medicine",80080655,['JournalArticle'],7.0,47.0

Baseline β7 expression does not impact αE induction or gene expression in T cells. Phospho-SMAD3 is increased in inflamed mucosa in IBD. Targeting interactions between α4β7 integrin and endothelial adhesion molecule MAdCAM-1 to inhibit lymphocyte migration to the gastrointestinal tract is an effective therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Following lymphocyte entry into the mucosa, a subset of these cells expresses αEβ7 integrin, which is expressed on proinflammatory lymphocytes, to increase cell retention. The factors governing lymphocyte migration into the intestinal mucosa and αE integrin expression in healthy subjects and IBD patients remain incompletely understood. We evaluated changes in factors involved in lymphocyte migration and differentiation within tissues. Both ileal and colonic tissue from active IBD patients showed upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1 at the gene and protein levels compared with healthy subjects and/or inactive IBD patients. β1 and β7 integrin expression on circulating lymphocytes was similar across groups. TGF-β1 treatment induced expression of αE on both β7+ and β7− T cells, suggesting that cells entering the mucosa independently of MAdCAM-1/α4β7 can become αEβ7+. ITGAE gene polymorphisms did not alter protein induction following TGF-β1 stimulation. Increased phospho-SMAD3, which is directly downstream of TGF-β, and increased TGF-β–responsive gene expression were observed in the colonic mucosa of IBD patients. Finally, in vitro stimulation experiments showed that baseline β7 expression had little effect on cytokine, chemokine, transcription factor, and effector molecule gene expression in αE+ and αE− T cells. These findings suggest cell migration to the gut mucosa may be altered in IBD and α4β7−, and α4β7+ T cells may upregulate αEβ7 in response to TGF-β once within the gut mucosa.",Journal of Immunology,journal,3456d2d7-a9b4-495f-a7a0-a238096ee07a,The Journal of Immunology Author Choice,2245 - 2254,207,,2021,2021-09-24 00:00:00,"M.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of CD, as indicated by the efficacy of anti-TNF-α therapy with infliximab (IFX). However, approximately 30–40% of CD patients fail to respond to IFX with still unclear underlying mechanisms. This study compares the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes from CD patients, who respond or non-respond to IFX. Under basal conditions, the mRNA for the cytokines TNFα, IL-23, IL-1β and the chemokines CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES and CCL2/MCP-1 was up-regulated in monocytes from non-responders than responders. The expression of the same cytokines and CCL2/MCP-1 was higher in non-responders also upon LPS treatment. Moreover, higher secretion of TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ and IL-2 proteins occurred in the supernatants of LPS-treated non-responders cells. Resistance to IFX in CD may result from a transcriptional dysregulation of circulating monocytes, leading to hyperactivation of pro-inflammatory pathways. Monocytes’ cytokine profile may thus represent a predictive marker of response to IFX. Monocytes were isolated from blood samples of 19 CD patients (11 responders, 8 non-responders) and incubated with or without LPS. Cytokine profiles were assessed by RT-qPCR and, in the supernatants, by ELISA assay.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,,2020,2020-07-22 00:00:00,"F.

Nevertheless, it is unclear how gut glycosylation contributes to the HIV-associated microbial translocation and inflammation that persist despite viral suppression and contribute to the development of several comorbidities. We examined terminal ileum, right colon, and sigmoid colon biopsies from HIV-infected virally-suppressed individuals and found that gut glycomic patterns are associated with distinct microbial compositions and differential levels of chronic inflammation and HIV persistence. In particular, high levels of the pro-inflammatory hypo-sialylated T-antigen glycans and low levels of the anti-inflammatory fucosylated glycans were associated with higher abundance of glycan-degrading microbial species (in particular, Bacteroides vulgatus) , a less diverse microbiome, higher levels of inflammation, and higher levels of ileum-associated HIV DNA. These findings are linked to the activation of the inflammasome-mediating eIF2 signaling pathway. Our study thus provides the first proof-of-concept evidence that a previously unappreciated factor, gut glycosylation, is a force that may impact the vicious cycle between HIV infection, microbial translocation, and chronic inflammation.",Mucosal Immunology,journal,592eea92-39cd-4609-a088-641ce5e32a13,Mucosal Immunology,753 - 766,13,,2020,2020-03-09 00:00:00,"L.

It is becoming apparent that epigenetic factors are significantly associated with the development of the disease. DNA methylation remains the most studied epigenetic modification, and hypermethylation of gene promoters is associated with gene silencing. Methods DNA methylation alterations may contribute to the many complex diseases development by regulating the interplay between external and internal environmental factors and gene transcriptional expression. In this study, we used 15 tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), originally identified in colon cancer, to detect promoter methylation in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD). Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing analyses were performed to assess methylation level of TSGs in CD patients. Results We found 6 TSGs (sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP5, TFPI2, Sox17, and GATA4) are robustly hypermethylated in CD patient samples. Bisulfite sequencing analysis confirmed the methylation levels of the sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP5, TFPI2, Sox17, and GATA4 promoters in the representative CD patient samples. Conclusions In this study, the promoter hypermethylation of the TSGs observed indicates that CD exhibits specific DNA methylation signatures with potential clinical applications for the noninvasive diagnosis of IBD and the prognosis for patients with IBD.",Intestinal Research,journal,02c07c77-4178-40dc-9078-33103ee6bbe7,Intestinal Research,297 - 305,18,,2020,2020-02-07 00:00:00,"Tae-Oh Kim, Yu Kyeong Han, J.

No study has yet evaluated the effects of applying the water supply adjustment standard (Standard) and activating the reservoir emergency storage in response to extreme drought. The main objective is to assess the effects of applying Standard and activating emergency storage in meeting the water demand under extreme drought at six multipurpose reservoirs (Andong, Gimcheon-Buhang, Gunwi, Hapcheon, Imha, and Milyang) in the Nakdong River Basin, South Korea. We built a reservoir simulation model (HEC-ResSim), determined the extreme drought scenarios, and emergency storage capacity. We evaluated three reservoir operation cases (general operation, regular Standard, and revised Standard) from 2011 to 2100. The results show that applying the Standard and activating the emergency storage are effective in meeting the future water demand during extreme drought. In conclusion, we need to secure 110 million cubic meters (MCM) (Hapcheon reservoir) and 8 MCM (Gunwi reservoir) of water to reduce the number of days in the emergency stage. This research serves as a fundamental study that can help establish Standard and emergency storage activation criteria for other multipurpose reservoirs in preparation for extreme drought.",Water,journal,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,,2022,2022-10-14 00:00:00,"Heechan Chae, J.

Machine-learning tools have the potential to improve groundwater prediction, thus enabling resource planners to: (1) anticipate water quality in unsampled areas or depth zones; (2) design targeted monitoring programs; (3) inform groundwater protection strategies; and (4) evaluate the sustainability of groundwater sources of drinking water. This paper proposes a machine-learning approach to groundwater prediction with the following characteristics: (i) the use of a regression-based approach to predict full groundwater images based on sequences of monthly groundwater maps; (ii) strategic automatic feature selection (both local and global features) using extreme gradient boosting; and (iii) the use of a multiplicity of machine-learning techniques (extreme gradient boosting, multivariate linear regression, random forests, multilayer perceptron and support vector regression). Of these techniques, support vector regression consistently performed best in terms of minimizing root mean square error and mean absolute error. Furthermore, including a global feature obtained from a Gaussian Mixture Model produced models with lower error than the best which could be obtained with local geographical features.",Algorithms,journal,e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,300,13,,2020,2020-11-17 00:00:00,"Eslam A.

The removal of barriers may be different for each country or region, as each differs greatly in terms of politics, economy and social and cultural awareness. This paper addresses the complex problem of removing dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs. We demonstrate the scales of the changes, including their major ecological, economic, and social impacts. Arguments and approaches to this problem vary across states and regions, depending on the political system, economy and culture, as confirmed by the qualitative and quantitative intensities of the dam removal process and its global geographical variation. The results indicate that the removal of dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs applies predominantly to smaller structures (< 2.5 m). The existing examples provide an important conclusion that dams and reservoirs should be considered with regard to the interrelations between people and the environment. Decisions to deconstruct hydraulic engineering structures (or, likewise, to construct them) have to be applied with scrutiny. Furthermore, all decision-making processes have to be consistent and unified and thus developed to improve the lack of strategies currently implemented across world.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,,2020,2020-11-05 00:00:00,"M.

Left unnoticed and untreated, the deterioration in a health condition could even result in mortality. If it can be detected early, with proper treatment, undesirable outcomes can be avoided. Until now, the gold standard is the invasive way of measuring blood pressure (BP) using a catheter. Additionally, the cuff-based and noninvasive methods are too cumbersome or inconvenient for frequent measurement of BP. With the advancement of sensor technology, signal processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms, researchers are trying to find the perfect relationships between biomedical signals and changes in BP. This paper is a literature review of the studies conducted on the cuffless noninvasive measurement of BP using biomedical signals. Relevant articles were selected using specific criteria, then traditional techniques for BP measurement were discussed along with a motivation for cuffless measurement use of biomedical signals and machine learning algorithms. The review focused on the progression of different noninvasive cuffless techniques rather than comparing performance among different studies. The literature survey concluded that the use of deep learning proved to be the most accurate among all the cuffless measurement techniques. On the other side, this accuracy has several disadvantages, such as lack of interpretability, computationally extensive, standard validation protocol, and lack of collaboration with health professionals. Additionally, the continuing work by researchers is progressing with a potential solution for these challenges. Finally, future research directions have been provided to encounter the challenges.",Bioengineering,journal,103075b0-1b66-4b69-9c47-f54875634fba,Bioengineering,,10,,2022,2022-12-24 00:00:00,"M. M. R.

In this work, we show that FHE schemes suitable for arithmetic circuits (e.g. BGV or BFV) have a similar performance as FHE schemes for non-arithmetic circuits (TFHE) in basic comparison tasks such as less-than, maximum and minimum operations. Our implementation of the less-than function in the HElib library is up to 3 times faster than the prior work based on BGV/BFV.

In this paper, we develop two protocols for privately evaluating decision trees and random forests. We operate in the standard two-party setting where the server holds a model (either a tree or a forest), and the client holds an input (a feature vector). At the conclusion of the protocol, the client learns only the model’s output on its input and a few generic parameters concerning the model; the server learns nothing. The first protocol we develop provides security against semi-honest adversaries. We then give an extension of the semi-honest protocol that is robust against malicious adversaries. We implement both protocols and show that both variants are able to process trees with several hundred decision nodes in just a few seconds and a modest amount of bandwidth. Compared to previous semi-honest protocols for private decision tree evaluation, we demonstrate a tenfold improvement in computation and bandwidth.",IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,journal,166fd2b5-a928-4a98-a449-3b90935cc101,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,335 - 355,2016,,2016,2016-10-01 00:00:00,"David J.

This work demonstrates a new hollow core optical fiber based on a different guiding mechanism, which confines light with a cladding made of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material through total internal reflection. We show that the addition of a layer of ENZ material coating (e.g. indium tin oxide layer) significantly reduces the loss of the waveguide compared to the structure without the ENZ layer. We also show that the propagation loss of the ENZ hollow core fiber can be further improved by integrating ENZ materials with lower loss. This study presents a novel type of hollow core fiber, and can find advanced in-fiber photonic applications such as laser surgery/spectroscopy, novel gas-filled/discharge laser, in-fiber molecular/gas sensing, and low-latency optical fiber communication.",Nanophotonics,journal,f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1025 - 1031,13,,2024,2024-03-01 00:00:00,"Leon Zhang, Stuart Love, Aleksei Anopchenko, H.

Up until now, no discussion of phase transitions of nodal lines in photonic crystals using the Euler class has been reported, despite the fact that the Euler class and topological phase transition have recently been addressed in metallic or acoustic crystals. Here, we show how the deformation of a photonic crystal causes topological phase transitions in the nodal lines, and the Euler class can be used to theoretically predict the nodal lines’ stability based on the non-Abelian topological charge theory. Specifically, by manipulating the separation between the two single diamond structures and the extent of structural distortion, we numerically demonstrate the topological transition of nodal lines, e.g., from nodal lines to nodal rings. We then demonstrate that the range of surface states is strongly influenced by the topological phase transition of nodal lines. Moreover, the Zak phase was used to explain the surface states’ existence.",Nanophotonics,journal,f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1079 - 1089,13,,2024,2024-02-23 00:00:00,"Haedong Park, Alexander Jones, Minkyung Kim, S.

Despite remarkable progress, dynamically tunable metasurface holography in the visible band has rarely been reported due to limited available tuning methods. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate a thermally tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanofin based binary-phase metasurface, which generates holographic information in the visible varying with temperature. The insulator-to-metal phase transition in VO2 nanofins allows two independent binary-phase holograms generated by machine learning to be encoded in the respective phases of VO2 and switched under thermal regulation. By elaborately designing the dimensions and compensated phase of VO2 nanofins, high-quality images are reconstructed at corresponding temperatures under appropriate chiral illumination. In contrast, much poorer images are produced under inappropriate chiral illumination. We further demonstrate the advantage of applying the VO2 phase-compensated metasurface in high-security digital encryption, where two desired character combinations are read out with appropriate excitations and temperatures, whereas one identical fraudulent message is received with inappropriate excitations. Our design approach offers a new and efficient method to realize tunable metasurfaces, which is promisingly adopted in dynamic display, information encryption, optical anti-counterfeiting, etc.",Nanophotonics,journal,f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1109 - 1117,13,,2024,2024-02-21 00:00:00,"Yuan Liao, Yulong Fan, Dangyuan Lei","2287650011, 2252357288, 2124526207",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21004e072bc910d007350615765b2f6bf49ac5e8,"Engineering, Materials Science, Medicine, Physics",2287650011,['JournalArticle'],14.0,46.0

Instead of using the conventional approach that only the dipolar plasmonic mode is considered, we calculate the electric field enhancement in the nanometre sized gap, by taking account of the higher order modes in one gold sphere, which couples to the dipolar mode of the other sphere. The experimental confirmation is performed by gap-dependent tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) measurements. The photoluminescence and Raman enhancement are both observed with different growing trends as the gap width decreases. Red-shift of the background spectra is observed and implies the increasing coupling between the nanospheres.

This study aims to experimentally demonstrate ultrafast acousto-optic phenomena in the broad NIR spectral range of 0.77–1.1 eV (1130–1610 nm). Hundreds of GHz of light modulation are revealed in an all-optical configuration by combining ultrafast optical spectroscopy and light–sound conversion in 10–20 nm-thick bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) van der Waals thin films. The modified optical transition energy and the line shape in the NIR band indicate phonon–photon interactions, resulting in a modulation of optical characteristics by the photoexcited interlayer vibrations in Bi2Se3. This all-optical, ultrafast acousto-optic modulation approach may open avenues for next-generation nanophotonic applications, including optical communications and processing, due to the synergistic combination of large-area capability, high photo-responsivity, and frequency tunability in the NIR spectral range.",Nanophotonics,journal,f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1059 - 1068,13,,2024,2024-02-02 00:00:00,"Tae Gwan Park, Chaeyoon Kim, Eonseok Oh, Hong Ryeol Na, Seung-Hyun Chun, Sunghun Lee, Fabian Rotermund","50383138, 2189082283, 102450411, 1658083457, 2237902493, 2237941665, 2237844352",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c600818b4108089e57e391c8f8e467bc88de7741,"Medicine, Physics",50383138,['JournalArticle'],1.0,55.0

However, the characteristics of the interface of the lateral heterostructure, determining the electronic band structure and alignment at the heterojunction region, have rarely been studied due to the limited spatial resolution of nondestructive analysis systems. In this study, we investigated the confined phonons resulting from the phonon-disorder scattering process involving multiple disorders at the lateral heterostructure interface of MoS2–WS2 to prove the consequences of disorder-mediated deformation in the band structure. Moreover, we directly observed variations in the metal composition of the multi-disordered nanoscale alloy Mo1−x W x S2, consisting of atomic vacancies, crystal edges, and distinct nanocrystallites.

We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are ωB97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and ωB97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies.","Physical Chemistry, Chemical Physics - PCCP",journal,63ed87ae-e104-4cfe-91c9-eb1f2f9ed5b0,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,"

The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes’ demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons. Methods We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy. Results The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p < 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.50). Conclusions These results suggest that cultures of concussion non-disclosure can develop in any population where disclosure is perceived as having undesirable consequences, not just athletic populations. Concussion researchers and practitioners should devote more attention to the perceived cost-benefit structures that create concussion non-disclosure to address this crucial public health issue more effectively.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,14,,2019,2019-05-01 00:00:00,"C.

A condition assessment framework that utilizes AI and sensor data is an important part of such an autonomous control system. A nuclear power plant has various structures, systems, and components (SSCs) such as piping-equipment that carries coolant to the reactor. Piping systems can degrade over time because of flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion. Any cracks and leakages can cause loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The current industry standards for conducting maintenance of vital SSCs can be time and cost-intensive. AI can play a greater role in the condition assessment and can be extended to recognize concrete degradation (chloride-induced damage and alkali–silica reaction) before cracks develop. This paper reviews developments in condition assessment and AI applications of structural and mechanical systems. The applicability of existing techniques to nuclear systems is somewhat limited because its response requires characterization of high and low-frequency vibration modes, whereas previous studies focus on systems where a single vibration mode can define the degraded state. Data assimilation and storage is another challenging aspect of autonomous control. Advances in AI and data mining world can help to address these challenges.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,,2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,"H. Sandhu, S.

In recent years however, synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SRμCT) has become a tool for extending the imaging of two-dimensional thin sections into three-dimensional imaging of tissue blocks, enabling so-called virtual histology with arbitrary clipping planes, volumetric rendering and automatic segmentation. In this study, we present a thorough characterization of human carotid plaques after endarterectomy of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), investigating several different pathologic structures using both SRμCT and histology. Phase-contrast SRμCT was performed with two different magnifications (voxel sizes 6.5 μm and 0.65 μm, respectively), and histology was performed with multiple different stainings (Alpha-actin, Glycophorin A, von Kossa, Movat, CD68). The 0.65 μm high-resolution SRμCT was performed on selected areas with plaque typical relevant morphology, identified on the 6.5 μm low-resolution SRμCT. The tomography datasets were reconstructed with additional 3D volume rendering and compared to histology. In total, nine different regions with typical pathologic structures were identified and imaged with high-resolution SRμCT. The results show many characteristics typical for advanced atherosclerotic plaques, clinically relevant, namely ruptures with thrombosis, neo-vascularization, inflammatory infiltrates in shoulder regions, lipid rich necrotic cores (LRNC), thin fibrous cap, calcifications, lumen irregularities, and changes in vessel wall structures such as the internal elastic membrane. This method’s non-destructive nature renders details of micro-structures with an excellent visual likeness to histology, with the additional strength of multiplanar and 3D visualization and the possibility of multiple re-scans.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,17,,2022,2022-04-26 00:00:00,"My Truong, T.

Visualization of such small structures in vivo with high spatial resolution is an unsolved issue. The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) in the determination of atherosclerotic plaques with calcifications by validating this technique with micro-computer tomography (micro-CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The fibrocalcific plaques were obtained from 12 different patients and initially examined with micro-CT. The images exhibited calcifications within these plaques. For imaging with SAM, approximately 5 μm thick slices were prepared. Sound speed values within calcified regions were measured to be greater than the ones in collagen-rich regions. These fibrocalcific plaques were also examined with SEM and EDS revealing collagen and calcium deposition within these samples. The consistency of the results obtained by all of the modalities involved in our study is an indication of the potential of SAM as a clinical tool for the diagnosis of vulnerable plaques.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,9,,2019,2019-01-24 00:00:00,"B.

In this regard, drones are one promising alternative to be used as delivery agents. However, security and Quality of Service (QoS) are major concerns while making use of drones for deliveries. In order to secure the drone communication system, we propose, CovaDel: a blockchain-based scheme to secure data transactions for the drone delivery use case that works in a phased manner. The proposed scheme make use of decoupled blockchain architecture to overcome the limited resources capabilities of drones to perform blockchain-based computations. Further, to ensure the QoS adherence, we also propose a QoS-aware communication approach that handles collisions and congestion on the basis of firefly algorithm’s attractiveness parameter (light intensity) received by the drones. Results obtained using a simulated environment verify the efficacy of the proposed scheme on the basis of gas consumed, transaction time, average network throughput, and delay.",Computing,journal,48433268-b689-457a-8e57-36895fd4f04e,Computing,1589 - 1613,104,,2022,2022-03-14 00:00:00,"Maninderpal Singh, G.

A human taste panel was conducted to assess the potential of infant formula milk (Aptamil® 1) to mask the taste of two model WHO priority medicines, zinc sulfate and paracetamol, manufactured as dispersible tablets. Simultaneously, the palatability of powder blends of the tablet platforms was assessed. Twenty healthy adult volunteers performed a swirl-and-spit assessment of placebos and API-containing blends in either a lactose-based or a mannitol-based dispersible tablet platform, reconstituted in 10 mL of either water or Aptamil® 1. Eighteen samples were rated for aversion using a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale, grittiness using a 5-point Likert scale, and “acceptability-as-a-medicine” evaluated as: “Would you find this sample acceptable to swallow as a medicine?” with binary answers of Yes/No. The API-containing formulations were more aversive than the placebos; the paracetamol-containing samples being more aversive than zinc sulfate samples. The platforms themselves were not aversive. Non-gritty samples had four-fold greater odds of being acceptable as a medicine. Aptamil® 1 masked the taste of zinc sulfate in the mannitol-based formulation but did not mask the taste of paracetamol in either platform, suggesting a limited taste-masking ability, which may be API and formulation dependent.",Pharmaceutics,journal,3c77be64-fcd3-444d-a98d-f563ab841a7e,Pharmaceutics,,14,,2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,"Samuel E.

In order to solve these problems, hot-melt extrusion (HME) was used to prepare azithromycin amorphous solid dispersion. Preliminary selection of a polymer for HME was conducted by calculating Hansen solubility parameter to predict the miscibility of the drug and polymer. Eudragit® RL PO was chosen as the polymer due to its combination of taste-masking effect and dissolution. Moreover, the solubility was improved with this polymer. Design of experiments (DoE) was used to optimize the formulation and process, with screw speed, extrusion temperature, and drug percentage as independent variables, and content, dissolution, and extrudates diameter as dependent variables. The optimal extrusion parameters were obtained as follows: temperature—150 °C; screw speed—75 rpm; and drug percentage—25%. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) studies of the powdered solid dispersions showed that the crystalline AZI transformed into the amorphous form. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicated that the formation of a hydrogen bond between AZI and the polymer led to the stabilization of AZI in its amorphous form. In conclusion, this work illustrated the importance of HME for the preparation of amorphous solid dispersion of AZI, which can solve the problems of bitterness and low solubility. It is also of great significance for the development of compliant pediatric AZI preparation.",Polymers,journal,4efb9ad7-9740-4922-b9c8-c29376ca2223,Polymers,,14,,2022,2022-01-26 00:00:00,"Jiale Li, Conghui Li, Hui Zhang, Xiang Gao, Ting Wang, Zengming Wang, Aiping Zheng","2155413315, 2144205696, 46702501, 2149396613, 2155392574, 1517728183, 2879031",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ceb7fb7ce156ff5e1aa2f137d4e66fc830d9672,"Chemistry, Materials Science, Medicine",2155413315,['JournalArticle'],24.0,36.0

In this study, we will create normative values for the “Taste Strips” in children. This cross-sectional study included 609 children aged 6–15 years. “Taste Strips” were used to determine sweet, sour, salty, and bitter taste scores by a non-forced procedure. The 10th percentile was used to distinguish normal taste function from a reduced sense of taste. Multivariable generalized linear models (GLM) were estimated to study the effect of age (group), sex, and 6‐n‐propylthiouracil (PROP) status on taste function. Taste function changed with age, allowing for a distinction of three age groups: (I) 6–7 years, (II) 8–9 years, and (III) 10–15 years. Normative values were created for the age groups and boys and girls separately. Additionally, GLM showed a significant effect of (1) age (group) on sweet, salty, bitter, and total taste scores; (2) sex on sweet, sour, and total taste scores; and (3) PROP status on total taste scores. This study provided normative values for the “Taste Strips” in children, highlighting age- and sex-related differences. Taste dysfunction can be harmful and impacts quality of life, a topic that became increasingly important since the COVID-19 pandemic. Although taste dysfunction is thought to be rare in childhood, the detrimental impact of such dysfunction might be large, as children’s eating habits are strongly influenced by input from the chemical senses. Measuring taste function may elucidate the relationship between taste dysfunction and disease, fostering the development of more appropriate supportive strategies. However, adequate tools are lacking for children. Normative values of the “Taste Strips” are now available for children, which bolster the clinical utility of this test.

Children are extremely sensitive to drug tastes, and their compliance is especially poor with bitter medicine. Therefore, judging whether a drug is bitter and adopting flavor correction and taste-masking strategies are key to solving the problem of drug compliance in children. Although various machine learning models for bitterness and sweetness prediction have been reported in the literature, no learning model or bitterness database for children's medication has yet been reported. In this study, we trained four different machine learning models to predict bitterness. The goal of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning model called the ""Children's Bitter Drug Prediction System'' (CBDPS) based on Tkinter, which predicts the bitterness of a medicine based on its chemical structure. Users can enter the Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) formula for a single compound or multiple compounds, and CBDPS will predict the bitterness of children's medicines made from those XGBoost-Molecular ACCess System (XgBoost-MACCS) model yielded an accuracy of 88% under cross-validation.",Chemical and pharmaceutical bulletin,journal,d963b61b-99d2-48fc-b99a-cd2e6d8e6f6f,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,,,,2021,2021-08-21 00:00:00,"Guoliang Bai, Tiantian Wu, Libo Zhao, Xiaoling Wang, Shan Li, X.

The method EVfold broke new ground using mean-field Direct Coupling Analysis (EVfold-mfDCA); the method PSICOV applied a related concept by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix. Both methods (EVfold-mfDCA and PSICOV) are publicly available, but both require too much CPU time for interactive applications. On top, EVfold-mfDCA depends on proprietary software. Here, we present FreeContact, a fast, open source implementation of EVfold-mfDCA and PSICOV. On a test set of 140 proteins, FreeContact was almost eight times faster than PSICOV without decreasing prediction performance. The EVfold-mfDCA implementation of FreeContact was over 220 times faster than PSICOV with negligible performance decrease. EVfold-mfDCA was unavailable for testing due to its dependency on proprietary software. FreeContact is implemented as the free C++ library “libfreecontact”, complete with command line tool “freecontact”, as well as Perl and Python modules. All components are available as Debian packages. FreeContact supports the BioXSD format for interoperability.

Our method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein structure and function from sequence information alone. Recently, global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature of the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires exponential time in the protein length, and efficient approximations are needed for practical applicability. Here we propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian modeling approach as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete amino-acid variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The resulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and exactly solvable. We show that the quality of inference is comparable or superior to the one achieved by mean-field approximations to inference with discrete variables, as done by direct-coupling analysis. This is true for (i) the prediction of residue-residue contacts in proteins, and (ii) the identification of protein-protein interaction partner in bacterial signal transduction.

Accumulating evidence shows that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play a key role in the immune responses to sepsis. Nevertheless, the effects of HLA genes in sepsis have still not been comprehensively understood. Methods: A systematical search was performed in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases from inception to 10 September 2021. Random forest (RF) and modified Lasso penalized regression were conducted to identify hub genes in multi-transcriptome data, thus we constructed a prediction model, namely the HLA classifier. ArrayExpress databases, as external validation, were utilized to evaluate its diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive performance. Immune cell infiltration score was calculated via CIBERSORTx tools and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and ssGSEA were conducted to determine the pathways that are significantly enriched in different subgroups. Next, we systematically correlated the HLA classifier with immunological characteristics from multiple perspectives, such as immune-related cell infiltration, pivotal molecular pathways, and cytokine expression. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate the expression level of HLA genes in clinical samples. Results: A total of nine datasets comprising 1,251 patients were included. Based on RF and modified Lasso penalized regression in multi-transcriptome datasets, five HLA genes (B2M, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2) were identified as hub genes, which were used to construct an HLA classifier. In the discovery cohort, the HLA classifier exhibited superior diagnostic value (AUC = 0.997) and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.716) than clinical characteristics or endotypes. Encouragingly, similar results were observed in the ArrayExpress databases. In the E-MTAB-7581 dataset, the use of hydrocortisone in the HLA high-risk subgroup (OR: 2.84, 95% CI 1.07–7.57, p = 0.037) was associated with increased risk of mortality, but not in the HLA low-risk subgroup. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis by CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA revealed that B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and infiltrating lymphocytes (ILs) were significantly richer in HLA low-risk phenotypes, while Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were more abundant in HLA high-risk phenotypes. The HLA classifier was significantly negatively correlated with B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and ILs, yet was significantly positively correlated with Tregs and MDSCs. Subsequently, molecular pathways analysis uncovered that cytokine-cytokine receptor (CCR) interaction, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and antigen-presenting cell (APC) co-stimulation were significantly enriched in HLA low-risk endotypes, which was significantly negatively correlated with the HLA classifier in multi-transcriptome data. Finally, the expression levels of several cytokines (IL-10, IFNG, TNF) were significantly different between the HLA subgroups, and the ratio of IL-10/TNF was significantly positively correlated with HLA score in multi-transcriptome data. Results of qRT-PCR validated the higher expression level of B2M as well as lower expression level of HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2 in sepsis samples compared to control sample. Conclusion: Based on five HLA genes, a diagnostic and prognostic model, namely the HLA classifier, was established, which is closely correlated with responses to hydrocortisone and immunosuppression status and might facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",Frontiers in Physiology,journal,e28a224b-8ddb-49a6-82d2-17f23c68b30c,Frontiers in Physiology,,13,,2022,2022-05-24 00:00:00,"Zhen Chen, R.

Coagulation is a key component of innate immunity since it prevents bacterial dissemination and can provoke inflammation. The term immunothrombosis describes the process by which the innate immune response drives aberrant coagulation, which can result in a lethal condition termed disseminated intravascular coagulation, often seen in sepsis. In this review, we describe the recently uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying inflammasome‐ and STING‐driven immunothrombosis induced by bacterial and viral infections, culminating in tissue factor (TF) activation and release. Current anticoagulant therapeutics, while effective, are associated with a life‐threatening bleeding risk, requiring the urgent development of new treatments. Targeting immunothrombosis may provide a safer option. Thus, we highlight preclinical tools which target TF and/or block canonical (NLRP3) or noncanonical (caspase‐11) inflammasome activation as well as STING‐driven TF release and discuss clinically approved drugs which block key immunothrombotic processes and, therefore, may be redeployed as safer anticoagulants.",European Journal of Immunology,journal,4bd4c659-7597-4156-bae1-ab3e8fba3fe5,European Journal of Immunology,1024 - 1034,52,,2022,2022-05-15 00:00:00,"Tristram A.

Biomarkers offer utility for diagnosis, prognosis, early disease recognition, risk stratification, appropriate treatment (theranostics), and trial enrichment for patients with sepsis or suspected sepsis. In this narrative review, we aim to answer the question, ""Do biomarkers in patients with sepsis or septic shock predict mortality, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or organ dysfunction?"" We also discuss the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and biomarkers associated with intestinal permeability, endothelial injury, organ dysfunction, blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, brain injury, and short and long-term mortality. For sepsis, a range of biomarkers is identified, including fluid phase pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), complement system, cytokines, chemokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, cell membrane receptors, cell proteins, metabolites, and soluble receptors. We also provide an overview of immune response biomarkers that can help identify or differentiate between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, septic shock, and sepsis-associated encephalopathy.

The Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies that had been published in English and focused on children and young people between 0 and 24 years of age. This identified 21 studies from 11 countries, covering more than 96,000 subjects from 3 to 24 years of age. Pre-pandemic and pandemic data were compared. Most studies reported longitudinal deterioration in the mental health of adolescents and young people, with increased depression, anxiety and psychological distress after the pandemic started. Other findings included deteriorated negative affect, mental well-being and increased loneliness. Comparing data for pandemic and pre-pandemic periods showed that the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the mental health of children and young people.

This study assessed mental health in high school students 1.5 years after the pandemic began in Austria. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from September to November 2021. Well-being (WHO-5), depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep quality were assessed. A total of 1505 adolescents participated (78% girls). The cut-offs for clinically relevant symptoms were exceeded by 62% girls and 38.1% boys for depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 11), 49% girls and 29% boys for anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 11) and 28% girls and 17% boys for insomnia (ISI score ≥ 15). The prevalence of suicidal ideation (item 9 of the PHQ-9) within the last 2 weeks was 47% in girls and 32% in boys. These data collected in autumn 2021 (the start of the second semester of reopened schools; t2) were compared to data collected in February 2021 (one semester after remote schooling; t1). A matched pairs analysis according to age, gender, region, school type and migration background resulted in a total sample size of N  = 2514 adolescents. Results showed small deteriorations in mental health (i.e., well-being, depression, insomnia, suicidal ideation) in girls at t2 compared to t1, and an increase in suicidal thoughts in boys (all p -values < 0.05).

The Relationship Between Conspiracy Thinking and the Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Adult Poles,"The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic, tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms among the surveyed Poles. The study was conducted via the Internet in a group of 700 people aged 24.8 ± 6.3 years (mean ± SD). 585 females and 110 males were involved. Scales such as Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the original questionnaire COVID-19 Conspiratorial Beliefs Scale (COVID-19 CBS) designed to measure the tendency to believe in false information about COVID-19 pandemic were used. A positive correlation was observed between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 CBS) and the tendency to believe in general conspiracy theories (GCBS) (r = 0.768; p < 0.001). Moreover, both COVID-19 CBS and GCBS positively correlated with the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study group. For COVID-19 CBS, the correlation coefficients were 0.087 (p < 0.021) and.108 (p < 0.004) for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, while for GCBS the coefficients were 0.132 (p < 0.001) and 0.147 (p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the increased tendency to believe in false beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in the severity of anxiety (b = 0.04; p = 0.021) and depression (b = 0.06; p < 0.001) symptoms. It can be hypothesized that the tendency to believe in false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is positively associated with the tendency to general belief in conspiracy theories.

01bf75c26b238aea72231f9224f6dbff450c0e7e,10.1613/jair.816,An Analysis of Reduced Error Pruning,"Top-down induction of decision trees has been observed to suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase. In particular, it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows linearly with the sample size, even though the accuracy of the tree does not improve. Reduced Error Pruning is an algorithm that has been used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems of decision tree learning. 
 
In this paper we present analyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three different settings. First we study the basic algorithmic properties of the method, properties that hold independent of the input decision tree and pruning examples. Then we examine a situation that intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be replaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute values of the pruning examples are independent of each other. This analysis is conducted under two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis we assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This assumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do not receive any pruning examples. 
 
This paper clarifies the different variants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its algorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis.",Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,journal,aef12dca-60a0-4ca3-819b-cad26d309d4e,J.

The traditional approach of leveraging physical measurements for detecting cyber-induced physical contingencies is insufficient to reflect the accurate cyber-physical states. Moreover, deploying conventional rule-based and anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for cyberattack detection results in higher false positives. Hence, independent usage of detection tools of cyberattacks in cyber and physical sides has a limited capability. In this work, a mechanism to fuse real-time data from cyber and physical domains, to improve situational awareness of the whole system is developed. It is demonstrated how improved situational awareness can help reduce false positives in intrusion detection. This cyber and physical data fusion results in cyber-physical state space explosion which is addressed using different feature transformation and selection techniques. Our fusion engine is further integrated into a cyber-physical power system testbed as an application that collects cyber and power system telemetry from multiple sensors emulating real-world data sources found in a utility. These are synthesized into features for algorithms to detect cyber intrusions. Results are presented using the proposed data fusion application to infer False Data and Command Injection (FDI and FCI)-based Man-in-The-Middle attacks. Post collection, the data fusion application uses time-synchronized merge and extracts features. This is followed by pre-processing such as imputation, categorical encoding, and feature reduction, before training supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning models to evaluate the performance of the intrusion detection system. A major finding is the improvement of detection accuracy by fusion of features from cyber, security, and physical domains. Additionally, it is observed that the semi-supervised co-training technique performs at par with supervised learning methods with the proposed feature vector. The approach and toolset, as well as the dataset that is generated can be utilized to prevent threats such as false data or command injection attacks from being carried out by identifying cyber intrusions accurately.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,119118-119138,9,,2021,2021-01-18 00:00:00,"Abhijeet Sahu, Zeyu Mao, Patrick Wlazlo, Hao Huang, K.

Machine learning (ML) is a computational method particularly suited to the establishment of predictive models of drug response based on genomic profiles of targeted cells. We report here on the application of our previously established open-source support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm to predict the responses of 175 individual cancer patients to a variety of standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs from the gene-expression profiles (RNA-seq or microarray) of individual patient tumors.

The major challenge to analyze gene expression data, with a large number of genes and small samples, is to extract disease-related information from a massive amount of redundant data and noise. Gene selection, eliminating redundant and irrelevant genes, has been a key step to address this problem. The modified method was tested on four benchmark datasets with either two-class phenotypes or multiclass phenotypes, outperforming previous methods, with relatively higher accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate and reduced runtime. This paper proposes an effective feature selection method, combining double RBF-kernels with weighted analysis, to extract feature genes from gene expression data, by exploring its nonlinear mapping ability.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,,19,,2018,2018-10-29 00:00:00,"Shenghui Liu, Chunrui Xu, Yusen Zhang, Jiaguo Liu, Bin Yu, Xiaoping Liu, M.

Contrary to what might be expected, the models derived from the CheqSol experimental data are not more accurate than those derived from the ""noisy"" literature data. The results suggest that, at the present time, it is the deficiency of QSPR methods (algorithms and/or descriptor sets), and not, as is commonly quoted, the uncertainty in the experimental measurements, which is the limiting factor in accurately predicting aqueous solubility for pharmaceutical molecules.",Molecular Pharmaceutics,journal,bfba025f-b9ce-44b1-a200-eec39dd09964,Molecular pharmaceutics,"

We make predictions of solution free energy using physics-based theory alone and using machine learning/quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) models. We also develop machine learning models where the theoretical energies and cheminformatics descriptors are used as combined input. These models are used to predict solvation free energy. While direct theoretical calculation does not give accurate results in this approach, machine learning is able to give predictions with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼1.1 log S units in a 10-fold cross-validation for our Drug-Like-Solubility-100 (DLS-100) dataset of 100 druglike molecules. We find that a model built using energy terms from our theoretical methodology as descriptors is marginally less predictive than one built on Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) descriptors. Combining both sets of descriptors allows a further but very modest improvement in the predictions. However, in some cases, this is a statistically significant enhancement. These results suggest that there is little complementarity between the chemical information provided by these two sets of descriptors, despite their different sources and methods of calculation.

However, these current datasets miss important derived descriptors such as ECG features that have been devised in the past hundred years and still form the basis of most automatic ECG analysis algorithms and are critical for cardiologists’ decision processes. ECG features are available from sophisticated commercial software but are not accessible to the general public. To alleviate this issue, we add ECG features from two leading commercial algorithms and an open-source implementation supplemented by a set of automatic diagnostic statements from a commercial ECG analysis software in preprocessed format. This allows the comparison of ML models trained on clinically versus automatically generated label sets. We provide an extensive technical validation of features and diagnostic statements for ML applications.

It is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, stroke, and premature death. Clinical diagnostic criteria comprise an increased P wave duration and biphasic P waves in lead II, III and aVF due to retrograde activation of the left atrium. Machine learning algorithms could improve the diagnosis but require a large-scale, well-controlled and balanced dataset. In silico electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, optimally obtained from a statistical shape model to cover anatomical variability, carry the potential to produce an extensive database meeting the requirements for successful machine learning application. We generated the first in silico dataset including interatrial conduction block of 9,800 simulated ECG signals based on a bi-atrial statistical shape model. Automated feature analysis was performed to evaluate P wave morphology, duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1. Increased P wave duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1 were found for models with interatrial conduction block compared to healthy models. A wide variability of P wave morphology was detected for models with interatrial conduction block. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results suggest that a biphasic P wave morphology seems to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of interatrial conduction block.

However, the process of building personalized computational models can be challenging and requires a high level of human interaction. A pipeline to standardize the generation of a patient's atrial digital twin from clinical data is therefore desirable. We propose a patient-specific Augmented Atria generation pipeline (AugmentA) as a highly automated framework which, starting from clinical geometrical data, provides ready-to-use atrial personalized computational models. AugmentA consists firstly of a pre-processing step applied to the input geometry. Secondly, the atrial orifices are identified and labelled using only one reference point per atrium. If the user chooses to fit a statistical shape model (SSM) to the input geometry, it is first rigidly aligned with the given mean shape before a non-rigid fitting procedure is applied. AugmentA automatically generates the fiber orientation and finds local conduction velocities by minimizing the error between the simulated and clinical local activation time (LAT) map. The pipeline was tested on a cohort of 29 patients on both segmented magnetic resonance images (MRI) and electroanatomical maps of the left atrium. Moreover, the pipeline was applied to a bi-atrial volumetric mesh derived from MRI. The pipeline robustly integrated fiber orientation and anatomical region annotations in 38.4+-5.7 s. The error between in-silico and clinical LAT maps was on average 12.7 ms. In conclusion, AugmentA offers an automated and comprehensive pipeline delivering atrial digital twins from clinical data in procedural time.",medRxiv,journal,d5e5b5e7-54b1-4f53-82fc-4853f3e71c58,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society,"

Intra-cardiac electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation are often performed without detailed prior knowledge of the mechanism perpetuating AFlut, likely prolonging the procedure time of these invasive interventions. We sought to discriminate the AFlut location [cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent (CTI), peri-mitral, and other left atrium (LA) AFlut classes] with a machine learning-based algorithm using only the non-invasive signals from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Methods and results Hybrid 12-lead ECG dataset of 1769 signals was used (1424 in silico ECGs, and 345 clinical ECGs from 115 patients—three different ECG segments over time were extracted from each patient corresponding to single AFlut cycles). Seventy-seven features were extracted. A decision tree classifier with a hold-out classification approach was trained, validated, and tested on the dataset randomly split after selecting the most informative features. The clinical test set comprised 38 patients (114 clinical ECGs). The classifier yielded 76.3% accuracy on the clinical test set with a sensitivity of 89.7%, 75.0%, and 64.1% and a positive predictive value of 71.4%, 75.0%, and 86.2% for CTI, peri-mitral, and other LA class, respectively. Considering majority vote of the three segments taken from each patient, the CTI class was correctly classified at 92%.

Although a 3D patient-specific model (PSM) can be obtained from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the fiber orientation of cardiac muscle, which significantly affects the electrophysiological and mechanical characteristics of the heart, can hardly be obtained in vivo. Several approaches have been suggested to solve this problem. However, most of them require a considerable amount of human interaction, which is both time-consuming and a potential source of error. In this work, a highly automated pipeline based on a Laplace- Dirichlet-rule-based method (LDRBM) for annotating fibers and anatomical regions in both atria is introduced. The calculated fiber arrangement was regionally compared with anatomical observations from literature and faithfully reproduced clinical and experimental data.",Current Directions in Biomedical Engineering,journal,0c1d66cd-6730-4184-b27c-59fdd4dd9ef7,Current Directions in Biomedical Engineering,136 - 139,7,,2021,2021-10-01 00:00:00,"Tianbao Zheng, L.

Building CDTs of cardiac EP relies on the ability of models to replicate the ventricular activation sequence under a broad range of conditions. Of pivotal importance is the His–Purkinje system (HPS) within the ventricles. Workflows for the generation and incorporation of HPS models are needed for use in cardiac digital twinning pipelines that aim to minimize the misfit between model predictions and clinical data such as the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG). We thus develop an automated two stage approach for HPS personalization. A fascicular-based model is first introduced that modulates the endocardial Purkinje network. Only emergent features of sites of earliest activation within the ventricular myocardium and a fast-conducting sub-endocardial layer are accounted for. It is then replaced by a topologically realistic Purkinje-based representation of the HPS. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated. Equivalence between both HPS model representations is investigated by comparing activation patterns and 12 lead ECGs under both sinus rhythm and right-ventricular apical pacing. Predominant ECG morphology is preserved by both HPS models under sinus conditions, but elucidates differences during pacing.",Annals of Biomedical Engineering,journal,ea9d4180-f603-445c-b59a-5aaada9d4d83,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,3143 - 3153,49,,2021,2021-08-24 00:00:00,"K.

Previous work (the “DeepTop” tagger of Kasieczka et al) has shown that a CNN-based top tagger can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art conventional top taggers based on high-level inputs. Here, we introduce a number of improvements to the DeepTop tagger, including architecture, training, image preprocessing, sample size and color pixels. Our final CNN top tagger outperforms BDTs based on high-level inputs by a factor of ∼ 2-3 or more in background rejection, over a wide range of tagging efficiencies and fiducial jet selections. As reference points, we achieve a QCD background rejection factor of 500 (60) at 50% top tagging efficiency for fully-merged (non-merged) top jets with pT in the 800-900 GeV (350-450 GeV) range.

However, its relation with other CV risk evaluation tools in T1D has not been elucidated yet. This study aimed to evaluate arterial stiffness in T1D patients free from known CVD, and compare it to other CV risk evaluation tools used in T1D. Methods Cross-sectional study in adults with a T1D duration of at least 10 years and without established CVD. Patients were categorized in CVD risk groups based on 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines , and the STENO T1D risk engine was used to estimate 10-year risk for CV events. Arterial stiffness was evaluated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score was assessed and carotid ultrasound was performed. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and central hemodynamic parameters were evaluated. Data on renal function and diabetic kidney disease was retrieved. Results 54 patients (age: 46 ± 9.5 years; T1D duration: 27 ± 8.8 years) were included. One-fourth of patients showed prematurely increased aortic stiffness based on cf-PWV (24%). Cf-PWV was significantly associated with CAC score, carotid intima-media thickness, central hemodynamic parameters and diabetic kidney disease. Based on STENO, 20 patients (37%) were at low, 20 patients (37%) at moderate, and 14 patients (26%) at high 10-year risk for CV event. Cf-PWV was strongly associated with the STENO score (r s  = + 0.81; R 2  = 0.566, p < 0.001), increasing with each higher STENO group (p < 0.01). However, cf-PWV was not significantly different between the two CV risk groups (high versus very high) based on ESC criteria, and ESC criteria compared to STENO classified 10 patients more as having > 10% 10-year risk for CV events (n = 44/54; 81.5% versus n = 34/54; 63%). Conclusions This study demonstrated that a substantial proportion of long-standing T1D patients free from known CVD show premature arterial stiffening. Cf-PWV strongly associates with the STENO risk score for future CV events and with cardiovascular imaging and function outcomes, thereby illustrating the clinical importance of arterial stiffness. The data, however, also show considerable heterogeneity in CV risk and differences in risk categorisation between the STENO tool and ESC criteria.There is a need for refinement of CV risk classification in T1D, and future studies should investigate if evaluation of arterial stiffness should be implemented in T1D clinical practice and which patients benefit the most from its assessment.",Cardiovascular Diabetology,journal,e370d142-085d-49ec-8cac-604c340365b8,Cardiovascular Diabetology,,21,,2022,2022-06-09 00:00:00,"S.

Methods We retrospectively collected electronic medical records of enrolled patients from the data warehouse of China Medical University Hospital, a tertiary medical center in central Taiwan, from January 2012 to November 2018. We included patients who underwent a documented carotid ultrasound within 30 days of experiencing an acute first stroke during the study period. We classified these participants into two groups: those with non-recurrent stroke (those who has not been diagnosed with acute stroke again during the study period) and those with recurrent stoke (those who has been diagnosed with acute stroke during the study period). A total of 1,235 carotid sonographic parameters were analyzed. Data on the patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities were also collected. Python 3.7 was used as the programming language, and the scikit-learn toolkit was used to complete the derivation and verification of the machine learning methods. Results In total, 2,411 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 1,896 and 515 had non-recurrent and recurrent stroke, respectively. After extraction, 43 features of carotid sonography (36 carotid sonographic parameters and seven transcranial color Doppler sonographic parameter) were analyzed. For predicting recurrent stroke, CatBoost achieved the highest area under the curve (0.844, CIs 95% 0.824–0.868), followed by the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (0.832, CIs 95% 0.813–0.851), random forest (0.819, CIs 95% 0.802–0.846), support-vector machine (0.759, CIs 95% 0.739–0.781), logistic regression (0.781, CIs 95% 0.764–0.800), and decision tree (0.735, CIs 95% 0.717–0.755) models. Conclusion When using the CatBoost model, the top three features for predicting recurrent stroke were determined to be the use of anticoagulation medications, the use of NSAID medications, and the resistive index of the left subclavian artery. The CatBoost model demonstrated efficiency and achieved optimal performance in the predictive classification of non-recurrent and recurrent stroke.",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,journal,3bc0e661-dc2a-454a-9ff5-6515430ce9ff,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,,9,,2022,2022-01-28 00:00:00,"Shih-Yi Lin, Kin-Man Law, Y.

Methods: The cardiometabolic risk profile was defined based on the Adult Treatment Panel III panel. Carotid intimal media thickness (cIMT) and arterial stiffness were assessed using high-resolution ultrasonography. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to estimate the association between FM and cardiometabolic risk factors. We used a general linear regression to compare the cIMT and carotid beta-index between the participants with and without FM. Pearson’s coefficient was calculated to evaluate the potential correlation between cardiometabolic risk profiles, cIMT, and arterial stiffening in FM. Results: FM participants showed a higher risk of central obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49, 6.91), high triglyceride (OR = 4.73, 95% CI 2.29, 9.79), and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (OR = 4.27, 95% CI 2.07, 8.81) compared to the control group. The FM group exhibited higher beta-index values than the control group (p = 0.003). Although IFG and triglyceride glucose index showed a tendency to correlate with the beta-index, statistical significance was not observed. Conclusions: FM was associated with an increased risk of central obesity, high triglyceride levels, and IFG. Furthermore, advanced arterial stiffness of the carotid artery was observed in FM, which might be correlated with insulin resistance.",Biomedicines,journal,abc0c598-b988-4841-a8c5-65bfa6f3df77,Biomedicines,,9,,2021,2021-11-28 00:00:00,"Yunkyung Kim, Geun-Tae Kim, Jihun Kang","123633623, 5500247, 147091329",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfc5dc6c78ce1461a335cd2e669243470b42d606,Medicine,123633623,['JournalArticle'],8.0,46.0

The incidence of cardiovascular events remains high in diabetics. However, a clinical prediction model for elevated arterial stiffness using machine learning to identify subjects consequently at higher risk remains to be developed. Methods Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination were used for feature selection. Four machine learning algorithms were used to construct a prediction model, and their performance was compared based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric in a discovery dataset (n = 760). The model with the best performance was selected and validated in an independent dataset (n = 912) from the Dryad Digital Repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m484p). To apply our model to clinical practice, we built a free and user-friendly web online tool. Results The predictive model includes the predictors: age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index. In the discovery cohort, the gradient boosting-based model outperformed other methods in the elevated arterial stiffness prediction. In the validation cohort, the gradient boosting model showed a good discrimination capacity. A cutoff value of 0.46 for the elevated arterial stiffness risk score in the gradient boosting model resulted in a good specificity (0.813 in the discovery data and 0.761 in the validation data) and sensitivity (0.875 and 0.738, respectively) trade-off points.

We wished to validate this effect and explore potential mechanisms of action. Methods In a multicentre inception cohort of eRA patients (n=191), we examined the whole blood IGS (MxA, IFI44L, OAS1, IFI6, ISG15) with reference to circulating IFN proteins, clinical outcomes and epigenetic influences on circulating CD19+ B and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Results We reproduced our previous findings demonstrating a raised baseline IGS. We additionally showed, for the first time, that the IGS in eRA reflects circulating IFN-α protein. Paired longitudinal analysis demonstrated a significant reduction between baseline and 6-month IGS and IFN-α levels (p<0.0001 for both). Despite this fall, a raised baseline IGS predicted worse 6-month clinical outcomes such as increased disease activity score (DAS-28, p=0.025) and lower likelihood of a good EULAR clinical response (p=0.034), which was independent of other conventional predictors of disease activity and clinical response. Molecular analysis of CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells demonstrated differentially methylated CPG sites and dysregulated expression of disease relevant genes, including PARP9, STAT1, and EPSTI1, associated with baseline IGS/IFNα levels. Differentially methylated CPG sites implicated altered transcription factor binding in B cells (GATA3, ETSI, NFATC2, EZH2) and T cells (p300, HIF1α). Conclusions Our data suggest that, in eRA, IFN-α can cause a sustained, epigenetically mediated, pathogenic increase in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and that the IGS is, therefore, a robust prognostic biomarker. Its persistent harmful effects provide a rationale for the initial therapeutic targeting of IFN-α in selected patients with eRA.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,journal,2457f111-719e-405a-8b99-3e2ad59ad1e3,Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,1214 - 1223,81,,2022,2022-06-09 00:00:00,"Faye A H Cooles, J.

Approximately 40% of patients do not respond to individual biologic therapies and 5–20% are refractory to all. In a biopsy-based, precision-medicine, randomized clinical trial in RA (R4RA; n = 164), patients with low/absent synovial B cell molecular signature had a lower response to rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) compared with that to tocilizumab (anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody) although the exact mechanisms of response/nonresponse remain to be established. Here, in-depth histological/molecular analyses of R4RA synovial biopsies identify humoral immune response gene signatures associated with response to rituximab and tocilizumab, and a stromal/fibroblast signature in patients refractory to all medications. Post-treatment changes in synovial gene expression and cell infiltration highlighted divergent effects of rituximab and tocilizumab relating to differing response/nonresponse mechanisms. Using ten-by-tenfold nested cross-validation, we developed machine learning algorithms predictive of response to rituximab (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74), tocilizumab (AUC = 0.68) and, notably, multidrug resistance (AUC = 0.69). This study supports the notion that disease endotypes, driven by diverse molecular pathology pathways in the diseased tissue, determine diverse clinical and treatment–response phenotypes. It also highlights the importance of integration of molecular pathology signatures into clinical algorithms to optimize the future use of existing medications and inform the development of new drugs for refractory patients. Biomarker analysis of the phase 4 R4RA trial identifies pretreatment synovial biopsy features selectively associated with response to rituximab or tocilizumab, and leads to the development of models that might predict treatment benefit in patients with rheumatoid arthritis",Nature Network Boston,journal,9e995b6d-f30b-4ab4-a13b-3dc2cc992f47,Nature Medicine,1256 - 1268,28,,2022,2022-05-19 00:00:00,"F.

Monocytes (MOs) and macrophages, largely associated with arthritis, are contributors and sensors of inflammation through epigenetic modifications. In this study, we investigated associations between clinical features and DNA methylation in blood and synovial fluid (SF) MOs in a prospective cohort of patients with early inflammatory arthritis. DNA methylation profiles of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) blood MOs exhibited marked alterations in comparison with those from healthy donors. We identified additional differences both in blood and SF MOs after comparing patients with UA grouped by their future outcomes, i.e., good versus poor. Patient profiles in subsequent visits revealed a reversion toward a healthy level in both groups, those requiring disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and those who remitted spontaneously. Changes in disease activity between visits also affected DNA methylation, which was partially concomitant in the SF of UA and in blood MOs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Epigenetic similarities between arthritis types allow a common prediction of disease activity. Our results constitute a resource of DNA methylation–based biomarkers of poor prognosis, disease activity, and treatment efficacy for the personalized clinical management of early inflammatory arthritis.",JCI Insight,journal,e6c392b4-b4fc-409c-8ff2-c490c0407611,JCI Insight,,7,,2022,2022-03-24 00:00:00,"C. de la Calle-Fabregat, J.

This potential is encapsulated by the concept of a quantum advantage, which is contingent on a reduction in the consumption of a computational resource, such as time, space or data. Here, we distill the concept of a quantum advantage into a simple framework to aid researchers in biology and medicine pursuing the development of quantum applications. We then apply this framework to a wide variety of computational problems relevant to these domains in an effort to (i) assess the potential of practical advantages in specific application areas and (ii) identify gaps that may be addressed with novel quantum approaches. In doing so, we provide an extensive survey of the intersection of biology and medicine with the current landscape of quantum algorithms and their potential advantages. While we endeavour to identify specific computational problems that may admit practical advantages throughout this work, the rapid pace of change in the fields of quantum computing, classical algorithms and biological research implies that this intersection will remain highly dynamic for the foreseeable future.",Journal of the Royal Society Interface,journal,f6537e0e-c3a9-4de5-bd36-19eda0434065,Journal of the Royal Society Interface,,19,,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,"Benjamin A.

However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits. Expectations for quantum machine learning are high, but there is currently a lack of rigorous results on which scenarios would actually exhibit a quantum advantage. Here, the authors show how to tell, for a given dataset, whether a quantum model would give any prediction advantage over a classical one.",Nature Communications,journal,43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,12,,2020,2020-11-03 00:00:00,"Hsin-Yuan Huang, M.

In this paper, we propose an MCTS-T algorithm for generating adversarial examples of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The MCTS algorithm enables the generation model to provide a reward value that reflects the probability of generative examples bypassing the detector. To guarantee the antagonism and feasibility of the generative adversarial examples, the bypassing rules are restricted. The experimental results indicate that the missed detection rate of adversarial examples is significantly improved after the MCTS-T generation algorithm. Additionally, we construct a generative adversarial network (GAN) to optimize the detector and improve the detection rate when dealing with adversarial examples. After several epochs of adversarial training, the accuracy of detecting adversarial examples is significantly improved.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,10989-10996,8,,2020,2020-01-09 00:00:00,"Xueqin Zhang, Yue Zhou, Songwen Pei, J.

Based on the unsupervised learning models autoencoder (AE) and the generative adversarial networks (GAN) model during deep learning, the study aim is to solve the imbalance of data and intrusion detection of high performance. The AE-CGAN (autoencoder-conditional GAN) model is proposed to improve the performance of intrusion detection. This model oversamples rare classes based on the GAN model in order to solve the performance degradation caused by data imbalance after processing the characteristics of the data to a lower level using the autoencoder model. To measure the performance of the AE-CGAN model, data is classified using random forest (RF), a typical machine learning classification algorithm. In this experiment, we used the canadian institute for cybersecurity intrusion detection system (CICIDS)2017 dataset, the latest public dataset of network intrusion detection system (NIDS), and compared the three models to confirm efficacy of the proposed model. We compared the performance of three types of models. These included single-RF, a classification model using only a classification algorithm, AE-RF which is processed by classifying data features, and the AE-CGAN model which is classified after solving the data feature processing and data imbalance. Experimental results showed that the performance of the AE-CGAN model proposed in this paper was the highest. In particular, when the data were unbalanced, the performances of recall and F1 score, which are more accurate performance indicators, were 93.29% and 95.38%, respectively. The AE-CGAN model showed much better performance.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2019,2019-10-10 00:00:00,"Joohwa Lee, Kee-Hyun Park","2108413988, 50788962",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/875634a8eed00a679ee2db9dd6475e19912b124b,"Computer Science, Engineering",2108413988,,46.0,30.0

The rate of attacks against networked systems has increased dramatically, and the tactics used by the attackers are continuing to evolve. Intrusion detection is one of the solutions against these attacks. A common and effective approach for designing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is Machine Learning. The performance of an IDS is significantly improved when the features are more discriminative and representative. This study uses two feature dimensionality reduction approaches: (i) Auto-Encoder (AE): an instance of deep learning, for dimensionality reduction, and (ii) Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting low-dimensional features from both techniques are then used to build various classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Network, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for designing an IDS. The experimental findings with low-dimensional features in binary and multi-class classification show better performance in terms of Detection Rate (DR), F-Measure, False Alarm Rate (FAR), and Accuracy. This research effort is able to reduce the CICIDS2017 dataset’s feature dimensions from 81 to 10, while maintaining a high accuracy of 99.6% in multi-class and binary classification. Furthermore, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Class Combined performance metric C o m b i n e d M c with respect to class distribution to compare various multi-class and binary classification systems through incorporating FAR, DR, Accuracy, and class distribution parameters. In addition, we developed a uniform distribution based balancing approach to handle the imbalanced distribution of the minority class instances in the CICIDS2017 network intrusion dataset.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2019,2019-03-14 00:00:00,"Razan Abdulhammed, Hassan Musafer, Ali Alessa, M.

Optimizing the standard digital back propagation (DBP) as a deep neural network (DNN) with interleaving linear and nonlinear operations for fiber nonlinearity compensation was shown to improve transmission performance in idealized simulation environments. Here, we extend such concepts to practical single-channel and polarization division multiplexed wavelength division multiplexed experiments. We show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art DSP algorithms and additionally, the optimized DNN-based DBP parameters exhibit a mathematical structure which guides us to further analyze the noise statistics of fiber nonlinearity compensation. This machine learning-inspired analysis reveals that ASE noise and incomplete CD compensation of the Kerr nonlinear term produce extra distortions that accumulates along the DBP stages. Therefore, the best DSP should balance between suppressing these distortions and inverting the fiber propagation effects, and such trade-off shifts across different DBP stages in a quantifiable manner. Instead of the common ‘black-box’ approach to intractable problems, our work shows how machine learning can be a complementary tool to human analytical thinking and help advance theoretical understandings in disciplines such as optics. Nonlinear effects provide inherent limitations in fiber optical communications. Here, the authors experimentally demonstrate improved digital back propagation with machine learning and use the results to reveal insights in the optimization of digital signal processing.",Nature Communications,journal,43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,11,,2020,2020-07-23 00:00:00,"Qirui Fan, Gai Zhou, T.

The goal of this research work is to develop a system that can effectively detect fall/collapse and classify other discrete daily living activities such as sitting, standing, walking, drinking, and bending. For this paper, a publicly accessible dataset is employed, which is captured at various geographical locations using a 5.8 GHz Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) RADAR. A total of ninety-nine participants, including young and elderly individuals, took part in the experimental campaign. During data acquisition, each aforementioned activity was recorded for 5–10 s. Through the obtained data, we generated the micro-doppler signatures using short-time Fourier transform by exploiting MATLAB tools. Subsequently, the micro-doppler signatures are validated, trained, and tested using a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm called Residual Neural Network or ResNet. The ResNet classifier is developed in Python, which is utilised to classify six distinct human activities in this study. Furthermore, the metrics used to analyse the trained model’s performance are precision, recall, F1-score, classification accuracy, and confusion matrix. To test the resilience of the proposed method, two separate experiments are carried out. The trained ResNet models are put to the test by subject-independent scenarios and unseen data of the above-mentioned human activities at diverse geographical spaces. The experimental results showed that ResNet detected the falling and rest of the daily living human activities with decent accuracy.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2021,2021-09-12 00:00:00,"Umer Saeed, Syed Yaseen Shah, Syed Aziz Shah, Jawad Ahmad, A.

In real environments, activities and movements are performed with seamless motion, with continuous transitions between activities of different duration and a large range of dynamic motions, compared with discrete activities of fixed-time lengths which are typically analysed in the literature. This paper proposes a novel approach based on recurrent LSTM and Bi-LSTM network architectures for continuous activity monitoring and classification. This approach uses radar data in the form of a continuous temporal sequence of micro-Doppler or range-time information, differently from from other conventional approaches based on convolutional networks that interpret the radar data as images. Experimental radar data involving 15 participants and different sequences of 6 actions are used to validate the proposed approach. It is demonstrated that using the Doppler-domain data together with the Bi-LSTM network and an optimal learning rate can achieve over 90% mean accuracy, whereas range-domain data only achieved approximately 76%. The details of the network architectures, insights in their behaviour as a function of key hyper-parameters such as the learning rate, and a discussion on their performance across are provided in the paper.",IEEE Sensors Journal,journal,b210fd3d-11d7-478e-a0aa-7e3d2a4f482d,IEEE Sensors Journal,13607-13619,20,,2020,2020-11-15 00:00:00,"Aman Shrestha, Haobo Li, J.

In the same context, present study proposes an advancement in feature extraction method from the micro‐Doppler spectrogram with the application of spatial statistics for moving human subject classification which minimizes the spectrogram analysis. A novel approach of spatial feature extraction from whole image spectrogram, followed by support vector machine (SVM) classifiers algorithm for multiclass classification, has been proposed in the present study. The proposed method has been tested for prediction accuracy and validated by applying on a very close and important five distinct human activities (which usually arise at any security observation site) as reported in the available literature. The results obtained adopting the proposed approach exhibit high accuracy for multiclass classification; yielding cross‐validation accuracy of 96.7% while actual predication of testing data provides the accuracy of 93.33%.

However, searching for the stops is a tough task at the LHC. To dig the stops out of the huge LHC data, various expert-constructed kinematic variables or cutting-edge analysis techniques have been invented. In this paper, we propose to represent collision events as event graphs and use the message passing neutral network (MPNN) to analyze the events. As a proof-of-concept, we use our method in the search of the stop pair production at the LHC, and find that our MPNN can efficiently discriminate the signal and back-ground events.

The model aims to describe proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. A convolutional autoencoder learns a set of kernels that efficiently encode the behaviour of fully showered QCD collision events. The network is structured recursively so as to ensure self-similarity, and the number of trained network parameters is low. Randomness is introduced via a novel custom masking layer, which also preserves existing parton splittings by using layer-skipping connections. By applying a shower merging procedure, the network can be evaluated on unshowered events produced by a matrix element calculation. The trained network behaves as a parton shower that qualitatively reproduces jet-based observables.",Journal of High Energy Physics,journal,cb5c6d2c-8c82-406e-b42e-b691561f3e4e,Journal of High Energy Physics,,2018,,2018,2018-07-10 00:00:00,J.

We introduce a machine learning strategy for jet substructure analysis using a spectral function on the angular scale. The angular spectrum allows us to scan energy deposits over the angle between a pair of particles in a highly visual way. We set up an artificial neural network (ANN) to find out characteristic shapes of the spectra of the jets from heavy particle decays. By taking the Higgs jets and QCD jets as examples, we show that the ANN of the angular spectrum input has similar performance to existing taggers.

We show that the jet observable defined by the CNN obeys the canonical definition of infrared safety: it is unaffected by the presence of the extra gluon, as long as it is soft or collinear with one of the quarks.

Therefore, it is essential to broaden the sensitivity of the search program to include unexpected scenarios. We present a new model-agnostic anomaly detection technique that naturally benefits from modern machine learning algorithms. The only requirement on the signal for this new procedure is that it is localized in at least one known direction in phase space. Any other directions of phase space that are uncorrelated with the localized one can be used to search for unexpected features.

Traditional NIDS are incapable of detecting modern and sophisticated attacks due to the fact that they rely on pattern-matching models or simple activity analysis. Moreover, Intelligent NIDS based on Machine Learning (ML) models are still in the early stages and often exhibit low accuracy and high false positives, making them ineffective in detecting emerging cyber-attacks. On the other hand, improved detection and prediction frameworks provided by ensemble algorithms have demonstrated impressive outcomes in specific applications. In this research, we investigate the potential of ensemble models in the enhancement of NIDS functionalities in order to provide a reliable and intelligent security defense. We present a NIDS hybrid model that uses ensemble ML techniques to identify and prevent various intrusions more successfully than stand-alone approaches. A combination of several distinct machine learning methods is integrated into a hybrid framework. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is pre-processed, and its features are engineered prior to being used to train and evaluate the proposed model structure. The performance evaluation of the ensemble of various ML classifiers demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms individual model approaches.

However, the black-box nature of AI models presents a significant challenge. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand and trust the results. In order to address this, it is necessary to incorporate explainability into the detection model. There is insufficient research to provide reasons why applications are detected as malicious or explain their behavior. In this paper, we propose a method of a Vision Transformer(ViT)-based malware detection model and malicious behavior extraction using an attention map to achieve high detection accuracy and high interpretability. Malware detection uses a ViT-based model, which takes an image as input. ViT offers a significant advantage for image detection tasks by leveraging attention mechanisms, enabling robust interpretation and understanding of the intricate patterns within the images. The image is converted from an application. An attention map is generated with attention values generated during the detection process. The attention map is used to identify factors that the model deems important. Class and method names are extracted and provided based on the identified factors. The performance of the detection was validated using real-world datasets. The malware detection accuracy was 80.27%, which is a high level of accuracy compared to other models used for image-based malware detection. The interpretability was measured in the same way as the F1-score, resulting in an interpretability score of 0.70. This score is superior to existing interpretable machine learning (ML)-based methods, such as Drebin, LIME, and XMal. By analyzing malicious applications, we also confirmed that the extracted classes and methods are related to malicious behavior. With the proposed method, security experts can understand the reason behind the model’s detection and the behavior of malicious applications. Given the growing importance of explainable artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, this method is expected to make a significant contribution to this field.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2023,2023-06-05 00:00:00,"Jeonggeun Jo, Jaeik Cho, Jongsub Moon","2223031761, 2915765, 1805429",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c68ecb3e20c68135429c78eaf4a7984451e8996,Computer Science,2223031761,['JournalArticle'],13.0,21.0

However, sepsis-associated ICU-acquired infections have not been fully characterized. The study aims to assess the risk factors and develop a model that predicts the risk of ICU-acquired infections in patients with sepsis. Methods We retrieved data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors that could predict ICU-acquired infection. We also assessed its discrimination and calibration abilities and compared them with classical score systems. Results Of 16,808 included septic patients, 2,871 (17.1%) developed ICU-acquired infection. These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725–0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 95% CI, 0.734–0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models. Conclusions ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic mortality. The individualized prognostic model on the basis of the nomogram could accurately predict ICU-acquired infection and optimize management or tailored therapy.",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,journal,a19f6357-d8f7-4235-8304-c659c68ca126,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,12,,2022,2022-07-28 00:00:00,"Yajun He, Jiqian Xu, Xiaopu Shang, Xiangzhi Fang, Chenggang Gao, Deyi Sun, Lu Yao, Ting Zhou, Shangwen Pan, X.

In the present study, conventional severity classification systems were compared with artificial intelligence predictive models (Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree) in terms of the prediction of the survival rate of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit. This retrospective cohort study was performed on the data of the patients admitted to the ICU of Ghaemshahr’s Razi Teaching Care Center from March 20th, 2017, to September 22nd, 2019. The required data for calculating conventional severity classification models (SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, and APACHE IV) were collected from the patients’ medical records. Subsequently, the score of each model was calculated. Artificial intelligence predictive models (Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree) were developed in the next step. Lastly, the performance of each model in predicting the survival of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit was evaluated using the criteria of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-measure, and area under the ROC curve. Also, each model was validated externally. The R program, version 4.1, was used to create the artificial intelligence models, and SPSS Statistics Software, version 21, was utilized to perform statistical analysis. The area under the ROC curve of SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, APACHE IV, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, and CART decision tree were 76.0, 77.1, 80.3, 78.5, 84.1, and 80.0, respectively. The results showed that although the APACHE II model had better results than other conventional models in predicting the survival rate of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the other conventional models provided acceptable results too. Moreover, the findings showed that the artificial neural network model had the best performance among all the studied models, indicating the discrimination power of this model in predicting patient survival compared to the other models.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,journal,76da9cc5-c5a7-42b4-a250-3e708c5f4980,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,22,,2022,2022-06-26 00:00:00,"Farzad Mirzakhani, Farahnaz Sadoughi, Mahboobeh Hatami, Alireza Amirabadizadeh","71452593, 2122338479, 145278538, 30095707",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d517fdb8911ce89b12fda685def6408c157c67e,"Computer Science, Medicine",71452593,['JournalArticle'],13.0,45.0

We enrolled all patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.1.0) database from 2008 to 2019. Lasso regression was used for feature selection. Seven machine-learning methods were applied to develop the models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy and area under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to illustrate the effects of the features attributed to the model, and to analyze how the individual features affect the output of the model, and to visualize the Shapley value for a single individual. In total, 8,817 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation, the median age was 66.8 years (IQR, 55.9–77.1 years), and 3361 of 8817 participants (38.1%) were women. After selection, 25 of a total 57 clinical parameters collected on day 1 after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and were used for developing the machine-learning models. Among seven constructed models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.884 and an accuracy of 89.5% in the validation cohort. Feature importance analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, blood urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, urine output, and age were the top 5 features of the XGBoost model with the greatest impact. Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model visualized the individualized prediction of death. We have demonstrated the potential of machine-learning approaches for predicting outcome early in patients with sepsis.

HF mortality prediction is critical for developing individualized prevention and treatment plans. However, due to their lack of interpretability, most HF mortality prediction models have not yet reached clinical practice. Objective We aimed to develop an interpretable model to predict the mortality risk for patients with HF in intensive care units (ICUs) and used the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to explain the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model and explore prognostic factors for HF. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we achieved model development and performance comparison on the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). We extracted data during the first 24 hours of each ICU admission, and the data set was randomly divided, with 70% used for model training and 30% used for model validation. The prediction performance of the XGBoost model was compared with three other machine learning models by the area under the curve. We used the SHAP method to explain the XGBoost model. Results A total of 2798 eligible patients with HF were included in the final cohort for this study. The observed in-hospital mortality of patients with HF was 9.97%. Comparatively, the XGBoost model had the highest predictive performance among four models with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.824 (95% CI 0.7766-0.8708), whereas support vector machine had the poorest generalization ability (AUC=0.701, 95% CI 0.6433-0.7582). The decision curve showed that the net benefit of the XGBoost model surpassed those of other machine learning models at 10%~28% threshold probabilities. The SHAP method reveals the top 20 predictors of HF according to the importance ranking, and the average of the blood urea nitrogen was recognized as the most important predictor variable. Conclusions The interpretable predictive model helps physicians more accurately predict the mortality risk in ICU patients with HF, and therefore, provides better treatment plans and optimal resource allocation for their patients. In addition, the interpretable framework can increase the transparency of the model and facilitate understanding the reliability of the predictive model for the physicians.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,journal,2baad992-2268-4c38-9120-e453622f2eeb,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,24,,2022,2022-03-18 00:00:00,"Jili Li, Siru Liu, Yundi Hu, Lingfeng Zhu, Yujia Mao, Jialin Liu","2138211447, 48642149, 2112243737, 2118939543, 2176863427, 48210738",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/afe82f3559ff218cbc6c6e54a068be15ad7d03d8,"Computer Science, Medicine",2138211447,['JournalArticle'],62.0,34.0

Red cell distribution width (RDW) to platelet ratio (RPR) is a novel inflammatory index, and its prognostic effect on critically ill patients with AKI is rarely investigated. This work is aimed at investigating the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality in these patients. Methods Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. All-cause death during hospitalization was selected as the primary outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off value, and the area under the curve (AUC) was applied to compare predictive ability among different indices. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to assess the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality. Restricted cubic spline analysis for multivariate Cox model was performed to explore the shape of the relationship between RPR and mortality. Results A total of 24,166 critically ill patients with AKI were included. The relationship of RPR and in-hospital mortality was nonlinear with a trend to rise rapidly and then gradually. For mortality prediction, RPR had the optimal cut-off value of 0.093, of which the AUC was 0.791 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.773–0.810), which was higher than those of RDW, platelet, sequential organ failure assessment score, simplified acute physiology score II, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and platelet to lymphocytes ratio. After adjustments for various confounders, high RPR showed a significant association with increased mortality with hazard ratios of 1.46 (95% CI: 1.40–1.55) for categorical variable and 1.88 (95% CI: 1.80–1.97) for continuous variables in the fully adjusted model. Conclusions Elevated RPR on admission is substantially associated with high risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with AKI and thus may serve as a novel predictor of prognosis for these patients.",Disease Markers,journal,0f3e46f8-faf8-44a8-8e9c-f3f5c9b99e13,Disease Markers,,2022,,2022,2022-01-17 00:00:00,"Jiayuan Wu, Liu-qing Huang, Hairong He, Yumei Zhao, Dongdong Niu, Jun Lyu","7162508, 2027387801, 46350429, 151469497, 46390196, 80193067",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/025f783c9c95aff59a44fdb3299ba468806ab632,Medicine,7162508,['JournalArticle'],25.0,36.0

Recently, the guidelines have recommended the combined administration that using crystalloids plus albumin for septic patients, but the optimal timing for albumin combined is still unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of timing of albumin combined with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Methods We involved septic patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, and these patients were categorized into crystalloids group (crystalloids alone) and early combination group (crystalloids combined albumin at 0–24 h). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We used propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust confounding and restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was conducted to quantify the beneficial effect on survival due to the combination group. Results We categorized 6597 and 920 patients in the “crystalloids alone” and “early combination”, respectively. After PSM, compared to the crystalloids group, the combination group was associated with the increased survival among 28-day (increased survival: 3.39 days, 95% CI 2.53–4.25; P  < 0.001) after ICU admission. Patients who received albumin combination at the first 24-h was associated with prolonged LOS in ICU (10.72 days vs. 8.24 days; P  < 0.001) but lower risk of 28-day mortality (12.5% vs 16.4%, P  = 0.003) than those received crystalloids alone. Conclusion In septic patients, receiving albumin combined within the first 24-h after crystalloids administration was associated with an increment of survival in 28 days.",Annals of Intensive Care,journal,f970b1d5-df9b-4542-958b-775f51e9d3ff,Annals of Intensive Care,,11,,2021,2021-03-10 00:00:00,"Shiyu Zhou, Z.

The most common subtype (NSMP; No Specific Molecular Profile) is assigned after exclusion of the defining features of the other three molecular subtypes and includes patients with heterogeneous clinical outcomes. In this study, we employ artificial intelligence (AI)-powered histopathology image analysis to differentiate between p53abn and NSMP EC subtypes and consequently identify a sub-group of NSMP EC patients that has markedly inferior progression-free and disease-specific survival (termed ‘p53abn-like NSMP’), in a discovery cohort of 368 patients and two independent validation cohorts of 290 and 614 from other centers. Shallow whole genome sequencing reveals a higher burden of copy number abnormalities in the ‘p53abn-like NSMP’ group compared to NSMP, suggesting that this group is biologically distinct compared to other NSMP ECs. Our work demonstrates the power of AI to detect prognostically different and otherwise unrecognizable subsets of EC where conventional and standard molecular or pathologic criteria fall short, refining image-based tumor classification.

However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge—the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers—to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted κ, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840–0.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835–0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials. Through a community-driven competition, the PANDA challenge provides a curated diverse dataset and a catalog of models for prostate cancer pathology, and represents a blueprint for evaluating AI algorithms in digital pathology.",Nature Network Boston,journal,9e995b6d-f30b-4ab4-a13b-3dc2cc992f47,Nature Medicine,154 - 163,28,,2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,"W.

This approach accurately classifies cancer types and provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction. Automatically learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer types. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal aneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological subtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates.

0dd67335d80194e7ccf6c0ed275622bf60e5edce,10.3390/su14127375,Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Malicious Domains Detection Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),"With the expansion of the internet, a major threat has emerged involving the spread of malicious domains intended by attackers to perform illegal activities aiming to target governments, violating privacy of organizations, and even manipulating everyday users. Therefore, detecting these harmful domains is necessary to combat the growing network attacks. Machine Learning (ML) models have shown significant outcomes towards the detection of malicious domains. However, the “black box” nature of the complex ML models obstructs their wide-ranging acceptance in some of the fields. The emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has successfully incorporated the interpretability and explicability in the complex models. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI model has enabled the interpretability without affecting the performance of the models. This study aimed to propose an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model to detect malicious domains on a recent dataset containing 45,000 samples of malicious and non-malicious domains. In the current study, initially several interpretable ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB), and black box ensemble models, such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), AdaBoost (AB), and Cat Boost (CB) algorithms, were implemented and found that XGB outperformed the other classifiers. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI global surrogate model (Shapley additive explanations) and local surrogate LIME were used to generate the explanation of the XGB prediction. Two sets of experiments were performed; initially the model was executed using a preprocessed dataset and later with selected features using the Sequential Forward Feature selection algorithm. The results demonstrate that ML algorithms were able to distinguish benign and malicious domains with overall accuracy ranging from 0.8479 to 0.9856. The ensemble classifier XGB achieved the highest result, with an AUC and accuracy of 0.9991 and 0.9856, respectively, before the feature selection algorithm, while there was an AUC of 0.999 and accuracy of 0.9818 after the feature selection algorithm. The proposed model outperformed the benchmark study.",Sustainability,journal,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,,2022,2022-06-16 00:00:00,"Nida Aslam, Irfan Ullah Khan, Samiha Mirza, Alanoud Alowayed, Fatima M.

8bdb4900b207c7b1f5cfd5dd4752997f9765e738,10.3390/fi13120309,DNS Firewall Based on Machine Learning,"Nowadays there are many DNS firewall solutions to prevent users accessing malicious domains. These can provide real-time protection and block illegitimate communications, contributing to the cybersecurity posture of the organizations. Most of these solutions are based on known malicious domain lists that are being constantly updated. However, in this way, it is only possible to block malicious communications for known malicious domains, leaving out many others that are malicious but have not yet been updated in the blocklists. This work provides a study to implement a DNS firewall solution based on ML and so improve the detection of malicious domain requests on the fly. For this purpose, a dataset with 34 features and 90 k records was created based on real DNS logs. The data were enriched using OSINT sources. Exploratory analysis and data preparation steps were carried out, and the final dataset submitted to different Supervised ML algorithms to accurately and quickly classify if a domain request is malicious or not. The results show that the ML algorithms were able to classify the benign and malicious domains with accuracy rates between 89% and 96%, and with a classification time between 0.01 and 3.37 s. The contributions of this study are twofold. In terms of research, a dataset was made public and the methodology can be used by other researchers. In terms of solution, the work provides the baseline to implement an in band DNS firewall.",Future Internet,journal,c3e5f1c8-9ba7-47e5-acde-53063a69d483,Future Internet,309,13,,2021,2021-11-30 00:00:00,"Cláudio Marques, Silvestre Malta, J.

Currently, NMTF learns a representation of a dataset through an optimization procedure that typically uses multiplicative update rules. This procedure has had limited success, and its failure cases have not been well understood. We here perform an empirical study involving six large datasets comparing multiplicative update rules with three alternative optimization methods, including alternating least squares, projected gradients, and coordinate descent. We find that methods based on projected gradients and coordinate descent converge up to twenty-four times faster than multiplicative update rules. Furthermore, alternating least squares method can quickly train NMTF models on sparse datasets but often fails on dense datasets. Coordinate descent-based NMTF converges up to sixteen times faster compared to well-established methods.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,14,,2019,2019-06-11 00:00:00,"Andrej Čopar, B.

However, it is time-consuming and costly to determine DTIs experimentally. Over the past decade, various computational methods were proposed to predict potential DTIs with high efficiency and low costs. These methods can be roughly divided into several categories, such as molecular docking-based, pharmacophore-based, similarity-based, machine learning-based, and network-based methods. Among them, network-based methods, which do not rely on three-dimensional structures of targets and negative samples, have shown great advantages over the others. In this article, we focused on network-based methods for DTI prediction, in particular our network-based inference (NBI) methods that were derived from recommendation algorithms. We first introduced the methodologies and evaluation of network-based methods, and then the emphasis was put on their applications in a wide range of fields, including target prediction and elucidation of molecular mechanisms of therapeutic effects or safety problems. Finally, limitations and perspectives of network-based methods were discussed. In a word, network-based methods provide alternative tools for studies in drug repurposing, new drug discovery, systems pharmacology and systems toxicology.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,journal,84a6a8b4-8e85-48bd-b65e-a83d83f95908,Frontiers in Pharmacology,,9,,2018,2018-10-09 00:00:00,"Zengrui Wu, Weihua Li, Guixia Liu, Yun Tang","2299649, 39741916, 2116296369, 48066368",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ab586c427a1890932bd27fa6c89fa9875d11a05,"Computer Science, Medicine",2299649,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",151.0,126.0

Methods Eighty second- and third-year undergraduates in Lanzhou University were recruited and randomized to either three experimental groups or one control group. The subjects undertook theoretical examinations to test their basic level of knowledge after training in similarly unified knowledge courses. Each student group then participated in an eight-hour operating training session. An operation test on pig mandible was conducted, followed by a second theoretical examination. The assessment consists of three distinct parts: a subjective operating score by a clinical senior teacher, an implant accuracy analysis in cone-beam computed tomography (angular, apical, and entrance deviation), and comparison of the two theoretical examinations. Finally, students completed a questionnaire gauging their understanding of the virtual simulation. Results There was no significant difference between the four groups in first theoretical examination ( P  > 0.05); the second theoretical scores of the V-J and J-V group (62.90 ± 3.70, 60.05 ± 2.73) were significantly higher than the first time (57.05 ± 3.92, P  < 0.05), while no difference between the V (57.10 ± 3.66) and J (56.89 ± 2.67) groups was found. Thus, the combination of V-J was effective in improving students’ theoretical scores. The V-J and J-V groups had higher scores on operation (73.98 ± 4.58, 71.85 ± 4.67) and showed better implant precision. Conclusion Virtual simulation education, especially with a jaw simulation model, could improve students’ implantology achievements and training. Currently study found that the V-J group may performed better than the J-V group in oral implant teaching.",BMC Medical Education,journal,f8577c85-ad24-40a3-b6d3-c70fb53037ba,BMC Medical Education,,20,,2020,2020-03-10 00:00:00,"Baoping Zhang, Sihong Li, Shuting Gao, Ming-fu Hou, Hong Chen, Lulu He, Yiting Li, Yumeng Guo, Errui Wang, Rui Cao, Jingyang Cheng, Ruiping Li, Kailiang Zhang","49846804, 12374385, 122732980, 115320424, 2118061072, 50671256, 1918733569, 1908563157, 2113761647, 1912439709, 1910110603, 1908553026, 46459306",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ef3952cc6ad0d19126ec45d264043e7b35a08665,"Education, Medicine",49846804,['JournalArticle'],26.0,39.0

To investigate the effect of flipped classroom approach on teaching evidence-based medicine to medical technology students, we conducted a tailor-made six flipped classroom based EBM courses for medical technology students. This study adopted a qusai-experimental design with 62 medical technology interns as the research object. Students in the experimental group attended the flipped classroom course, while students in the control group attended the traditional course. The learning outcomes were evaluated by Fresno test in both groups. Furthermore, to understand student’s perceptions on the flipped classroom approach, students in the experimental group were required to fill in a satisfaction survey and answer some open-ended questions. The Fresno test scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than that of the control group. From the results of the satisfaction survey, we know that students were satisfied with this course format. Students claimed that the flipped classroom approach could improve their learning efficiency and the interactions with teacher could help them to think more deeply. To conclude, most students showed positive attitudes and views on flipped classroom strategy. Moreover, students’ questions were solved more effectively during class resulting in an improvement of effectiveness of evidence-based medicine trainings.",BMC Medical Education,journal,f8577c85-ad24-40a3-b6d3-c70fb53037ba,BMC Medical Education,,20,,2020,2020-01-31 00:00:00,"Hsien-Li Huang, Chia-Pei Chou, S.

Machine learning based techniques, in particular deep neural networks, can provide a viable alternative to maximum-likelihood methods. However, most common neural network architectures were developed for other domains such as image recogntion. While these methods can enhance the reconstruction performance in IceCube, there is much potential for tailored techniques. In the typical physics use-case, many symmetries, invariances and prior knowledge exist in the data, which are not fully exploited by current network architectures. Novel and specialized deep learning based reconstruction techniques are desired which can leverage the physics potential of experiments like IceCube.
A reconstruction method using convolutional neural networks is presented which can significantly increase the reconstruction accuracy while greatly reducing the runtime in comparison to standard reconstruction methods in Ice- Cube. In addition, first results are discussed for future developments based on generative neural networks.",EPJ Web of Conferences,journal,f2cc63fa-90cb-413d-92ce-003d5244a1e8,EPJ Web of Conferences,,,,2019,2019-10-01 00:00:00,Mirco Hünnefeld,8185612,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b5378514457d040b7f8299d3799d25786e190e2,"Computer Science, Physics",8185612,['Conference'],10.0,10.0

Studies have focused on chemical analysis of biofluids for PMI estimation; however, no reports using spectroscopic methods in pericardial fluid (PF) are available. In this study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory was applied to collect comprehensive biochemical information from rabbit PF at different PMIs. The PMI-dependent spectral signature was determined by two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis. The partial least square (PLS) and nu-support vector machine (nu-SVM) models were then established based on the acquired spectral dataset. Spectral variables associated with amide I, amide II, COO−, C-H bending, and C-O or C-OH vibrations arising from proteins, polypeptides, amino acids and carbohydrates, respectively, were susceptible to PMI in 2D correlation analysis. Moreover, the nu-SVM model appeared to achieve a more satisfactory prediction than the PLS model in calibration; the reliability of both models was determined in an external validation set. The study shows the possibility of application of ATR-FTIR methods in postmortem interval estimation using PF samples.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,7,,2017,2017-12-01 00:00:00,"Ji Zhang, Bing Li, Qi Wang, Xin Wei, Weibo Feng, Yijiu Chen, Ping Huang, Zhenyuan Wang","2116922101, 2172163915, 2151570882, 1804288415, 31902504, 67105920, 145762987, 40976475",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17e9bdcd1d911a0093b561224548705c5b787fc2,"Chemistry, Materials Science, Medicine",2116922101,['JournalArticle'],42.0,44.0

Temperature is believed to be the most important and can be connected to decomposition by using the accumulated degree days (ADD). The aim of this research was to develop a decomposition scoring method and to develop a formula to estimate the PMI by using the developed decomposition scoring method and ADD.A decomposition scoring method and a Book of Reference (visual resource) were made. Ninety-one cases were used to develop a method to estimate the PMI. The photographs were scored using the decomposition scoring method. The temperature data was provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. The PMI was estimated using the total decomposition score (TDS) and using the TDS and ADD. The latter required an additional step, namely to calculate the ADD from the finding date back until the predicted day of death.The developed decomposition scoring method had a high interrater reliability. The TDS significantly estimates the PMI (R2 = 0.67 and 0.80 for indoor and outdoor bodies, respectively). When using the ADD, the R2 decreased to 0.66 and 0.56.The developed decomposition scoring method is a practical method to measure decomposition for human remains found on land. The PMI can be estimated using this method, but caution is advised in cases with a long PMI. The ADD does not account for all the heat present in a decomposing remain and is therefore a possible bias.",Zeitschrift für Rechtsmedizin,journal,dd627ab5-e30c-4f0d-b7d9-7faae870f6f0,International Journal of Legal Medicine,863 - 873,132,,2017,2017-11-06 00:00:00,"H.

However, most of the applied methods have practical limitations or provide insufficient results under certain circumstances. Thus, new methods that can easily be implemented into forensic routine work are required to deliver more and discrete information about the postmortem interval (PMI). Following a previous work on skeletal muscle degradation in the porcine model, we analyzed human postmortem skeletal muscle samples of 40 forensic cases by Western blotting and casein zymography. Our results demonstrate predictable protein degradation processes in human muscle that are distinctly associated with temperature and the PMI. We provide information on promising degradation markers for certain periods of time postmortem, which can be useful tools for time since death delimitation. In addition, we discuss external influencing factors such as age, body mass index, sex, and cause of death that need to be considered in future routine application of the method in humans.",Zeitschrift für Rechtsmedizin,journal,dd627ab5-e30c-4f0d-b7d9-7faae870f6f0,International Journal of Legal Medicine,1547 - 1555,130,,2016,2016-03-07 00:00:00,"S.

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,PLoS ONE,,15,,2020,2020-02-04 00:00:00,"Gurjit S.

The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) of the Sentinel-3 satellites program is capable of providing images for the monitoring of such waters. Atmospheric correction is a necessary process in order to retrieve the desired surface-leaving radiance signal and several atmospheric correction methods have been developed through the years. However, many of these correction methods require programming language skills, or function as commercial software plugins, limiting their possibility of use by end users. Accordingly, in this study, the free SNAP software provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to evaluate the possible differences between a partial atmospheric correction method accounting for Rayleigh scattering and a full atmospheric correction method (iCOR), applied on Sentinel-3 OLCI images of a shallow, highly eutrophic water reservoir. For the complete evaluation of the two methods, in addition to the comparison of the band reflectance values, chlorophyll (CHL) and cyanobacteria (CI) indices were also calculated and their values were intercompared. The results showed, that although the absolute values between the two correction methods did not coincide, there was a very good correlation between the two methods for both bands’ reflectance (r > 0.73) and the CHL and CI indices values (r > 0.95). Therefore, since iCOR correction image processing time is 25 times longer than Rayleigh correction, it is proposed that the Rayleigh partial correction method may be alternatively used for seasonal water monitoring, especially in cases of long time-series, enhancing time and resources use efficiency. Further comparisons of the two methods in other inland water bodies and evaluation with in situ chlorophyll and cyanobacteria measurements will enhance the applicability of the methodology.",PeerJ,journal,558a3215-8ffd-4b31-be7f-f653ca3b600d,PeerJ,,10,,2022,2022-11-04 00:00:00,"Stefanos Katsoulis-Dimitriou, Marios Lefkaditis, Sotirios Barmpagiannakos, K.

Catchment and water management, organisations, industry, farmers and local governments are all confronting the effects of climate change, which stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria and affect the efficacy of adaptation measures in water systems. To tackle climate change and CyanoHABs growth, actors at different levels require both ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ assessments to help them in formulating and implementing adaptation measures. Potential solutions must also be assessed locally to limit associated adverse effects, in particular, negative effects on water quality. Thus, having a better understanding of the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between adaptation practices and climate-change effects on CyanoHABs makes a valuable contribution to a more integrated climate policy and the effective climate-proofing of our water bodies. This article examines adaptation practices focused on tackling CyanoHABs occurrence in a changing climate. It fills an important gap between a major environmental problem and potential solutions. The practices and measures advanced as a result of the analysis can be used by persons with different expertise and skill levels for improving the relevant institutional frameworks and policies to protect their local water bodies.",Marine and Freshwater Research,journal,685bc85c-a614-4c26-be69-3ba06cb999c9,Marine and Freshwater Research,,,,2021,2021-08-26 00:00:00,"A.

Recently, as deep learning models have become more common, RNNs have been used to forecast increasingly complicated systems. Dynamical spatio-temporal processes represent a class of complex systems that can potentially benefit from these types of models. Although the RNN literature is expansive and highly developed, uncertainty quantification is often ignored. Even when considered, the uncertainty is generally quantified without the use of a rigorous framework, such as a fully Bayesian setting. Here we attempt to quantify uncertainty in a more formal framework while maintaining the forecast accuracy that makes these models appealing, by presenting a Bayesian RNN model for nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting. Additionally, we make simple modifications to the basic RNN to help accommodate the unique nature of nonlinear spatio-temporal data. The proposed model is applied to a Lorenz simulation and two real-world nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting applications.",Entropy,journal,8270cfe1-3713-4325-a7bd-c6a87eed889e,Entropy,,21,,2017,2017-11-02 00:00:00,"Patrick L.

However, the intermittent and unstable nature of PM2.5 concentration series makes its forecasting become a very difficult task. In order to improve the forecast accuracy of PM2.5 concentration, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on wavelet transform (WT), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and back propagation (BP) neural network optimized by differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Firstly, WT is employed to disassemble the PM2.5 concentration series into a number of subsets with different frequencies. Secondly, VMD is applied to decompose each subset into a set of variational modes (VMs). Thirdly, DE-BP model is utilized to forecast all the VMs. Fourthly, the forecast value of each subset is obtained through aggregating the forecast results of all the VMs obtained from VMD decomposition of this subset. Finally, the final forecast series of PM2.5 concentration is obtained by adding up the forecast values of all subsets. Two PM2.5 concentration series collected from Wuhan and Tianjin, respectively, located in China are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms all the other considered models in this paper.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,14,,2017,2017-07-01 00:00:00,"Deyun Wang, Yanling Liu, Hongyuan Luo, Chenqiang Yue, Sheng Cheng","51327731, 2143096740, 48541761, 50768886, 2111151448",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1ea839f94c1a492baa80ac39bf0a5885b0e789e,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science, Medicine",51327731,['JournalArticle'],33.0,45.0

Patients with LABC from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiomics features were extracted from enhanced MRI. We constructed the radiomics score using lasso and assessed its prognostic value. An external validation cohort from The Cancer Imaging Archive was used to assess phenotype reproducibility. Sequencing data from TCGA and our center were applied to reveal genomic landscape of different radiomics score groups. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes map and bioinformatics methods were applied to evaluate the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment. Computational histopathology was also applied. A total of 278 patients were divided into training cohort and validation cohort. Radiomics score was constructed and significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients in training cohort, validation cohort and external validation cohort (p < 0.001, p = 0.014 and p = 0.041, respectively). The radiomics-based nomogram showed better predictive performance of DFS compared with TNM model. Distinct gene expression patterns were identified. Immunophenotype and immune cell composition was different in each radiomics score group. The link between radiomics and computational histopathology was revealed. The radiomics score could effectively predict prognosis of LABC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Despite PD-L1 expression being the standard biomarker used before the start of therapy, there is still a strict need to identify complementary non-invasive biomarkers in order to better select patients. In this context, radiomics is an emerging approach for examining medical images and clinical data by capturing multiple features hidden from human eye and is potentially able to predict response assessment and survival in the course of immunotherapy. We reviewed the available studies investigating the role of radiomics in cancer patients, focusing on non-small cell lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although preliminary research shows encouraging results, different issues need to be solved before radiomics can enter into clinical practice. Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have demonstrated encouraging results in terms of durable clinical benefit and survival in several malignancies. Nevertheless, the search to identify an “ideal” biomarker for predicting response to ICI is still far from over. Radiomics is a new translational field of study aiming to extract, by dedicated software, several features from a given medical image, ranging from intensity distribution and spatial heterogeneity to higher-order statistical parameters. Based on these premises, our review aims to summarize the current status of radiomics as a potential predictor of clinical response following immunotherapy treatment. A comprehensive search of PubMed results was conducted. All studies published in English up to and including December 2021 were selected, comprising those that explored computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) for radiomic analyses in the setting of ICI. Several studies have demonstrated the potential applicability of radiomic features in the monitoring of the therapeutic response beyond the traditional morphologic and metabolic criteria, as well as in the prediction of survival or non-invasive assessment of the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, important limitations emerge from our review in terms of standardization in feature selection, data sharing, and methods, as well as in external validation. Additionally, there is still need for prospective clinical trials to confirm the potential significant role of radiomics during immunotherapy.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,journal,7fe84005-586f-4604-98ee-fa60fe8ae618,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,11,,2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,"A.

A prior validation of the immunoscore for breast cancer (ISBC) was made on the basis of a systematic assessment of immune landscapes extrapolated from a large number of neoplastic transcripts. Our goal was to develop a non-invasive radiomics-based ISBC predictive factor. Methods Immunocell fractions of 22 different categories were evaluated using CIBERSORT on the basis of a large, open breast cancer cohort derived from comprehensive information on gene expression. The ISBC was constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model derived from the Immunocell type scores, with 479 quantified features in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions as observed from DCE-MRI. A radiomics signature [radiomics ImmunoScore (RIS)] was developed for the prediction of ISBC using a random forest machine-learning algorithm, and we further evaluated its relationship with prognosis. Results An ISBC consisting of seven different immune cells was established through the use of a LASSO model. Multivariate analyses showed that the ISBC was an independent risk factor in prognosis (HR=2.42, with a 95% CI of 1.49–3.93; P<0.01). A radiomic signature of 21 features of the ISBC was then exploited and validated (the areas under the curve [AUC] were 0.899 and 0.815). We uncovered statistical associations between the RIS signature with recurrence-free and overall survival rates (both P<0.05). Conclusions The RIS is a valuable instrument with which to assess the immunoscore, and offers important implications for the prognosis of breast cancer.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,12,,2022,2022-01-03 00:00:00,"Xiaorui Han, W.

This pilot study shows that radiomics analysis coupled with machine learning of DCE-MRI is a promising approach to derive prognostic and predictive information and to select patients who could benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. This technique could also be used to monitor PD-L1 expression, as it can vary over time and between different regions of the tumor, thus avoiding repeated biopsies. Abstract The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess whether radiomics analysis coupled with machine learning (ML) based on standard-of-care dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can predict PD-L1 expression status in patients with triple negative breast cancer, and to compare the performance of this approach with radiologist review. Patients with biopsy-proven triple negative breast cancer who underwent pre-treatment breast MRI and whose PD-L1 status was available were included. Following 3D tumor segmentation and extraction of radiomic features, radiomic features with significant differences between PD-L1+ and PD-L1− patients were determined, and a final predictive model to predict PD-L1 status was developed using a coarse decision tree and five-fold cross-validation. Separately, all lesions were qualitatively assessed by two radiologists independently according to the BI-RADS lexicon. Of 62 women (mean age 47, range 31–81), 27 had PD-L1− tumors and 35 had PD-L1+ tumors. The final radiomics model to predict PD-L1 status utilized three MRI parameters, i.e., variance (FO), run length variance (RLM), and large zone low grey level emphasis (LZLGLE), for a sensitivity of 90.7%, specificity of 85.1%, and diagnostic accuracy of 88.2%. There were no significant associations between qualitative assessed DCE-MRI imaging features and PD-L1 status. Thus, radiomics analysis coupled with ML based on standard-of-care DCE-MRI is a promising approach to derive prognostic and predictive information and to select patients who could benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.",Cancers,journal,d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,13,,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,"Roberto Lo Gullo, H.

The immunological components within tumors, termed the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), have long been shown to be strongly related to tumor development, recurrence and metastasis. However, conventional studies that underestimate the potential value of the spatial architecture of the TIME are unable to completely elucidate its complexity. As innovative high-flux and high-dimensional technologies emerge, researchers can more feasibly and accurately detect and depict the spatial architecture of the TIME. These findings have improved our understanding of the complexity and role of the TIME in tumor biology. In this review, we first epitomized some representative emerging technologies in the study of the spatial architecture of the TIME and categorized the description methods used to characterize these structures. Then, we determined the functions of the spatial architecture of the TIME in tumor biology and the effects of the gradient of extracellular nonspecific chemicals (ENSCs) on the TIME. We also discussed the potential clinical value of our understanding of the spatial architectures of the TIME, as well as current limitations and future prospects in this novel field. This review will bring spatial architectures of the TIME, an emerging dimension of tumor ecosystem research, to the attention of more researchers and promote its application in tumor research and clinical practice.",Journal of Hematology & Oncology,journal,719730f8-81cf-406a-9c5b-5f991306512a,Journal of Hematology & Oncology,,14,,2021,2021-06-25 00:00:00,"Tong Fu, Lei Dai, Songyang Wu, Yi Xiao, D.

Thus, new anti-ASFV drugs need to be urgently identified. Recently, we identified pentagastrin as a potential antiviral drug against ASFVs using molecular docking and machine learning models. However, the scoring functions are easily influenced by properties of protein pockets, resulting in a scoring bias. Here, we employed the 5′-P binding pocket of AsfvPolX as a potential binding site to identify antiviral drugs and classified 13 AsfvPolX structures into three classes based on pocket parameters calculated by the SiteMap module. We then applied principal component analysis to eliminate this scoring bias, which was effective in making the SP Glide score more balanced between 13 AsfvPolX structures in the dataset. As a result, we identified cangrelor and fostamatinib as potential antiviral drugs against ASFVs. Furthermore, the classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein can provide an alternative approach to identify novel antiviral drugs by optimizing the scoring function of the docking programs. Here, we report a machine learning-based novel approach to generate high binding affinity compounds that are individually matched to the available classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,22,,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,"Jiwon Choi, D.

Consisting of four layers of protein shells and an inner genome, its structure is obviously more complicated than many other viruses, and its multi-layered structures play different kinds of roles in ASFV replication and survival. Each layer possesses many proteins, but very few of the proteins have been investigated at a structural level. Here, we concluded all the ASFV proteins whose structures were unveiled, and explained their functions from the view of structures. Those structures include ASFV AP endonuclease, dUTPases (E165R), pS273R protease, core shell proteins p15 and p35, non-structural proteins pA151R, pNP868R (RNA guanylyltransferase), major capsid protein p72 (gene B646L), Bcl-2-like protein A179L, histone-like protein pA104R, sulfhydryl oxidase pB119L, polymerase X and ligase.

Currently known flavonoids with anti-ASFV activity demonstrate a wide range of antiviral mechanisms, which motivates exploration of new antiviral candidates within this class. The objective of this study was to determine whether other flavonoids may significantly inhibit ASFV infection in vitro. We performed a cell-based library screen of 90 flavonoids. Our screening method allowed us to track the development of virus-induced cytopathic effect by MTT in the presence of tested flavonoids. This screening method was shown to be robust for hit identification, with an average Z-factor of 0.683. We identified nine compounds that inhibit ASFV Ba71V strain in Vero cells. Among them, kaempferol was the most potent and exhibited dose-dependent inhibition, which occurred through a virostatic effect. Time-of-addition studies revealed that kaempferol acts on the entry and post-entry stages of the ASFV replication cycle and impairs viral protein and DNA synthesis. It was further identified that kaempferol induces autophagy in ASFV-infected Vero cells, which is related to its antiviral activity and could be partially abrogated by the addition of an autophagy inhibitor. Kaempferol also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of a highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate in porcine macrophages. Together, these findings support that kaempferol is a promising anti-ASFV agent and has a distinct antiviral mechanism compared to other anti-ASFV flavonoids.",Frontiers in Microbiology,journal,25a655e4-17da-4bfc-a246-5cd20202068d,Frontiers in Microbiology,,12,,2021,2021-10-21 00:00:00,"E.

Since the first diagnosed ASF case in China on August 3, 2018, it has caused huge economic losses to animal husbandry. ASF is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), which is the only member of Asfarviridae family. ASFV is and the only insect-borne DNA virus belonging to the Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) family with an icosahedral structure and an envelope.

Unfortunately, there is currently no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein–protein interactions between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of protein–protein interactions from multiple sources. Thirty-eight swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as ASFV-interacting swine proteins. The ASFV-interacting swine proteins were found to play a central role in the swine protein–protein interaction network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of ASFV-interacting swine proteins also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on ASFV-interacting swine proteins were identified, such as Polaprezinc and Geldanamycin.

In this work, we show how deep learning can be used to advance the research field of photochemistry by learning all important properties—multiple energies, forces, and different couplings—for photodynamics simulations. We simplify such simulations substantially by (i) a phase-free training skipping costly preprocessing of raw quantum chemistry data; (ii) rotationally covariant nonadiabatic couplings, which can either be trained or (iii) alternatively be approximated from only ML potentials, their gradients, and Hessians; and (iv) incorporating spin–orbit couplings. As the deep-learning method, we employ SchNet with its automatically determined representation of molecular structures and extend it for multiple electronic states. In combination with the molecular dynamics program SHARC, our approach termed SchNarc is tested on two polyatomic molecules and paves the way toward efficient photodynamics simulations of complex systems.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,journal,45c7ef3c-e436-428b-a856-c8d5b31b603b,The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,3828 - 3834,11,,2020,2020-02-17 00:00:00,"Julia Westermayr, M.

However, the pervasiveness of web browsing in our daily life does not come without security risks. This widespread practice of web browsing in combination with web users’ low situational awareness against cyber attacks, exposes them to a variety of threats, such as phishing, malware and profiling. Phishing attacks can compromise a target, individual or enterprise, through social interaction alone. Moreover, in the current threat landscape phishing attacks typically serve as an attack vector or initial step in a more complex campaign. To make matters worse, past work has demonstrated the inability of denylists, which are the default phishing countermeasure, to protect users from the dynamic nature of phishing URLs. In this context, our work uses supervised machine learning to block phishing attacks, based on a novel combination of features that are extracted solely from the URL. We evaluate our performance over time with a dataset which consists of active phishing attacks and compare it with Google Safe Browsing (GSB), i.e., the default security control in most popular web browsers. We find that our work outperforms GSB in all of our experiments, as well as performs well even against phishing URLs which are active one year after our model’s training.",Future Internet,journal,c3e5f1c8-9ba7-47e5-acde-53063a69d483,Future Internet,154,13,,2021,2021-06-13 00:00:00,"Andrei M.

The financial sector is the primary target of phishing, and there are many different approaches to combat phishing attacks. Software-based detection approaches are more prominent in phishing detection; however, still, there is no robust solution that can stable for a long period. The primary purpose of this paper is to propose a novel solution to detect phishing attacks using a combined model of LSTM and CNN deep networks with the use of both URLs and HTML pages. The URLs are learned using an LSTM network with 1D convolutional, and another 1D convolutional network is used to learn the HTML features. These two networks were trained separately and combined through a sigmoid layer by dropping the last layer of each model to have the proposed model. The proposed model reached 98.34% in terms of accuracy, and that is above the previously recorded highest accuracy of 97.3% among the detection models used both URL and HTML features in the explored literature. The solution requires feature extraction only with HTML pages, and URLs were directly fed with a minimum pre-processing. Although the proposed solution uses extracted HTML features, those do not depend on third-party services. Therefore, an efficient real-time application can be implemented using the proposed model to detect phishing attacks to safeguard Internet users.",International Journal of Advances in Applied Sciences,journal,58f3d4ea-da1a-4755-85de-db89c331483c,International Journal of ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES,,,,2020,2020-07-01 00:00:00,Ariyadasa et al.,2136758782,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0b3ed9172c5c011cd578b895fed056e28fa20da,Computer Science,2136758782,,16.0,50.0

Phishing includes sending a user an email, or causing a phishing page to steal personal information from a user. Blacklist-based detection techniques can detect this form of attack; however, these approaches have certain limitations, and the number of people affecting have continued to grow. The aim of a technique for phishing detection using machine learning to identify each URL into either a legitimate URL or a phished URL. Data availability here in this proposed solution is the key to executing the solution and if there is any issue with data availability it can cost the project accuracy. Data used for model testing must be reliable and appropriate to almost identify all the websites that the user wants to check. Model consistency is another factor that may trigger project failure so the model has to be accurate in determining a true identity of URLs. This technique employs features of a standardized resource locator (URL). The features have been defined which contain URLs for the phishing site. The suggested approach employs certain characteristics to detect phishing. The strategy was tested with a data collection of 3,000 URLs for the phishing site and 3,000 valid URLs for the site. The findings show that more than 90 percent of phishing sites can be identified by the proposed technique",International journal of recent technology and engineering,journal,8d848812-c4dd-4524-a6ac-5f5822355b19,International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering,,,,2020,2020-05-30 00:00:00,"Associate Professor Neeraja Koppula, Vrinda Prabhakaram Ganti","2285981985, 2285688416",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5efe81c383a4601a654ac9724371d694a75e8278,"Computer Science, Engineering",2285981985,,1.0,27.0

Based on observations from four monitoring wells, the persistence and periodicities of the loose porous aquifers, and the interrelation between precipitation and groundwater levels was examined based on a number of tools including autocorrelation, cross-correlation, spectral analysis, and wavelet transform. The results show that the groundwater levels at W1 and W2 present a downward trend while those at W3 and W4 show an upward trend. The dominant time period increases from 2.1 years (upstream) to 3.7 years (downstream). The time lags between aquifers and rainfall at W1, W2, W3 and W4 are 139.14 ± 59.76 days (2008–2020), 23.27 ± 12.03 days (2005–2014), 145.01 ± 68.00 days (2007–2020), and 59.22 ± 26.14 days (2005–2019), respectively. The lags for the pumping years are 1.2~2.1 times of those during the years without pumping. The recharge ratio overestimated by the water table fluctuation method decreases from 0.32 at W2 to 0.17 at W4, suggesting that the site W2 has a good potentiality for groundwater recharge.

It is an important factor in managing and sustaining the groundwater resources that are used for drinking water, irrigation, and other purposes. Groundwater level prediction is a critical aspect of water resource management and requires accurate and efficient modelling techniques. This study reviews the most commonly used conventional numerical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting GWL. Significant advancements have been made in terms of prediction efficiency over the last two decades. However, while researchers have primarily focused on predicting monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly GWL, water managers and strategists require multi-year GWL simulations to take effective steps towards ensuring the sustainable supply of groundwater. In this paper, we consider a collection of state-of-the-art theories to develop and design a novel methodology and improve modelling efficiency in this field of evaluation. We examined 109 research articles published from 2008 to 2022 that investigated different modelling techniques. Finally, we concluded that machine learning and deep learning approaches are efficient for modelling GWL. Moreover, we provide possible future research directions and recommendations to enhance the accuracy of GWL prediction models and improve relevant understanding.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2023,2023-02-20 00:00:00,"Junaid Khan, Eunkyu Lee, A.

Identifying risk markers through easily accessible clinical data could help in the initial triage of COVID-19 patients and anticipate a fatal outcome, especially in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged regions. This study aims to identify markers that increase lethality risk in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, based on machine learning (ML) methods. Markers were differentiated by sex and age-group. Methods A total of 11,564 cases of COVID-19 in Mexico were extracted from the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease. Four ML classification methods were trained to predict lethality, and an interpretability approach was used to identify those markers. Results Models based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) yielded the best performance in a test set. This model achieved a sensitivity of 0.91, a specificity of 0.69, a positive predictive value of 0.344, and a negative predictive value of 0.965. For female patients, the leading markers are diabetes and arthralgia. For males, the main markers are chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chest pain. Dyspnea, hypertension, and polypnea increased the risk of death in both sexes. Conclusions ML-based models using an interpretability approach successfully identified risk markers for lethality by sex and age. Our results indicate that age is the strongest demographic factor for a fatal outcome, while all other markers were consistent with previous clinical trials conducted in a Mexican population. The markers identified here could be used as an initial triage, especially in geographic areas with limited resources.",BMC Infectious Diseases,journal,1deb1192-6a27-4823-9578-6aa304bd3cdf,BMC Infectious Diseases,,23,,2023,2023-01-11 00:00:00,"M.

The changes in water levels directly affect the circulation processes of lakes and rivers that control water mixing and bottom sediment resuspension, further affecting water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Thus, these considerations have made the water level monitoring process essential to save the environment. Machine learning hybrid models are emerging robust tools that are successfully applied for water level monitoring. Various models have been developed, and selecting the optimal model would be a lengthy procedure. A timely, detailed, and instructive overview of the models’ concepts and historical uses would be beneficial in preventing researchers from overlooking models’ potential selection and saving significant time on the problem. Thus, recent research on water level prediction using hybrid machines is reviewed in this article to present the “state of the art” on the subject and provide some suggestions on research methodologies and models. This comprehensive study classifies hybrid models into four types algorithm parameter optimisation-based hybrid models (OBH), pre-processing-based hybrid models (PBH), the components combination-based hybrid models (CBH), and hybridisation of parameter optimisation-based with preprocessing-based hybrid models (HOPH); furthermore, it explains the pre-processing of data in detail.

In the region of the most abundant irrigated agriculture, water levels have declined up to 24 m and cones of depression have expanded greatly. Increases in area of irrigated land and groundwater withdrawals in the past 10 years are coeval with water-level declines near the USA-Mexico border. Known areas of groundwater recharge from streamflow infiltration, and springs discharging deep-sourced water, show evidence of net water-level rises in the past 40 years, but declines in the last 10 years, in concert with declining precipitation over the basin. Formerly irrigated lands exhibit water-level rises, suggestive of flattening of cones of depression after cessation of extensive groundwater pumping. Manual water-level measurements are vital for understanding and managing groundwater resources, yet they are expensive and laborious to collect, which has resulted in much fewer data in recent years. Spatiotemporal kriging is more complex in mathematical development and implementation than spatial kriging, but it yields improved precision and accuracy, predictions at times with no data as well as at locations with no data, and fewer artifacts due to changing well networks. Its ability to leverage historical data recommends its use in hydrologic studies dependent on water-level maps and changes in water levels over time.",Hydrogeology Journal,journal,5bf57a66-684a-44ab-9f79-0269b2965318,Hydrogeology Journal,2479 - 2494,30,,2022,2022-10-10 00:00:00,G.

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) have been proven to enhance quality of care by promoting change in prescription practices through antimicrobial selection advice. However, bypassing an initial assessment to determine the existence of an underlying disease that justifies the need of antimicrobial therapy might lead to indiscriminate and often unnecessary prescriptions.MethodsFrom pathology laboratory tests, six biochemical markers were selected and combined with microbiology outcomes from susceptibility tests to create a unique dataset with over one and a half million daily profiles to perform infection risk inference. Outliers were discarded using the inter-quartile range rule and several sampling techniques were studied to tackle the class imbalance problem. The first phase selects the most effective and robust model during training using ten-fold stratified cross-validation. The second phase evaluates the final model after isotonic calibration in scenarios with missing inputs and imbalanced class distributions.ResultsMore than 50% of infected profiles have daily requested laboratory tests for the six biochemical markers with very promising infection inference results: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.80-0.83), sensitivity (0.64-0.75) and specificity (0.92-0.97). Standardization consistently outperforms normalization and sensitivity is enhanced by using the SMOTE sampling technique. Furthermore, models operated without noticeable loss in performance if at least four biomarkers were available.ConclusionThe selected biomarkers comprise enough information to perform infection risk inference with a high degree of confidence even in the presence of incomplete and imbalanced data. Since they are commonly available in hospitals, Clinical Decision Support Systems could benefit from these findings to assist clinicians in deciding whether or not to initiate antimicrobial therapy to improve prescription practices.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,journal,76da9cc5-c5a7-42b4-a250-3e708c5f4980,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,17,,2017,2017-12-08 00:00:00,"Bernard Hernandez, P.

However, due to the nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision‐making by such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black‐box process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on peer‐reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets. Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top model‐agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage, explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model primarily explained tree‐based ensemble machine learning models. The most common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as tree‐based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability, fairness, and trustworthiness of AI‐enabled health systems and medical devices and, ultimately, the quality of care and outcomes.",Cancer Innovation,journal,2b26564e-138e-414c-bfb6-3c706a1f532b,Cancer Innovation,,3,,2024,2024-07-03 00:00:00,"Amirehsan Ghasemi, Soheil Hashtarkhani, David L.

Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations, including underdiagnosis, false positive cases, and overdiagnosis. Indeed, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities, including digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, breast MRI, and, more recently, contrast-enhanced mammography, are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a “one-size-fits-all” approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening. Key Points Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available. Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening. Key recommendations Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach, regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35–40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available, ultrasound can be performed as an alternative, although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited. Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians.",European Radiology,journal,47f41409-58e8-4cf2-b8cb-2470d27e901a,European Radiology,6348 - 6357,34,,2024,2024-04-24 00:00:00,"Magda Marcon, Michael H Fuchsjäger, P.

Recent technological advances in breast cancer treatment offer hope to millions of women in the world. Segmentation of the breast’s Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is one of the necessary tasks in the diagnosis and detection of breast cancer. Currently, a popular deep learning model, U-Net is extensively used in biomedical image segmentation. This article aims to advance the state of the art and conduct a more in-depth analysis with a focus on the use of various U-Net models in lesion detection in women’s breast DCE-MRI. In this article, we perform an empirical study of the effectiveness and efficiency of U-Net and its derived deep learning models including ResUNet, Dense UNet, DUNet, Attention U-Net, UNet++, MultiResUNet, RAUNet, Inception U-Net and U-Net GAN for lesion detection in breast DCE-MRI. All the models are applied to the benchmarked 100 Sagittal T2-Weighted fat-suppressed DCE-MRI slices of 20 patients and their performance is compared. Also, a comparative study has been conducted with V-Net, W-Net, and DeepLabV3+. Non-parametric statistical test Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is used to analyze the significance of the quantitative results. Furthermore, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is used to evaluate overall performance focused on accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F $$_1$$ 1 -score, specificity, Geometric-Mean, DSC, and false-positive rate. The RAUNet segmentation model achieved a high accuracy of 99.76%, sensitivity of 85.04%, precision of 90.21%, and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.04% whereas ResNet achieved 99.62% accuracy, 62.26% sensitivity, 99.56% precision, and 72.86% DSC. ResUNet is found to be the most effective model based on MCDA. On the other hand, U-Net GAN takes the least computational time to perform the segmentation task. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the ResNet model performs better than other models in segmenting the images and lesion detection, though computational time in achieving the objectives varies.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,,2023,2023-12-18 00:00:00,"Sudarshan Saikia, Tapas Si, Darpan Deb, K.

Ancient glass in China mostly consisted of lead glass, and potassium glass is widely believed to be imported abroad. In order to figure out the origin of glass artefacts, it is crucial to define the type of glass products accurately. In contemporary research on the chemical composition of ancient glass products, potassium glass is separated from lead glass primarily by the weight ratio of oxides or the proportion of lead-containing compounds. This approach can be excessively subjective and prone to mistakes while calculating the mass fraction of compounds containing potassium. So, it is better to find out the link between the proportion of glass’s chemical composition and its classifications during the weathering process of the glass products, to develop an effective classification model using machine learning techniques. In this research, we suggest employing the slime mould approach to optimise the parameters of a support vector machine and examine a 69-group glass chemical composition dataset. In addition, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared to those of commonly used classification models: decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and support vector machines optimised by genetic algorithms (GA-SVM). The results of this research indicated that the support vector machine method with the sticky slime mould algorithm strategy is the most effective. On the training set, 100% accuracy was attained, while on the test set, 97.50% accuracy was attained in this research. The research results demonstrate that the support vector machine algorithm combining the slime mould algorithm strategy is capable of providing a trustworthy classification reference for future glass artefacts.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2023,2023-03-14 00:00:00,"Yuheng Guo, Wei Zhan, Weihao Li","46791232, 144267505, 2108712523",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3291d5f8212a1e38afeb5efba6af06244befccba,Materials Science,46791232,,15.0,45.0

The intracellular heat generation and its measurement can also assist in the prediction of the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. However, intracellular thermometry without altering the biochemical reactions and cellular membrane damage is challenging, requiring appropriately biocompatible, nontoxic, and efficient biosensors. Bright, photostable, and functionalized fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) have emerged as excellent probes for intracellular thermometry and magnetometry with the spatial resolution on a nanometer scale. The temperature and magnetic field-dependent luminescence of naturally occurring defects in diamonds are key to high-sensitivity biosensing applications. Alterations in the surface chemistry of FNDs and conjugation with polymer, metallic, and magnetic nanoparticles have opened vast possibilities for drug delivery, diagnosis, nanomedicine, and magnetic hyperthermia. This study covers some recently reported research focusing on intracellular thermometry, magnetic sensing, and emerging applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedical imaging. We extend the application of FNDs as biosensors toward disease diagnosis by using intracellular, stationary, and time-dependent information.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a prediction method of per capita ecological carrying capacity based on the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and long short-term memory (LSTM). First, the method improves the ecological footprint model based on energy analysis and constructs a comprehensive regional ecological data model; considering the complex characteristics of ecological data set, based on the ARIMA network model and LSTM model, a reliable and efficient big data prediction model of per capita ecological carrying capacity is established by analyzing the linear or nonlinear data sets in the data set.

Cloud computing provides different services over the internet, thus eliminating the need for personalized hardware and other resources. Cloud computing environments face some challenges in terms of resource utilization, energy efficiency, heterogeneous resources, etc. Tasks scheduling and virtual machines (VMs) are used as consolidation techniques in order to tackle these issues. Tasks scheduling has been extensively studied in the literature. The problem has been studied with different parameters and objectives. In this article, we address the problem of energy consumption and efficient resource utilization in virtualized cloud data centers. The proposed algorithm is based on task classification and thresholds for efficient scheduling and better resource utilization. In the first phase, workflow tasks are pre-processed to avoid bottlenecks by placing tasks with more dependencies and long execution times in separate queues. In the next step, tasks are classified based on the intensities of the required resources. Finally, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to select the best schedules. Experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Comparative results obtained on benchmark datasets are presented. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over that of the other algorithms to which it was compared in terms of energy consumption, makespan, and load balancing.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2021,2021-06-23 00:00:00,"Nimra Malik, Muhammad Sardaraz, Muhammad Tahir, Babar Shah, Gohar Ali, Fernando Moreira","145433872, 3421647, 2061506769, 2080699552, 1840427122, 152970897",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5738e31f94799cb4cb988e6b439e6437b0a7b020,"Computer Science, Engineering",145433872,,32.0,34.0

In the context of cloud auto-scaling, an important issue is the ability to define and use a resource reservation plan, which enables efficient resource scheduling. If necessary, the plan may allocate new resources upon reservation where a sufficient amount of resources is available. Our solution allows the updating of a reservation plan initially prepared by an administrator. It makes it possible to adapt reservation plans one or more weeks ahead. Hence, it allows time for the administrator to analyze the plan and discover potential problems with resource under-provisioning or over-provisioning, which may prevent server overload in the former case and unnecessary expenses in the latter. It also makes it possible to extract and analyze the knowledge learned, which may provide useful information about resource usage characteristics. The proposed solution is tested on OpenStack using real Wikipedia server traffic data. Experimental results demonstrate that machine learning enables an improvement in resource usage.",Journal of Grid Computing,journal,993eb4fa-4cb7-4aed-980e-20e5298efad0,Journal of Grid Computing,797 - 812,17,,2019,2019-07-13 00:00:00,"B.

Smart homes embedded with smart devices and sensors enabled many context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. This study presents XAI-HAR, a novel XAI-empowered human activity recognition (HAR) approach based on key features identified from the data collected from sensors located at different places in a smart home. XAI-HAR identifies a set of new features (i.e., the total number of sensors used in a specific activity), as physical key features selection (PKFS) based on weighting criteria. Next, it presents statistical key features selection (SKFS) (i.e., mean, standard deviation) to handle the outliers and higher class variance. The proposed XAI-HAR is evaluated using machine learning models, namely, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and deep learning models such as deep neural network (DNN), convolution neural network (CNN), and CNN-based long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of XAI-HAR using RF classifier over all other machine learning and deep learning models. For explainability, XAI-HAR uses Local Interpretable Model Agnostic (LIME) with an RF classifier. XAI-HAR achieves 0.96% of F-score for health and dementia classification and 0.95 and 0.97% for activity recognition of dementia and healthy individuals, respectively.",Frontiers in Public Health,journal,d3dd5449-daa1-4d57-9412-9add6037584f,Frontiers in Public Health,,11,,2023,2023-03-09 00:00:00,"A.

Previous research shows that dog–owner relationship has multifarious effects on dog behavior. However, little is known about the interplay between dog–owner relationship, physical activity of the dog, and affective experiences at the time of the owner leaving home and reunion when the owner comes home. In this paper, we explored how the general (daily, home alone, and over the 2-week study period) physical activity of the dog, and owner's perceptions of the dog's affective state were correlated at those particular moments. Nineteen volunteer dog owners had their dogs (N = 19) wear two activity trackers (ActiGraph wGT2X-GT and FitBark2) for 2 weeks 24 h/day. Prior to the 2-week continuous physical activity measurement period, the owners filled in questionnaires about the dog–owner relationship and the dog behavior. In daily questionnaires, owners described and assessed their own and their perception of the emotion-related experiences of their dog and behavior of the dog at the moment of separation and reunion. The results indicated that the dog–owner relationship has an interplay with the mean daily and weekly physical activity levels of the dog. An indication of strong emotional dog–owner relationship (especially related to the attentiveness of the dog, continuous companionship, and time spent together when relaxing) correlated positively with the mean daily activity levels of the dog during the first measurement week of the study. Results also suggest that the mean daily and over the 2-week measurement period physical activity of the dog correlated the affective experiences of the dog and owner as reported by the owner when the dog was left home alone. More research is needed to understand the interplay between affect, physical activity of the dog, dog–owner relationship, and the effects of these factors on, and their interplay with, the welfare of dogs.",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,journal,d5e0c47e-1f80-41d8-a565-44d86b990db3,Frontiers in Veterinary Science,,8,,2021,2021-12-09 00:00:00,"H.

With recent advances in machine learning and embedded computing, much more nuanced and accurate behavior classification has become possible, giving these affordable consumer devices the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pet healthcare. Here we describe a novel deep learning algorithm that classifies dog behavior at sub-second resolution using commercial pet activity monitors. We built machine learning training databases from over 5,000 videos of over 2,500 dogs and ran the algorithms in production on over 11 million days of device data. We then surveyed project participants representing 10,550 dogs, they provided us 163,110 event responses to validate real-world detection of eating and drinking behavior. The resultant algorithm displayed a sensitivity and specificity for detecting drinking behavior (0.949 and 0.999, respectively) and eating behavior (0.988, 0.983). We also demonstrated detection of licking, petting, rubbing, scratching, and sniffing. We show that the devices’ position on the collar has no measurable impact on performance. In production, users reported a true positive rate of 95.3% for eating (among 1,514 users), and of 94.9% (among 1,491 users) for drinking. The study demonstrates the accurate detection of important health-related canine behaviors using a collar-mounted accelerometer. We trained and validated our algorithms on a large and realistic training dataset, and we assessed and confirmed accuracy in production via user validation.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,,11,,2020,2020-12-14 00:00:00,"Robert D.

The process of evaluating a value for the GMFM index can be time consuming. It typically takes 45 to 60 min for the patient to complete all tasks, sometimes in two or more sessions. The diagnostic procedure requires trained and specialized therapists. The paper presents the estimation of the GMFM measure for patients with cerebral palsy based on the results of the Zebris FDM-T treadmill. For this purpose, the regression analysis was used. Estimations based on the Generalized Linear Regression were assessed using different error metrics. The results obtained showed that the GMFM score can be estimated with acceptable accuracy. Because the Zebris FDM-T is a widely used device in gait rehabilitation, our method has the potential to be widely adopted for objective diagnostics of children with cerebral palsy.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,journal,7fe84005-586f-4604-98ee-fa60fe8ae618,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,11,,2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,"Mariusz Bedla, Paweł Pięta, Daniel Kaczmarski, S.

Gait assessment is one of the essential steps of gait management. It has been widely used for clinical decision making and evaluation of different treatment outcomes. However, most of the present methods of gait assessment are subjective, less sensitive to small pathological changes, time-taking and need a great effort of an expert. This work proposes an automated, comprehensive gait assessment score (A-GAS) for gait disorders in CP. Kinematic data of 356 CP and 41 typically developing subjects is used to validate the performance of A-GAS. For the computation of A-GAS, instance abnormality index (AII) and abnormality index (AI) are calculated. AII quantifies gait abnormality of a gait cycle instance, while AI quantifies gait abnormality of a joint angle profile during walking. AII is calculated for all gait cycle instances by performing probabilistic and statistical analyses. Abnormality index (AI) is a weighted sum of AII, computed for each joint angle profile. A-GAS is a weighted sum of AI, calculated for a lower limb. Moreover, a graphical representation of the gait assessment report, including AII, AI, and A-GAS is generated for providing a better depiction of the assessment score. Furthermore, the work compares A-GAS with a present rating-based gait assessment scores to understand fundamental differences. Finally, A-GAS’s performance is verified for a high-cost multi-camera set-up using nine joint angle profiles and a low-cost single camera set-up using three joint angle profiles. Results show no significant differences in performance of A-GAS for both the set-ups.

4232ee48e7c2408f8c6dddca3d4fca3cee4a7cd8,10.3390/EN14020289,Risk Assessment in Energy Infrastructure Installations by Horizontal Directional Drilling Using Machine Learning,"Nowadays we can observe a growing demand for installations of new gas pipelines in Europe. A large number of them are installed using trenchless Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) technology. The aim of this work was to develop and compare new machine learning models dedicated for risk assessment in HDD projects. The data from 133 HDD projects from eight countries of the world were gathered, profiled, and preprocessed. Three machine learning models, logistic regression, random forests, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were developed to predict the overall HDD project outcome (failure free installation or installation likely to fail), and the occurrence of identified unwanted events. The best performance in terms of recall and accuracy was achieved for the developed ANN model, which proved to be efficient, fast and robust in predicting risks in HDD projects. Machine learning applications in the proposed models enabled eliminating the involvement of a group of experts in the risk assessment process and therefore significantly lower the costs associated with the risk assessment process. Future research may be oriented towards developing a comprehensive risk management system, which will enable dynamic risk assessment taking into account various combinations of risk mitigation actions.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,,2021,2021-01-07 00:00:00,"Maria Krechowicz, Adam Krechowicz","2308018231, 2134270",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4232ee48e7c2408f8c6dddca3d4fca3cee4a7cd8,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",2308018231,,13.0,46.0

Clinical gait analysis (CGA) is used to identify, understand and support the management of gait deviations in CP. Children with CP often use ankle–foot orthosis (AFO) to facilitate and optimize their walking ability. The aim of this study was to assess whether the gait deviation index (GDI) and the gait variability index (GVI) results can reflect the changes of spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters in spastic hemiplegic CP children wearing AFO. Method: The study group consisted of 37 CP children with hemiparesis. All had undergone a comprehensive, instrumented gait analysis while walking, both barefoot and with their AFO, during the same CGA session. Kinematic and spatio-temporal data were collected and GVI and GDI gait indexes were calculated. Results: Significant differences were found between the barefoot condition and the AFO conditions for selected spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters. Changes in GVI and GDI were also statistically significant. Conclusions: The use of AFO in hemiplegic CP children caused a statistically significant improvement in spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters. It was found that these changes were also reflected by GVI and GDI. These findings might suggest that gait indices, such as GDI and GVI, as clinical outcome measures, may reflect the effects of specific therapeutic interventions in CP children.",Children,journal,083c6c99-5d39-4452-88c4-2963e15f8a0f,Children,,7,,2020,2020-09-25 00:00:00,"Majewska Joanna, Szczepanik Magdalena, Bazarnik-Mucha Katarzyna, Szymczyk Daniel, Lenart-Domka Ewa","1990712483, 1990710561, 1990708574, 1990625860, 1990718242",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a221d095c04ab0dcf238693d51c766f8bb91ef8b,"Engineering, Medicine",1990712483,['JournalArticle'],8.0,27.0

Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixty-eight individuals (mean age 13.3 ± 5.7 years; 35% female, 92% Caucasian) were randomized to HCLC followed by SAP therapy (intensive group; N = 48) or to the usual-care group treated with multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy (N = 20). Primary outcome was C-peptide concentrations during mixed-meal tolerance tests at 12 months. RESULTS Intensive-group participants initiated HCLC a median of 6 days after diagnosis for a median duration of 71.3 h, during which median participant mean glucose concentration was 140 mg/dL (interquartile range 134–153 mg/dL). During outpatient SAP, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use decreased over time, and at 12 months, only 33% of intensive participants averaged sensor use ≥6 days/week. In the usual-care group, insulin pump and CGM use were initiated prior to 12 months by 15 and 5 participants, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were similar in both groups throughout the study. At 12 months, the geometric mean (95% CI) of C-peptide area under the curve was 0.43 (0.34–0.52) pmol/mL in the intensive group and 0.52 (0.32–0.75) pmol/mL in the usual-care group (P = 0.49). Thirty-seven (79%) intensive and 16 (80%) usual-care participants had a peak C-peptide concentration ≥0.2 pmol/mL (P = 0.30).

We investigate the distribution of expression data in human cancer genomes and study the implications of deviations from the normal distribution for translational molecular oncology research. Methods We conducted a central moments analysis of five cancer genomes and performed empiric distribution fitting to examine the true distribution of expression data both on the complete-experiment and on the individual-gene levels. We used a variety of parametric and nonparametric methods to test the effects of deviations from normality on gene calling, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification using a sixth cancer genome. Results Central moments analyses reveal statistically-significant deviations from normality in all of the analyzed cancer genomes. We observe as much as 37% variability in gene calling, 39% variability in functional annotation, and 30% variability in prospective, molecular tumor subclassification associated with this effect. Conclusions Cancer gene expression profiles are not normally-distributed, either on the complete-experiment or on the individual-gene level. Instead, they exhibit complex, heavy-tailed distributions characterized by statistically-significant skewness and kurtosis. The non-Gaussian distribution of this data affects identification of differentially-expressed genes, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification. These effects may be reduced in some circumstances, although not completely eliminated, by using nonparametric analytics. This analysis highlights two unreliable assumptions of translational cancer gene expression analysis: that “small” departures from normality in the expression data distributions are analytically-insignificant and that “robust” gene-calling algorithms can fully compensate for these effects.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,7,,2012,2012-10-31 00:00:00,"Nicholas F.

However, effectively training deep learning models typically necessitates substantial quantities of high-quality data, a resource often lacking in numerous medical imaging scenarios. One way to overcome this deficiency is to artificially generate such images. Therefore, in this comparative study we train five generative models to artificially increase the amount of available data in such a scenario. This synthetic data approach is evaluated on a a downstream classification task, predicting four causes for pneumonia as well as healthy cases on 1082 chest X-ray images. Quantitative and medical assessments show that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach significantly outperforms more recent diffusion-based approaches on this limited dataset with better image quality and pathological plausibility. We show that better image quality surprisingly does not translate to improved classification performance by evaluating five different classification models and varying the amount of additional training data. Class-specific metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score show a substantial improvement by using synthetic images, emphasizing the data rebalancing effect of less frequent classes. However, overall performance does not improve for most models and configurations, except for a DreamBooth approach which shows a +0.52 improvement in overall accuracy. The large variance of performance impact in this study suggests a careful consideration of utilizing generative models for limited data scenarios, especially with an unexpected negative correlation between image quality and downstream classification improvement.",Bioengineering,journal,103075b0-1b66-4b69-9c47-f54875634fba,Bioengineering,,10,,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,"Daniel Schaudt, Christian Späte, Reinhold von Schwerin, Manfred Reichert, Marianne von Schwerin, Meinrad Beer, Christopher Kloth","2145260466, 2219655363, 2189632504, 2261720594, 2261719676, 2239385882, 2207671405",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db5ccb1d7e75c23995a42806e8ea2e03b074269d,"Computer Science, Medicine",2145260466,['JournalArticle'],4.0,68.0

The aim is to develop an automatic image processing approach based on two artificial intelligence ( AI ) techniques in intraoral (periapical and bitewing) radiographs to assist dentists in determining bone loss. The first is a deep learning ( DL ) object-detector (YOLOv3) to roughly identify (no exact localization is required) two objects: prosthesis (crown) and implant (screw). The second is an image understanding-based ( IU ) process to fine-tune lines on screw edges and to identify significant points (intensity bone changes, intersections between screw and crown). Distances between these points are used to compute bone loss. A total of 2920 radiographs were used for training (50%) and testing (50%) the DL process. The mAP@0.5 metric is used for performance evaluation of DL considering periapical/bitewing and screws/crowns in upper and lower jaws, with scores ranging from 0.537 to 0.898 (sufficient because DL only needs an approximation). The IU performance is assessed with 50% of the testing radiographs through the t test statistical method, obtaining p values of 0.0106 (line fitting) and 0.0213 (significant point detection). The IU performance is satisfactory, as these values are in accordance with the statistical average/standard deviation in pixels for line fitting (2.75/1.01) and for significant point detection (2.63/1.28) according to the expert criteria of dentists, who establish the ground-truth lines and significant points. In conclusion, AI methods have good prospects for automatic bone loss detection in intraoral radiographs to assist dental specialists in diagnosing peri-implantitis.",Journal of digital imaging,journal,d97d3d34-0bc5-4a81-9542-b39361ecf3aa,Journal of Digital Imaging,2259 - 2277,36,,2023,2023-07-19 00:00:00,"M.

They are therefore involved in the development of persistent pain. One of the main sites of interaction of the immune system with persistent pain has been identified as neuro-immune crosstalk at the glial-opioid interface. The present study examined a potential association between the DNA methylation of two key players of glial/opioid intersection and persistent postoperative pain. In a cohort of 140 women who had undergone breast cancer surgery, and were assigned based on a 3-year follow-up to either a persistent or non-persistent pain phenotype, the role of epigenetic regulation of key players in the glial-opioid interface was assessed. The methylation of genes coding for the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a major mediator of glial contributions to persistent pain or for the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) was analyzed and its association with the pain phenotype was compared with that conferred by global genome-wide DNA methylation assessed via quantification of the methylation in the retrotransposon LINE1. Training of machine learning algorithms indicated that the global DNA methylation provided a similar diagnostic accuracy for persistent pain as previously established non-genetic predictors. However, the diagnosis can be based on a single DNA based marker. By contrast, the methylation of TLR4 or OPRM1 genes could not contribute further to the allocation of the patients to the pain-related phenotype groups. While clearly supporting a predictive utility of epigenetic testing, the present analysis cannot provide support for specific epigenetic modulation of persistent postoperative pain via methylation of two key genes of the glial-opioid interface.",Clinical Epigenetics,journal,310fa781-1f4e-487d-a580-d8e99f5c81b7,Clinical Epigenetics,,11,,2019,2019-11-27 00:00:00,"D.

However, there has been disagreement regarding the factor structure of the GAD-7, and there is a need for larger studies investigating the psychometric properties of the measure. Patients undergoing treatment (N = 1201), both inpatient and outpatient patients, completed the GAD-7 at pre- and post-treatment. Measures of depression, well-being, and other anxiety measures were also completed, making it possible to investigate convergent and divergent validity. Internal consistency and convergent validity were excellent for the total sample, and there was acceptable variation related to treatment groups. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a random sample (50%) of the patients at intake and then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the factor structure in the other part of the sample at intake. The EFA indicated a clear one-factor solution, but the one-factor solution with CFA provided a poor fit to the data. Correlating the residuals among items assessing somatic symptoms led to a good fit in a respecified CFA solution.

We made a review of the literature that used artificial intelligence techniques in kidney transplantation. We located six main areas of kidney transplantation that artificial intelligence studies are focused on: Radiological evaluation of the allograft, pathological evaluation including molecular evaluation of the tissue, prediction of graft survival, optimizing the dose of immunosuppression, diagnosis of rejection, and prediction of early graft function. Machine learning techniques provide increased automation leading to faster evaluation and standardization, and show better performance compared to traditional statistical analysis.

This study aimed at developing a predictor model to estimate time on a kidney transplant waiting list using a machine learning approach. Methods A retrospective cohort study including data of patients registered, between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, in the waiting list of São Paulo State Organ Allocation System (SP-OAS) /Brazil. Data were randomly divided into two groups: 75% for training and 25% for testing. A Cox regression model was fitted with deceased donor transplant as the outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different Cox models. Cox hazard ratios were used to develop the risk-prediction equations. Results Of 54,055 records retrieved, 48,153 registries were included in the final analysis. During the study period, approximately 1/3 of the patients were transplanted with a deceased donor. The major characteristics associated with changes in the likelihood of transplantation were age, subregion, cPRA, and frequency of HLA-DR, -B and -A. The model developed was able to predict waiting time with good agreement in internal validation (c-index = 0.70). Conclusion The kidney transplant waiting time calculator developed shows good predictive performance and provides information that may be valuable in assisting candidates and their providers. Moreover, it can significantly improve the use of economic resources and the management of patient care before transplant.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,16,,2021,2021-05-20 00:00:00,"Juliana Feiman Sapiertein Silva, G.

We retrospectively evaluated the data of kidney transplant procedures until hospital discharge, according to kidney function recovery after the procedure. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the non-sensitized, 1st KTx from deceased donors performed between Jan/2010 to Dec/2017. Results: Out of the 1300 KTx from deceased donors performed in this period, 730 patients were studied and divided into 3 groups: Immediate Renal Function (IRF) - decrease in serum creatinine ≥ 10% on two consecutive days; Delayed Graft Function (DGF) - decrease in serum creatinine <10% on two consecutive days, without the need for dialysis, and Dialysis (D) - need for dialysis during the first week. Patients in group D stayed longer in the hospital compared to DGF and IRF (21, 11 and 8 days respectively, p < 0.001). More D patients (21%) were admitted to the ICU and performed a greater number of laboratory tests (p < 0.001) and renal biopsies (p < 0.001), in addition to receiving a higher amount of immunosuppressants. Total hospital costs were higher in group D and DGF compared to IRF (U$ 7.021,48; U$ 3.603,42 and U$ 2.642,37 respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The costs of the transplant procedure is impacted by the recovery of kidney function after the transplant. The reimbursement for each of these different kidney function outcomes should be individualized in order to cover their real costs.",Jornal Brasileiro De Nefrologia,journal,357835a3-b31b-4c10-af51-1de90b42cee9,Jornal Brasileiro de Nefrologia,375 - 382,43,,2021,2021-04-23 00:00:00,"R.

Despite this success, the high risk of premature death and frequent occurrence of graft failure remain important clinical and research challenges. The current burst of studies and other innovative initiatives using artificial intelligence (AI) for a wide range of analytical and practical applications in biomedical areas seems to correlate with the same trend observed in publications in the kidney transplantation field, and points toward the potential of such novel approaches to address the aforementioned aim of improving long-term outcomes of kidney transplant recipients (KTR). However, at the same time, this trend underscores now more than ever the old methodological challenges and potential threats that the research and clinical community needs to be aware of and actively look after with regard to AI-driven evidence. The purpose of this narrative mini-review is to explore challenges for obtaining applicable and adequate kidney transplant data for analyses using AI techniques to develop prediction models, and to propose next steps in the field. We make a call to act toward establishing the strong collaborations needed to bring innovative synergies further augmented by AI, which have the potential to impact the long-term care of KTR.

In organ transplantation, delayed graft function (DGF) remains a major concern in deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT). To this end, we harnessed ML to build personalized prognostic models to predict DGF. Registry data were obtained on adult DDKT recipients for model development (n = 55,044) and validation (n = 6176). Incidence rates of DGF were 25.1% and 26.3% for the development and validation sets, respectively. Twenty-six predictors were identified via recursive feature elimination with random forest. Five widely-used ML algorithms—logistic regression (LR), elastic net, random forest, artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were trained and compared with a baseline LR model fitted with previously identified risk factors. The new ML models, particularly ANN with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.732 and XGB with ROC-AUC of 0.735, exhibited superior performance to the baseline model (ROC-AUC = 0.705). This study demonstrates the use of ML as a viable strategy to enable personalized risk quantification for medical applications.

Early prediction of subclinical mastitis can enable dairy farmers to perform interventions to mitigate its effect. The present study investigated how well predictive models built using machine learning techniques can detect subclinical mastitis up to 7 d before its occurrence. The data set used consisted of 1,346,207 milk-day (i.e., a day when milk was collected on both morning and evening) records spanning 9 yr from 2,389 cows producing on 7 Irish research farms. Individual cow composite milk yield and maximum milk flow were available twice daily, whereas milk composition (i.e., fat, lactose, protein) and somatic cell count (SCC) were collected once per week. Other features describing parity, calving dates, predicted transmitting ability for SCC, body weight, and history of subclinical mastitis were also available. The results of the study showed that a gradient boosting machine model trained to predict the onset of subclinical mastitis 7 d before a subclinical case occurs achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 69.45 and 95.64%, respectively. Reduced data collection frequency, where milk composition and SCC were recorded only every 15, 30, 45, and 60 d was simulated by masking data, to reflect the frequency of recording of this data on commercial dairy farms in Ireland. The sensitivity and specificity scores reduced as recording frequency reduced with respective scores of 66.93 and 80.43% when milk composition and SCC were recorded just every 60 d. Results demonstrate that models built on data that could be recorded routinely available on commercial dairy farms, can achieve useful predictive ability of subclinical mastitis even with reduced frequency of milk composition and SCC recording.",Journal of Dairy Science,journal,7da561cd-ebc2-42ae-96b3-244a5c401c38,Journal of dairy science,,,,2023,2023-05-31 00:00:00,"A.

The objective was to evaluate UST by infrared thermography (IRT) as a diagnostic tool for SCM and intramammary infection (IMI), and to assess the influence of environmental conditions in the potential diagnosis of this disease in dairy cows located at high-altitude tropical regions. A total of 105 cows (397 quarters) from 3 dairy farms with mechanical and manual milking methods were enrolled in the study. Subclinical mastitis was diagnosed when quarter samples had a somatic cell count (SCC) ≥200 × 103 cells/mL, microbial growth (MG) was defined when a major pathogen (≥1 cfu/plate) or Corynebacterium spp. (≥10 cfu/plate) was isolated, and IMI was defined as the presence of MG and SCC ≥100 × 103 cells/mL. Infrared images were taken with a thermal camera placed 1 m away from the udder, and shots of the rear and left and right lateral view were made during the morning milking, before any manipulation of the udder and employing dark cardboard on the contralateral side to avoid artifacts in the background. A multilevel mixed effects linear regression model clustered within cows and herd was performed to evaluate the associations with UST. Clinical performance was evaluated using the Youden index to establish the optimum UST thresholds, which were set at 32.6°C for any case definition when milking was by hand, at 33.7°C for MG, and at 34°C for SCM and IMI in machine-milked quarters. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), area under curve (AUC), and positive likelihood ratio (+LR) were also assessed. Test agreement was assessed by kappa coefficient (κ). The UST of healthy quarters ranged between (95% CI) 32.4 and 32.6°C, lower than SCM quarters (n = 88) at 32.9°C (95% CI: 32.7-33.1 °C), MG quarters (n = 56) at 33.5°C (95% CI: 33.3-33.7°C), and IMI quarters (n = 50) at 33.5°C (95% CI: 33.2-33.7 °C). The UST was also related to the milking method: higher temperatures were observed for hand milking (n = 90) compared with machine milking (n = 185). No relation between environmental conditions such as wind speed, atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, and temperature-humidity index and UST were observed during this study. For hand milking, the optimal UST threshold was 32.6°C; for SCM, Se = 0.53, Sp = 0.89, AUC = 0.71, κ = 0.4; for MG, Se = 0.83, Sp = 0.93, AUC = 0.88, κ = 0.77; and for IMI, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.92, AUC = 0.87, κ = 0.74. The machine milking threshold for SCM resulted in Se = 0.42, Sp = 0.97, AUC = 0.70, κ = 0.47; for MG, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.89, AUC = 0.85, κ = 0.60; and for IMI, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.98, AUC = 0.90, κ = 0.79. These findings suggest that UST determined by IRT is higher in machine-milked cows and in quarters with MG and IMI than in healthy quarters; therefore, UST by IRT is a reliable, clinically useful method for MG and IMI diagnosis.",Journal of Dairy Science,journal,7da561cd-ebc2-42ae-96b3-244a5c401c38,Journal of dairy science,,,,2021,2021-06-24 00:00:00,"J.

Within the fields of urology and gynecology, conditions such as overactive bladder (OAB) and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) have been identified as crucial concerns due to their negative impact on the quality of life of elderly individuals. In this study, we investigated the potential of Ninjin'yoeito (NYT), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, as a viable treatment option for frailty. Additionally, we hypothesized that NYT may also contribute to the improvement of symptoms associated with OAB and GSM, and potentially help in reducing the dosage of OAB medications. Methods In this retrospective cohort study conducted from November 2016 to November 2022, we created a website describing the relationship between frailty and genitourinary symptoms in frail patients aged ≥ 65 years with GSM who underwent pelvic floor muscle training. The patients were divided into two propensity score-matched groups: NYT group (received NYT for one year) and no-NYT group (did not receive NYT), based on their wishes. The fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight (FRAIL) scale was used to assess frailty status. Urinary symptoms were evaluated using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). Genital symptoms were investigated using the vaginal health index score and vulvodynia swab test. The value of each score was obtained before (T0) and 12 months after (T12) treatment, and the difference (ΔT0/T12) was calculated. Results During the study period, 985 outpatients visited our clinic, of whom 725 were considered frail/pre-frail; 402 women with frailty/pre-frailty (mean age 77.5 ± 6.49 years) were included, with a median follow-up of 14.5 months. The NYT and no-NYT groups had 220 and 182 patients, respectively. After propensity score matching, each group had 159 patients. ΔT0/T12FRAIL scale score was significantly higher in the NYT group (0.13 ± 0.37) than in the no-NYT (0.01 ± 0.10) group (p=0.001.) However, urinary symptoms improved in the NYT group more than in the no-NYT in terms of the following parameters: ΔT0/T12OABSS (NYT: 0.89 ± 1.65; no-NYTl: 0.36 ± 1.14, p=0.001) and ΔT0/T12ICIQ-SF score (NYT: 1.51 ± 1.75; no-NYT: 0.42 ± 1.18, p<0.001). Genital symptoms were better in the NYT group in terms of ΔT0/T12VHIS (NYT: 0.58 ±1.08; no-NYT: 0.21 ±0.65, p<0.001). The vulvodynia swab test showed improvements in left para-hymen evoked pain in both groups. In the NYT group, 5% of the patients underwent antimuscarinic drug dose reduction for overactive bladder treatment. NYT use was not associated with significant side effects, and only 0.6% of patients reported drug allergies. Conclusion NYT improved activity levels in frail/pre-frail patients. Moreover, NYT use improved various genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with frailty/pre-frailty. Treatment with NYT may reduce the dose of overactive bladder medications. The anticholinergic load-reducing effect of NYT may help solve the problem of polypharmacy.",Cureus,journal,87c855fc-c59a-4443-832a-e5b1ca14b9f3,Cureus,,15,,2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,"N. Okui, M.

However, its therapeutic efficacy and safety have not been thoroughly reviewed in elderly patients. This study aims to provide treatment outcomes for patients aged ≥75 years, and to identify factors associated with unfavorable outcomes. Patients receiving intradetrusor injections of 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA for refractory OAB between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Urodynamic parameters, underlying comorbidities, subjective success, and unfavorable outcomes were assessed. A total of 192 patients were included, and 65 of them were classified into the elderly group. For the elderly group, 60.0% experienced subjective dryness, and 84.6% remained subjective success at 6 months after the injections. The prevalence rates of common unfavorable outcomes, including urinary tract infections, large post-void residual urine volume, and urinary retention, were 9.2%, 27.7%, and 12.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that female, baseline urodynamic parameters, and diabetes mellitus were associated with unfavorable outcomes in the elderly group.

To address this issue, more and more researchers are examining the relationship between OAB treatment and urinary microecology. In this study, we sought to determine whether differences in treatment efficacy were related to microbiome diversity and composition as well as the abundance of specific genera. Machine learning algorithms were used to construct predictive models for urine microbiota-based treatment of OAB. Methods Urine samples were obtained from 64 adult female OAB patients for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients’ overactive bladder symptom scores (OABSS) were collected before and after mirabegron treatment and patients were divided into effective and ineffective groups. The relationship between the relative abundance of certain genera and OABSS were analyzed. Three machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), supporting vector machine (SVM) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were utilized to predict the therapeutic effect of mirabegron based on the relative abundance of certain genera in OAB patients’ urine microbiome. Results The species composition of the two groups differed. For one, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly higher in the effective group than in the ineffective group. In addition, the relative abundance of Gardnerella and Prevotella in the effective group was significantly lower than in the ineffective group. Alpha-diversity and beta-diversity differed significantly between the two groups. LEfSe analysis revealed that Lactobacillus abundance increased while Prevotella and Gardnerella abundance decreased in the effective group. The Lactobacillus abundance ROC curve had high predictive accuracy. The OABSS after treatment was negatively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus, whereas the relationship between OABSS and Prevotella and Gardnerella showed the opposite trend. In addition, RF, SVM and XGBoost models demonstrated high predictive ability to assess the effect of mirabegron in OAB patients in the test cohort. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that urinary microbiota might influence the efficacy of mirabegron, and that Lactobacillus might be a potential marker for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of mirabegron in OAB patients.",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,journal,a19f6357-d8f7-4235-8304-c659c68ca126,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,12,,2022,2022-11-14 00:00:00,"Zhipeng Zhou, Yifeng Qiu, Kun Li, Qi Sun, Ming Xie, Pengcheng Huang, Y.

Given the rapidly increasing proportion of older adults in Japan, a better understanding of the relationship between frailty and OAB is needed to inform future healthcare planning. This study assessed the association between frailty and OAB in older adults in Japan and evaluated the impact on their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods This was a cross-sectional re-contact study of respondents who previously completed the National Health and Wellness Survey 2018 in Japan. Participants were aged ≥65 years and Japanese speakers and readers. As part of a customized online survey, participants were screened for frailty using the Kihon Checklist (frail = scores ≥8 points) and OAB using the overactive bladder symptom score (OAB = total score ≥ 3 points and ≥ 2 points on question 3). The primary endpoint was the odds ratio of frailty in older adults with and without OAB assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model. Secondary endpoints were the prevalence rates of OAB and frailty. Exploratory endpoints assessed HRQoL using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Survey Instrument version 2 (SF-12v2). Results Overall, 2953 participants were included: 150 (5.1%) were frail OAB, 416 (14.1%) non-frail OAB, 287 (9.7%) frail non-OAB, and 2100 (71.1%) non-frail non-OAB. There was a statistically significant correlation between frailty and OAB demonstrated by an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.78 (2.18–3.54; p  <  0.001). The prevalence (95% CI) of OAB was 34.3% (29.9–38.8) in frail and 16.5% (15.1–18.0) in non-frail older adults; the prevalence of frailty was 26.5% (22.9–30.1) and 12.0% (10.7–13.3) in older adults with and without OAB. HRQoL was assessed in 150 participants per group. The adjusted HRQoL analyses showed significantly lower scores in participants who were frail OAB vs. frail non-OAB for most of the SF-12v2 scores/sub-component scores. Conclusions These data highlight the statistically significant positive correlation between frailty and OAB among older adults in Japan and may provide valuable information on the burden of OAB and frailty on older adults to healthcare professionals when considering future healthcare planning.",BMC Geriatrics,journal,f0ed97d4-5d9b-4cb1-892a-ae0f91b368bc,BMC Geriatrics,,22,,2022,2022-01-21 00:00:00,"Masaki Yoshida, S.

Methods PD-L1 and mismatch repair protein (MMR) expression in cancer cells and the density of TAIC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 89 SCNEC patients. The combined positive score (CPS), tumor proportion score (TPS), and immune cell score (ICS) of PD-L1 were measured, along with their correlation with clinicopathologic features in SCNEC patients using statistical analyses. Results CPS of PD-L1 ≥ 1 was seen in 68.5% of patients, positive TPS and ICS of PD-L1 were detected in 59.6% and 33.7% of patients, respectively. PD-L1 CPS was higher in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (r = 0.387, p  = 0.001) and positively correlated with programmed cell death-1 and forkhead box P3 + regulatory T cell (FOXP3 + Treg) infiltration (r = 0.443, p  < 0.001; r = 0.532, p  < 0.001). There was no statistical correlation between PD-L1 and MMR status. PD-L1 CPS and PD-L1 ICS positivity were independent prognostic factors, correlating with a favorable survival (HR (95%CI) = 0.363(0.139–0.950), p  = 0.039 and HR (95% CI) = 0.199(0.050–0.802), p  = 0.023, respectively). PD-L1 ICS positivity was an independent indicator of recurrence in SCNEC patients and associated with better disease-free survival (HR (95% CI) = 0.124(0.036–0425), p  = 0.001). TAIC and MMR levels had no statistical impact on survival results. Conclusions PD-L1 positivity was seen in over half of SCNEC tumors. It may work synergistically with FOXP3 + Treg and other infiltrating immune cells to support an adaptive immune response. PD-L1 positivity may be a favorable prognostic factor in SCNEC.",Cancer Cell International,journal,f8480fcc-dd9e-4c09-9baf-78df5a6881cd,Cancer Cell International,,22,,2022,2022-11-14 00:00:00,"Xiaoying Sun, Lili Liu, T.

Methods A total of 11,370 computed tomograms (CT), deriving from 137 cases, of lung cancer patients under radiotherapy developed by radiotherapists were used as the training set; 1642 CT images in 20 cases were used as the validation set, and 1685 CT images in 20 cases were used as the test set. The proposed network was tuned and trained to obtain the best segmentation model and its performance was measured by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and with 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95). Lastly, as to demonstrate the accuracy of the automatic segmentation of the network proposed in this study, all possible mirrors of the input images were put into Unet2D, Unet2.5D, Unet3D, ResSEUnet3D, ResSEUnet2.5D, and TransResUnet2.5D, and their respective segmentation performances were compared and assessed. Results The segmentation results of the test set showed that TransResSEUnet2.5D performed the best in the DSC (84.08 ± 0.04) %, HD95 (8.11 ± 3.43) mm and time (6.50 ± 1.31) s metrics compared to the other three networks.

Methods A total of 233 lung adenocarcinoma patients were investigated and randomly divided into the training and test cohorts. In this study, 2300 radiomic features were extracted from original and filtered (Exponential, Laplacian of Gaussian, Logarithm, Gabor, Wavelet) CT images. The radiomic features were divided into four categories, including histogram, volumetric, morphologic, and texture features. An RF-BFE algorithm was developed to select the features for building the prediction models. Clinicopathological features (including age, gender, smoking status, TNM staging, maximum diameter, location, and growth pattern) were combined to establish an integrated model with radiomic features. ROC curve and AUC quantified the effectiveness of the predictor of EGFR mutation status and subtypes. Results A set of 10 features were selected to predict EGFR mutation status between EGFR mutant and wild type, while 9 selected features were used to predict mutation subtypes between exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation. To predict the EGFR mutation status, the AUC of the training cohort was 0.778 and the AUC of the test cohort was 0.765. To predict the EGFR mutation subtypes, the AUC of training cohort was 0.725 and the AUC of test cohort was 0.657. The integrated model showed the most optimal predictive performance with EGFR mutation status (AUC = 0.870 and 0.759) and subtypes (AUC = 0.797 and 0.554) in the training and test cohorts. Conclusion CT-based radiomic features can extract information on tumor heterogeneity in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we have established a radiomic model and an integrated model to non-invasively predict the EGFR mutation status and subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, which is conducive to saving clinical costs and guiding targeted therapy.",OncoTargets and Therapy,journal,a3c92136-86d8-407a-9c91-45bd53eb2c77,OncoTargets and therapy,597 - 608,15,,2022,2022-05-01 00:00:00,"Quan Chen, Yan Li, Qiguang Cheng, Juno S.

The surgical strategy of lymph node dissection is controversial because many more patients are diagnosed at an early stage in clinical practice. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 622 clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma patients with 3 cm or less in tumor size who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy combined with lymph node dissection in our hospital from January 2017 to December 2019. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify preoperative risk factors of lymph node metastasis. Results Lymph node metastasis was found in 60 out of 622 patients. On univariate analysis, lymph node metastasis was linked to smoking history, preoperative CEA level, tumor size, tumor location (peripheral or central), consolidation/tumor ratio, pleural invasion, and pathologic type. However, only the preoperative CEA level, tumor size, and consolidation/tumor ratio were independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. The ROC curve showed that the cutoff value of tumor size was 1.7 cm. There was no lymph node metastasis in patients without risk factors. Conclusions The preoperative CEA level, tumor size, and consolidation/tumor ratio were independent risk factors of lymph node metastasis in clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma with tumor size ≤ 3 cm. The lymph node metastasis rate was extremely low in clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma patients without risk factors and lymph node dissection should be avoided in these patients to reduce surgical trauma.",BMC Surgery,journal,bc44c99c-57c5-4494-9139-7bc84ae182bf,BMC Surgery,,22,,2022,2022-04-29 00:00:00,"C.

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases. Single-cell data are readily integrated with cell atlases using scArches.",Nature Biotechnology,journal,458166b3-de17-4bf3-bbbb-e53782de2f0f,Nature Biotechnology,121 - 130,40,,2021,2021-08-30 00:00:00,"M.

In the training cohort (N = 185), malignancy-related features, such as SUVmax, short-axis diameter (SAD), and CT radiomics features, were extracted from the regions of LN based on the PET/CT scan. The Minimum-Redundancy Maximum-Relevance (mRMR) algorithm and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model were used for feature selection and radiomics score building. The radiomics score (Rad-Score) and SUVmax were incorporated in a PET/CT nomogram using the multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated with discrimination, calibration, and clinical application in an independent testing cohort (N = 78). The radiomics scores consisting of 14 selected features were significantly associated with LN status for both training cohort with AUC of 0.849 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.796–0.903) and testing cohort with AUC of 0.828 (95% CI, 0.782–0.919). The PET/CT nomogram incorporating radiomics score and SUVmax showed moderate improvement of the efficiency with AUC of 0.881 (95% CI, 0.834–0.928) in the training cohort and AUC of 0.872 (95% CI, 0.797–0.946) in the testing cohort. The decision curve analysis indicated that the PET/CT nomogram was clinically useful. The PET/CT nomogram, which incorporates Rad-Score and SUVmax, can improve the diagnostic performance of LN metastasis. • The PET/CT nomogram (Int-Score) based on lymph node (LN) PET/CT images can reliably predict LN status in NSCLC. • Int-Score is a relatively objective diagnostic method, which can play an auxiliary role in the process of clinicians making treatment decisions.",European Radiology,journal,47f41409-58e8-4cf2-b8cb-2470d27e901a,European Radiology,6030 - 6038,31,,2021,2021-02-09 00:00:00,"Yunming Xie, Hongguang Zhao, Yan Guo, Fanyang Meng, Xiangchun Liu, Yiying Zhang, Xiaochen Huai, Qianting Wong, Yu Fu, Huimao Zhang","1410065415, 2146230810, 1563102326, 1484123869, 49543377, 1591119167, 114081113, 2048044455, 2118638103, 102551870",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a381197684b03657b91021da22a99eccf82b40d9,Medicine,1410065415,['JournalArticle'],28.0,41.0

This cross-sectional study used QGIS and GeoDa to explore the spatial pattern and heterogeneity of CRDs morbidity and spatial autocorrelation between socio-demographic factors and CRDs in Thailand from 2016 to 2019. We found an annual, positive, spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I >0.66, p<0.001) showing a strong clustered distribution. The local indicators of spatial association (LISA) identified hotspots mostly in the northern region, while coldspots were mostly seen in the central and north-eastern regions throughout the study period. Of the socio-demographic factors, the density of population, households, vehicles, factories and agricultural areas, correlated with the CRD morbidity rate, with statistically significant negative spatial autocorrelations and coldspots in the north-eastern and central areas (except for agricultural land) and two hotspots between farm household density and CRD in the southern region in 2019.

In this paper, we extend deviance measures to mixtures of GLMs, whose parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) via the EM algorithm. Such measures are defined both locally, i.e., at cluster-level, and globally, i.e., with reference to the whole sample. At the cluster-level, we propose a normalized two-term decomposition of the local deviance into explained, and unexplained local deviances. At the sample-level, we introduce an additive normalized decomposition of the total deviance into three terms, where each evaluates a different aspect of the fitted model: (1) the cluster separation on the dependent variable, (2) the proportion of the total deviance explained by the fitted model, and (3) the proportion of the total deviance which remains unexplained. We use both local and global decompositions to define, respectively, local and overall deviance R ^2 measures for mixtures of GLMs, which we illustrate—for Gaussian, Poisson and binomial responses—by means of a simulation study. The proposed fit measures are then used to assess, and interpret clusters of COVID-19 spread in Italy in two time points.",Journal of Classification,journal,1a82d65a-d5fa-4f7a-a059-8a65e4c446be,Journal of Classification,1 - 34,,,2023,2023-04-04 00:00:00,"Roberto Di Mari, S.

Therefore, the ability to correctly and quickly predict the effect of amino acid mutations is crucial for understanding disease effects and to be able to carry out genome-wide studies. Here, we report a new development of the SAAMBE method, SAAMBE-3D, which is a machine learning-based approach, resulting in accurate predictions and is extremely fast. It achieves the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 0.82 depending on the training protocol in benchmarking five-fold validation test against the SKEMPI v2.0 database and outperforms currently existing algorithms on various blind-tests. Furthermore, optimized and tested via five-fold cross-validation on the Cornell University dataset, the SAAMBE-3D achieves AUC of 1.0 and 0.96 on a homo and hereto-dimer test datasets. Another important feature of SAAMBE-3D is that it is very fast, it takes less than a fraction of a second to complete a prediction. SAAMBE-3D is available as a web server and as well as a stand-alone code, the last one being another important feature allowing other researchers to directly download the code and run it on their local computer. Combined all together, SAAMBE-3D is an accurate and fast software applicable for genome-wide studies to assess the effect of amino acid mutations on protein–protein interactions. The webserver and the stand-alone codes (SAAMBE-3D for predicting the change of binding free energy and SAAMBE-3D-DN for predicting if the mutation is disruptive or non-disruptive) are available.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,21,,2020,2020-04-01 00:00:00,"S.

To this end, several methods have been developed to predict changes in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding (∆∆G) between wild type and variant proteins, using sequence and structure information. Most of the available methods however do not exhibit the anti-symmetric prediction property, which guarantees that the predicted ∆∆G value for a variation is the exact opposite of that predicted for the reverse variation, i.e., ∆∆G(A → B) = −∆∆G(B → A), where A and B are amino acids. Here we introduce simple anti-symmetric features, based on evolutionary information, which are combined to define an untrained method, DDGun (DDG untrained). DDGun is a simple approach based on evolutionary information that predicts the ∆∆G for single and multiple variations from sequence and structure information (DDGun3D). Our method achieves remarkable performance without any training on the experimental datasets, reaching Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and measured ∆∆G values of ~ 0.5 and ~ 0.4 for single and multiple site variations, respectively. Surprisingly, DDGun performances are comparable with those of state of the art methods. DDGun also naturally predicts multiple site variations, thereby defining a benchmark method for both single site and multiple site predictors. DDGun is anti-symmetric by construction predicting the value of the ∆∆G of a reciprocal variation as almost equal (depending on the sequence profile) to -∆∆G of the direct variation. This is a valuable property that is missing in the majority of the methods. Evolutionary information alone combined in an untrained method can achieve remarkably high performances in the prediction of ∆∆G upon protein mutation. Non-trained approaches like DDGun represent a valid benchmark both for scoring the predictive power of the individual features and for assessing the learning capability of supervised methods.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,,20,,2019,2019-07-01 00:00:00,"Ludovica Montanucci, E.

Experimental evidence associates amino acid substitutions of the FXN to Friedreich Ataxia, a neurodegenerative disorder. Recently, new thermodynamic experiments have been performed to study the impact of somatic variations identified in cancer tissues on protein stability. The Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) data provider at the University of Rome measured the unfolding free energy of a set of variants (FXN challenge data set) with far‐UV circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectra. These values have been used to calculate the change in unfolding free energy between the variant and wild‐type proteins at zero concentration of denaturant (ΔΔGH2O) . The FXN challenge data set, composed of eight amino acid substitutions, was used to evaluate the performance of the current computational methods for predicting the ΔΔGH2O value associated with the variants and to classify them as destabilizing and not destabilizing. For the fifth edition of CAGI, six independent research groups from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America submitted 12 sets of predictions from different approaches. In this paper, we report the results of our assessment and discuss the limitations of the tested algorithms.",Human Mutation,journal,b51ebc17-99ea-48ba-9271-1074f526a9a1,Human Mutation,1392 - 1399,40,,2019,2019-06-17 00:00:00,"Castrense Savojardo, M.

Despite the significant benefits of this technique, it needs a considerable amount of time and energy to measure the Received Signal Strength (RSS) at Reference Points (RPs) and build a fingerprinting database to achieve an appropriate localization accuracy. Reducing the number of RPs can reduce this cost, but it noticeably degrades the accuracy of positioning. In order to alleviate this problem, this paper takes the interior architecture of the indoor area and signal propagation effects into account and proposes two novel recovery methods for creating the reconstructed database instead of the measured one. They only need a few numbers of RPs to reconstruct the database and even are able to produce a denser database. The first method is a new zone-based path-loss propagation model which employs fingerprints of different zones separately and the second one is a new interpolation method, zone-based Weighted Ring-based (WRB). The proposed methods are compared with the conventional path-loss model and six interpolation functions. Two different test environments along with a benchmarking testbed, and various RPs configurations are also utilized to verify the proposed recovery methods, based on the reconstruction errors and the localization accuracies they provide. The results indicate that by taking only 11% of the initial RPs, the new zone-based path-loss model decreases the localization error up to 26% compared to the conventional path-loss model and the proposed zone-based WRB method outperforms all the other interpolation methods and improves the accuracy by 40%.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,104462-104477,7,,2019,2019-07-30 00:00:00,"Vahideh Moghtadaiee, S.

Previous work indicated that these reads are characterized by erroneous split-read support that is interpreted as evidence of structural variants. Thus, a large number of false-positive structural variants are detected. To our knowledge, no tool is currently available to specifically call or filter structural variants in FFPE samples. To overcome this gap, we developed 2 R packages: SimFFPE and FilterFFPE. Results SimFFPE is a read simulator, specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data from FFPE samples. A mixture of characteristic artifact chimeric reads, as well as normal reads, is generated. FilterFFPE is a filtration algorithm, removing artifact chimeric reads from sequencing data while keeping real chimeric reads. To evaluate the performance of FilterFFPE, we performed structural variant calling with 3 common tools (Delly, Lumpy, and Manta) with and without prior filtration with FilterFFPE. After applying FilterFFPE, the mean positive predictive value improved from 0.27 to 0.48 in simulated samples and from 0.11 to 0.27 in real samples, while sensitivity remained basically unchanged or even slightly increased. Conclusions FilterFFPE improves the performance of SV calling in FFPE samples.

Nowadays, targeted therapies are based primarily on the detection of mutations, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) plays an important role in relevant clinical research. The mutation frequency is a major problem in tumor mutation detection and increasing sequencing depth is a widely used method to improve mutation calling performance. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of different sequencing depth and mutation frequency as well as mutation calling tools. In this study, Strelka2 and Mutect2 tools were used in detecting the performance of 30 combinations of sequencing depth and mutation frequency. Results showed that the precision rate kept greater than 95% in most of the samples. Generally, for higher mutation frequency (≥20%), sequencing depth ≥200X is sufficient for calling 95% mutations; for lower mutation frequency (≤10%), we recommend improving experimental method rather than increasing sequencing depth. Besides, according to our results, although Strelka2 and Mutect2 performed similarly, the former performed slightly better than the latter one at higher mutation frequency (≥20%), while Mutect2 performed better when the mutation frequency was lower than 10%. Besides, Strelka2 was 17 to 22 times faster than Mutect2 on average.

Many hospitals, however, collect and store Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Consequently, the sample size of whole genome cancer cohort studies could be increased tremendously by including FFPE samples, although the presence of artefacts might obfuscate the variant calling. To assess whether FFPE material can be used for cohort studies, we performed an in-depth comparison of somatic SNVs called on matching FF and FFPE Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) samples extracted from the same tumor. Four variant callers (i.e. Strelka2, Mutect2, VarScan2 and Shimmer) were used to call somatic variants on matching FF and FFPE WGS samples from a metastatic prostate tumor. Using the variants identified by these callers, we developed a heuristic to maximize the overlap between the FF and its FFPE counterpart in terms of sensitivity and precision. The proposed variant calling approach was then validated on nine matched primary samples. Finally, we assessed what fraction of the discrepancy could be attributed to intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), by comparing the overlap in clonal and subclonal somatic variants. We first compared variants between an FF and an FFPE sample from a metastatic prostate tumor, showing that on average 50% of the calls in the FF are recovered in the FFPE sample, with notable differences between callers. Combining the variants of the different callers using a simple heuristic, increases both the precision and the sensitivity of the variant calling. Validating the heuristic on nine additional matched FF-FFPE samples, resulted in an average F1-score of 0.58 and an outperformance of any of the individual callers. In addition, we could show that part of the discrepancy between the FF and the FFPE samples can be attributed to ITH. This study illustrates that when using the correct variant calling strategy, the majority of clonal SNVs can be recovered in an FFPE sample with high precision and sensitivity. These results suggest that somatic variants derived from WGS of FFPE material can be used in cohort studies.",BMC Medical Genomics,journal,e81d1e0a-38f9-4519-8a43-f5eb2a934efc,BMC Medical Genomics,,13,,2020,2020-01-16 00:00:00,"Louise de Schaetzen van Brienen, M.

However, standard variant calling approaches require a matched normal sample from the same individual, which is often not available in the retrospective setting, making it difficult to distinguish between true somatic variants and individual-specific germline variants. Archival sections often contain adjacent normal tissue, but this tissue can include infiltrating tumor cells. As existing comparative somatic variant callers are designed to exclude variants present in the normal sample, a novel approach is required to leverage adjacent normal tissue with infiltrating tumor cells for somatic variant calling. Here we present lumosVar 2.0, a software package designed to jointly analyze multiple samples from the same patient, built upon our previous single sample tumor only variant caller lumosVar 1.0. The approach assumes that the allelic fraction of somatic variants and germline variants follow different patterns as tumor content and copy number state change. lumosVar 2.0 estimates allele specific copy number and tumor sample fractions from the data, and uses a to model to determine expected allelic fractions for somatic and germline variants and to classify variants accordingly. To evaluate the utility of lumosVar 2.0 to jointly call somatic variants with tumor and adjacent normal samples, we used a glioblastoma dataset with matched high and low tumor content and germline whole exome sequencing data (for true somatic variants) available for each patient. Both sensitivity and positive predictive value were improved when analyzing the high tumor and low tumor samples jointly compared to analyzing the samples individually or in-silico pooling of the two samples. Finally, we applied this approach to a set of breast and prostate archival tumor samples for which tumor blocks containing adjacent normal tissue were available for sequencing. Joint analysis using lumosVar 2.0 detected several variants, including known cancer hotspot mutations that were not detected by standard somatic variant calling tools using the adjacent tissue as presumed normal reference. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of leveraging paired tissue samples to improve somatic variant calling when a constitutional sample is not available.",Frontiers in Oncology,journal,fdeb07d1-a046-4a1a-98aa-167e7f8e667a,Frontiers in Oncology,,9,,2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,"Rebecca F.

One important consideration in repurposing FFPE material for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis is the sequencing artifacts that can arise from the significant damage to nucleic acids due to treatment with formalin, storage at room temperature and extraction. One such class of artifacts consists of chimeric reads that appear to be derived from non-contiguous portions of the genome. Here, we show that a major proportion of such chimeric reads align to both the ‘Watson’ and ‘Crick’ strands of the reference genome. We refer to these as strand-split artifact reads (SSARs). This study provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic basis of the genesis of SSARs and other chimeric artifacts along with supporting experimental evidence, which have led to approaches to reduce the levels of such artifacts. We demonstrate that one of these approaches, involving S1 nuclease-mediated removal of single-stranded fragments and overhangs, also reduces sequence bias, base error rates, and false positive detection of copy number and single nucleotide variants. Finally, we describe an analytical approach for quantifying SSARs from NGS data.",Nucleic Acids Research,journal,da96c220-cd39-4894-bae6-d2d77c8e7aa9,Nucleic Acids Research,e12 - e12,47,,2018,2018-11-12 00:00:00,"S.

These genes have the greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have diverse molecular functions that include the formation, structure, and function of the synapse. The associations of NMDA receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for the dysfunction of the glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We find significant evidence for an overlap of rare variant risk between schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and severe neurodevelopmental disorders (DD/ID), supporting a neurodevelopmental etiology for schizophrenia. We show that protein-truncating variants in GRIN2A, TRIO, and CACNA1G confer risk for schizophrenia whereas specific missense mutations in these genes confer risk for DD/ID. Nevertheless, few of the strongly associated schizophrenia genes appear to confer risk for DD/ID. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare variant risk, suggesting that common and rare genetic risk factors at least partially converge on the same underlying pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry a substantial excess of URVs, implying that more schizophrenia risk genes await discovery using this approach.",medRxiv,journal,d5e5b5e7-54b1-4f53-82fc-4853f3e71c58,medRxiv,,,,2020,2020-09-18 00:00:00,"T.

In this study, we conducted a TWAS using gene expression data from GTEx and summary statistics from the hitherto largest GWAS meta-analysis conducted for breast cancer overall, and by estrogen receptor subtypes (ER+ and ER−). We further compared associations with ER+ and ER− subtypes, using a case-only TWAS approach. We also conducted multigene conditional analyses in regions with multiple TWAS associations. Two genes, STXBP4 and HIST2H2BA, were specifically associated with ER+ but not with ER− breast cancer. We further identified 30 TWAS-significant genes associated with overall breast cancer risk, including four that were not identified in previous studies. Conditional analyses identified single independent breast-cancer gene in three of six regions harboring multiple TWAS-significant genes. Our study provides new information on breast cancer genetics and biology, particularly about genomic differences between ER+ and ER− breast cancer.",Genetic Epidemiology,journal,0bebd3b7-9bc2-4d76-9916-59f72f7a4d30,Genetic epidemiology,442 - 468,44,,2020,2020-03-01 00:00:00,"Helian Feng, Alexander Gusev, B.

The current availability of hundreds of GWASs provides a unique opportunity to address these questions. We systematically analyzed 4,155 publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWASs on 558 traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and genetic architecture. We show that trait-associated loci cover more than half of the genome, and 90% of these overlap with loci from multiple traits. We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits. Our results provide insights into how genetic variation contributes to trait variation. All GWAS results can be queried and visualized at the GWAS ATLAS resource (https://atlas.ctglab.nl).

Habitat mapping relies on seafloor classification typically based on acoustic methods, and ground truthing through direct sampling and optical imaging. With the increasing capabilities to record high-resolution underwater images, manual approaches for analyzing these images to create seafloor classifications are no longer feasible. Automated workflows have been proposed as a solution, in which algorithms assign pre-defined seafloor categories to each image. However, in order to provide consistent and repeatable analysis, these automated workflows need to address e.g., underwater illumination artefacts, variances in resolution and class-imbalances, which could bias the classification. Here, we present a generic implementation of an Automated and Integrated Seafloor Classification Workflow (AI-SCW). The workflow aims to classify the seafloor into habitat categories based on automated analysis of optical underwater images with only minimal amount of human annotations. AI-SCW incorporates laser point detection for scale determination and color normalization. It further includes semi-automatic generation of the training data set for fitting the seafloor classifier. As a case study, we applied the workflow to an example seafloor image dataset from the Belgian and German contract areas for Manganese-nodule exploration in the Pacific Ocean. Based on this, we provide seafloor classifications along the camera deployment tracks, and discuss results in the context of seafloor multibeam bathymetry. Our results show that the seafloor in the Belgian area predominantly comprises densely distributed nodules, which are intermingled with qualitatively larger-sized nodules at local elevations and within depressions. On the other hand, the German area primarily comprises nodules that only partly cover the seabed, and these occur alongside turned-over sediment (artificial seafloor) that were caused by the settling plume following a dredging experiment conducted in the area.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,,2022,2022-09-12 00:00:00,"Benson Mbani, T.

Technological advances like 4K cameras, autonomous robots, high-capacity batteries and LED lighting now allow systematic optical monitoring at large spatial scale and shorter time but with increased data volume and velocity. Volume and velocity are further increased by growing fleets and emerging swarms of autonomous vehicles creating big data sets in parallel. This generates a need for automated data processing to harvest maximum information. Systematic data analysis benefits from calibrated, geo-referenced data with clear metadata description, particularly for machine vision and machine learning. Hence, the expensive data acquisition must be documented, data should be curated as soon as possible, backed up and made publicly available.

In this study, high-resolution bathymetric multibeam and optical image data,
both obtained within the Belgian manganese (Mn) nodule mining license area by
the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Abyss, were combined in
order to create a predictive random
forests (RF) machine learning model. AUV bathymetry reveals small-scale
terrain variations, allowing slope estimations and calculation of bathymetric
derivatives such as slope, curvature, and ruggedness. Optical AUV imagery
provides quantitative information regarding the distribution (number and
median size) of Mn nodules. Within the area considered in this study, Mn
nodules show a heterogeneous and spatially clustered pattern, and their
number per square meter is negatively correlated with their median size. A
prediction of the number of Mn nodules was achieved by combining information
derived from the acoustic and optical data using a RF model. This model was
tuned by examining the influence of the training set size, the number of
growing trees (ntree), and the number of predictor variables to be
randomly selected at each node (mtry) on the RF prediction accuracy. The use of larger training
data sets with higher ntree and mtry values increases the
accuracy. To estimate the Mn-nodule abundance, these predictions were linked
to ground-truth data acquired by box coring. Linking optical and
hydroacoustic data revealed a nonlinear relationship between the Mn-nodule
distribution and topographic characteristics. This highlights the importance
of a detailed terrain reconstruction for a predictive modeling of Mn-nodule
abundance. In addition, this study underlines the necessity of a sufficient
spatial distribution of the optical data to provide reliable modeling input
for the RF.

Nevertheless, the complexity and non-linear behaviour associated with such kind of energy systems hinder the development of accurate algorithms. In such a context, this paper investigates the use of a state-of-art deep learning architecture in order to perform precise load demand forecasting 24-h-ahead in the whole country of France using RTE data. To this end, the authors propose an encoder-decoder architecture inspired by WaveNet, a deep generative model initially designed by Google DeepMind for raw audio waveforms. WaveNet uses dilated causal convolutions and skip-connection to utilise long-term information. This kind of novel ML architecture presents different advantages regarding other statistical algorithms. On the one hand, the proposed deep learning model’s training process can be parallelized in GPUs, which is an advantage in terms of training times compared to recurrent networks. On the other hand, the model prevents degradations problems (explosions and vanishing gradients) due to the residual connections. In addition, this model can learn from an input sequence to produce a forecast sequence in a one-shot manner.

An accurate prediction of power load can provide a reliable decision for power system management. To solve the limitation of the existing load forecasting methods in dealing with time-series data, causing the poor stability and non-ideal forecasting accuracy, this paper proposed an attention-based encoder-decoder network with Bayesian optimization to do the accurate short-term power load forecasting. Proposed model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with a gated recurrent units (GRU) recurrent neural network with high robustness on time-series data modeling. The temporal attention layer focuses on the key features of input data that play a vital role in promoting the prediction accuracy for load forecasting. Finally, the Bayesian optimization method is used to confirm the model’s hyperparameters to achieve optimal predictions. The verification experiments of 24 h load forecasting with real power load data from American Electric Power (AEP) show that the proposed model outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy and algorithm stability, providing an effective approach for migrating time-serial power load prediction by deep-learning technology.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,,2021,2021-03-13 00:00:00,"Xue-bo Jin, Weiguang Zheng, Jianlei Kong, Xiaoyi Wang, Yuting Bai, Tingli Su, Seng Lin","40430910, 2152973806, 26434105, 50141969, 3768636, 2847804, 2115208297",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca47d9ba0902cdd27ac7b54ed7c94b605da3ecf5,"Computer Science, Engineering",40430910,,119.0,63.0

Moreover, a push for electrical vehicle and other economic developments are expected to further increase energy use. To combat these challenges, electrical load forecasting is essential as it supports energy production planning and scheduling, assists with budgeting, and helps identify saving opportunities. Machine learning approaches commonly used for energy forecasting such as feedforward neural networks and support vector regression encounter challenges with capturing time dependencies. Consequently, this paper proposes Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Network (S2S RNN) with Attention for electrical load forecasting. The S2S architecture from language translation is adapted for load forecasting and a corresponding sample generation approach is designed. RNN enables capturing time dependencies present in the load data and S2S model further improves time modeling by combining two RNNs: encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism alleviates the burden of connecting encoder and decoder. The experiments evaluated attention mechanisms with different RNN cells (vanilla, LSTM, and GRU) and with varied time horizons. Results show that S2S with Bahdanau attention outperforms other models. Accuracy decreases as forecasting horizon increases; however, longer input sequences do not always increase accuracy.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,36411-36426,8,,2020,2020-02-21 00:00:00,"Ljubisa Sehovac, Katarina Grolinger","1380993111, 2222599",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3c897df9bbdc2fd32f99e5d9fa2ffadff0820e8,"Computer Science, Engineering",1380993111,['JournalArticle'],132.0,39.0

Since high levels of uncertainties exist in the load time series, it is a challenging task to make accurate short-term load forecast (STLF). In recent years, deep learning approaches provide better performance to predict electrical load in real world cases. The convolutional neural network (CNN) can extract the local trend and capture the same pattern, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed to learn the relationship in time steps. In this paper, a new deep neural network framework that integrates the hidden feature of the CNN model and the LSTM model is proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy. The proposed model was tested in a real-world case, and detailed experiments were conducted to validate its practicality and stability. The forecasting performance of the proposed model was compared with the LSTM model and the CNN model. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used as the evaluation indexes.

The traditional physical education monitoring environment creates crucial manual efforts on athletes' activity observations and tracking consistently. Similarly, remote monitoring and assessment of athletes in sports training seem to be barriers to physical education monitoring and training. It creates various chances to improve training and education through technology advancements like IoT and deep learning. Students can efficiently monitor their physical behavior to increase their physical and psychological benefits.

The study explored the use of the random forest regression (RFR), a supervised machine learning (ML) model, as an alternative to the physically based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for predicting streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters near Del Norte, a snowmelt-dominated mountainous watershed of the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Remotely sensed data were used for the random forest machine learning analysis (RFML) and RStudio for data processing and synthesizing. The RFML model outperformed the SWAT model in accuracy and demonstrated its capability in predicting streamflow in this region. We implemented a customized approach to the RFR model to assess the model’s performance for three training periods, across 1991–2010, 1996–2010, and 2001–2010; the results indicated that the model’s accuracy improved with longer training periods, implying that the model trained on a more extended period is better able to capture the parameters’ variability and reproduce streamflow data more accurately. The variable importance (i.e., IncNodePurity) measure of the RFML model revealed that the snow depth and the minimum temperature were consistently the top two predictors across all training periods. The paper also evaluated how well the SWAT model performs in reproducing streamflow data of the watershed with a conventional approach. The SWAT model needed more time and data to set up and calibrate, delivering acceptable performance in annual mean streamflow simulation, with satisfactory index of agreement (d), coefficient of determination (R2), and percent bias (PBIAS) values, but monthly simulation warrants further exploration and model adjustments. The study recommends exploring snowmelt runoff hydrologic processes, dust-driven sublimation effects, and more detailed topographic input parameters to update the SWAT snowmelt routine for better monthly flow estimation. The results provide a critical analysis for enhancing streamflow prediction, which is valuable for further research and water resource management, including snowmelt-driven semi-arid regions.",Remote Sensing,journal,8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

In this paper, a multi-scale-variables-driven streamflow forecasting (MVDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy and provide more information for decision-making. This framework was realized by integrating random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with multi-scale variables (hydrometeorological and climate predictors) as inputs and is referred to as RF-GPR-MV. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the RF-GPR-MV model, it was implemented for multi-step-ahead monthly streamflow forecasts with horizons of 1 to 12 months for two key hydrological stations in the Jinsha River basin, Southwest China. Other MVDSF models based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and GPR with/without multi-scale variables or the PCC and a backpropagation neural network (BP) or general regression neural network (GRNN), with only previous streamflow and precipitation, namely, PCC-GPR-MV, PCC-GPR-QP, PCC-BP-QP, and PCC-GRNN-QP, respectively, were selected as benchmarks. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model was superior to the other benchmark models in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for almost all forecasting scenarios, especially for forecasting with longer lead times. Additionally, the results also confirmed that the addition of large-scale climate and circulation factors was beneficial for promoting the streamflow forecasting ability, with an average contribution rate of about 15%. The RF in the MVDSF framework improved the forecasting performance, with an average contribution rate of about 25%. This improvement was more pronounced when the lead time exceeded 3 months. Moreover, the proposed model could also provide prediction intervals (PIs) to characterize forecast uncertainty, as supplementary information to further help decision makers in relevant departments to avoid risks in water resources management.",Water,journal,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,,2022,2022-06-06 00:00:00,"Na Sun, Shuai Zhang, Tian Peng, N.

In the present study, machine learning (ML) models based on the support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are tested and developed to predict SF for 11 different rivers throughout Peninsular Malaysia. SF data sets for the rivers were collected from the Malaysian Department of Irrigation and Drainage. The main objective of the present study is to propose a universal model that is most capable of predicting SFs for rivers within Peninsular Malaysia.

Herein OCE was applied to evaluate previously inaccessible biomechanical characteristics of human corneal tissue and to study the role of Bowman's layer in corneal biomechanics. Methods Human corneal donor buttons (n = 23) were obtained and Descemet's membrane and endothelium were removed. In 11 corneas, Bowman's layer was ablated by a 20 µm stromal excimer laser ablation. Buttons were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber and subjected to a pressure modulation from 10 to 30 mm Hg, and back to 10 mm Hg, in steps of 1 mm Hg. At each step, a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scan was obtained. Displacements were analyzed by optical flow tracking, and strain over the entire stromal depth was retrieved from the phase gradient of the complex interference signal. Results During pressure increase, corneal tissue moved upward (486–585 nm/mm Hg) but did not fully recover (Δ= 2.63 to 8.64 µm) after pressure decrease. Vertical corneal strain distribution was negative in the anterior and positive in the posterior cornea, indicating simultaneous corneal compression and expansion, respectively. Bowman's layer caused minor localized differences in corneal strain distribution. Conclusions Corneal strain distribution is more complex than previously assumed, with a fundamental difference in mechanical response between the anterior and posterior stroma.

Risk prediction of hypertension is an intervention that contributes to the early prevention and management of hypertension. The implementation of such intervention requires an effective and easy-to-implement hypertension risk prediction model. This study evaluated and compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms on predicting the risk of hypertension based on easy-to-collect risk factors. A dataset of 29,700 samples collected through a physical examination was used for model training and testing. Firstly, we identified easy-to-collect risk factors of hypertension, through univariate logistic regression analysis. Then, based on the selected features, 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to optimize four models, random forest (RF), CatBoost, MLP neural network and logistic regression (LR), to find the best hyper-parameters on the training set. Finally, the performance of models was evaluated by AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on the test set. The experimental results showed that the RF model outperformed the other three models, and achieved an AUC of 0.92, an accuracy of 0.82, a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.81. In addition, Body Mass Index (BMI), age, family history and waist circumference (WC) are the four primary risk factors of hypertension. These findings reveal that it is feasible to use machine learning algorithms, especially RF, to predict hypertension risk without clinical or genetic data. The technique can provide a non-invasive and economical way for the prevention and management of hypertension in a large population.",Frontiers in Public Health,journal,d3dd5449-daa1-4d57-9412-9add6037584f,Frontiers in Public Health,,9,,2021,2021-09-24 00:00:00,"Huanhuan Zhao, Xiaoyu Zhang, Yang Xu, Lisheng Gao, Zuchang Ma, Yining Sun, Weimin Wang","47940978, 2115797509, 2115681606, 1804676886, 2915371, 2548973, 2144318755",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e24c87ea6ebb4a8ff106e1e173708f2f807398c1,"Computer Science, Medicine",47940978,['JournalArticle'],32.0,56.0

Prediction and early diagnosis is important to prevent related health complications. The objective is to construct and compare predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using 987 records of Qataris and long-term residents aged 18+ years from Qatar Biobank. Percentages were used to summarize data and chi-square tests to assess associations. Predictive models of hypertension were constructed and compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of algorithms was assessed using accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Stata and Weka were used for analysis. Results Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother’s history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. All algorithms showed more or less similar performances: Random forest (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.4%, sensitivity = 82.1%), logistic regression (accuracy = 81.1%, PPV = 80.1%, sensitivity = 81.1%) and decision tree (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.2%, sensitivity = 82.1%. In terms of AUC, compared to logistic regression, while random forest performed similarly, decision tree had a significantly lower discrimination ability (p-value<0.05) with AUC’s equal to 85.0, 86.9, and 79.9, respectively. Conclusions Machine learning provides the chance of having a rapid predictive model using non-invasive predictors to screen for hypertension. Future research should consider improving the predictive accuracy of models in larger general populations, including more important predictors and using a variety of algorithms.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,15,,2020,2020-10-16 00:00:00,"Latifa A AlKaabi, Lina S Ahmed, Maryam F Al Attiyah, M.

Chapter 12 concludes the book with some commentary about the scienti c contributions of MTS. The Taguchi method for design of experiment has generated considerable controversy in the statistical community over the past few decades. The MTS/MTGS method seems to lead another source of discussions on the methodology it advocates (Montgomery 2003). As pointed out by Woodall et al. (2003), the MTS/MTGS methods are considered ad hoc in the sense that they have not been developed using any underlying statistical theory. Because the “normal” and “abnormal” groups form the basis of the theory, some sampling restrictions are fundamental to the applications. First, it is essential that the “normal” sample be uniform, unbiased, and/or complete so that a reliable measurement scale is obtained. Second, the selection of “abnormal” samples is crucial to the success of dimensionality reduction when OAs are used. For example, if each abnormal item is really unique in the medical example, then it is unclear how the statistical distance MD can be guaranteed to give a consistent diagnosis measure of severity on a continuous scale when the larger-the-better type S/N ratio is used. Multivariate diagnosis is not new to Technometrics readers and is now becoming increasingly more popular in statistical analysis and data mining for knowledge discovery. As a promising alternative that assumes no underlying data model, The Mahalanobis–Taguchi Strategy does not provide suf cient evidence of gains achieved by using the proposed method over existing tools. Readers may be very interested in a detailed comparison with other diagnostic tools, such as logistic regression and tree-based methods. Overall, although the idea of MTS/MTGS is intriguing, this book would be more valuable had it been written in a rigorous fashion as a technical reference. There is some lack of precision even in several mathematical notations. Perhaps a follow-up with additional theoretical justi cation and careful case studies would answer some of the lingering questions.",Technometrics,journal,ca4b3aef-bda7-47fe-b7e5-4f9cd6cb1947,Technometrics,267 - 268,45,,2003,2003-08-01 00:00:00,E.

Here, we report assessments of RNA structure predictions in CASP15, the first CASP exercise that involved RNA structure modeling. Forty two predictor groups submitted models for at least one of twelve RNA-containing targets. These models were evaluated by the RNA-Puzzles organizers and, separately, by a CASP-recruited team using metrics (GDT, lDDT) and approaches (Z-score rankings) initially developed for assessment of proteins and generalized here for RNA assessment. The two assessments independently ranked the same predictor groups as first (AIchemy_RNA2), second (Chen), and third (RNAPolis and GeneSilico, tied); predictions from deep learning approaches were significantly worse than these top ranked groups, which did not use deep learning. Further analyses based on direct comparison of predicted models to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps and X-ray diffraction data support these rankings. With the exception of two RNA-protein complexes, models submitted by CASP15 groups correctly predicted the global fold of the RNA targets. Comparisons of CASP15 submissions to designed RNA nanostructures as well as molecular replacement trials highlight the potential utility of current RNA modeling approaches for RNA nanotechnology and structural biology, respectively.

However, accurate modeling of 3D RNA structure remains a challenging problem. Here we present a novel method, DRfold, to predict RNA tertiary structures by simultaneous learning of local frame rotations and geometric restraints from experimentally solved RNA structures, where the learned knowledge is converted into a hybrid energy potential to guide subsequent RNA structure constructions. The method significantly outperforms previous approaches by >75.6% in TM-score on a nonredundant dataset containing recently released structures. Detailed analyses showed that the major contribution to the improvements arise from the deep end-to-end learning supervised with the atom coordinates and the composite energy function integrating complementary information from geometry restraints and end-to-end learning models.

Inspired by the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction, we developed trRosettaRNA, a novel deep learning-based approach to de novo prediction of RNA 3D structure. Like trRosetta, the trRosettaRNA pipeline comprises two major steps: 1D and 2D geometries prediction by a transformer network; and full-atom 3D structure folding by energy minimization with constraints from the predicted geometries. We benchmarked trRosettaRNA on two independent datasets. The results show that trRosettaRNA outperforms other conventional methods by a large margin. For example, on 25 targets from the RNA-Puzzles experiments, the mean RMSD of the models predicted by trRosettaRNA is 5.5 Å, compared with 10.5 Å from the state-of-the-art human group (i.e., Das). Further comparisons with two recently released deep learning-based methods (i.e., DeepFoldRNA and RoseTTAFoldNA) show that all three methods have similar accuracy. However, trRosettaRNA yields more accurate and physically more realistic side-chain atoms than DeepFoldRNA and RoseTTAFoldNA. Finally, we apply trRosettaRNA to predict the structures for the Rfam families that do not have known structures. Analysis shows that for 263 families, the predicted structure models are estimated to be accurate with RMSD < 4 Å. The trRosettaRNA server and the package are available at: https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/trRosettaRNA/.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,bioRxiv,,,,2022,2022-10-25 00:00:00,"Chen-Jie Feng, Wenkai Wang, Renmin Han, Ziyi Wang, Lisa Ye, Zongyang Du, Hong Wei, Fa Zhang, Zhenling Peng, Jianyi Yang","51132607, 2108531935, 3320694, 2186305602, 2189022877, 121372157, 2115312908, 2153197768, 2559811, 49500220",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74017e53e8a65d72523145eee96c8c98a9520814,"Biology, Computer Science",51132607,,12.0,40.0

TinyML is a rapidly growing subfield at the intersection of computer science, software engineering, and machine learning. Building deep learning (DL) networks that are a few hundred KBs in size has been the focus of recent research in this area. Deploying TinyML into small devices makes them smart. Reduced computation, power usage, and response time are just a few of the many advantages of TinyML. In this work, we provide an introduction to TinyML and demonstrate its benefits and architecture. Then, we investigate the meaning of quantization as a standard compression method for TinyML-related applications. There are two methods used to obtain the quantized weights of the deep learning models are quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ), we described them in details. Next, TinyML-based solutions to improve the role of IoT devices in Smart Cities are highlighted as: lightweight training of deep learning models, inference of lightweight deep learning models in IoT devices, low power consumption, and inference of deep learning models in restricted resources of IoT devices. Finally, presenting some use cases for TinyML studies, with these studies applied to several cases in a variety of fields.

This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes Explainable AI (XAI) to improve the interpretability of predictive healthcare models. The proposed system integrates feature importance-based methodologies with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to offer a comprehensive comprehension of the predictive and preventive healthcare recommendations. The framework commences by conducting an in-depth examination of the present condition of Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare sector, as well as the importance of predictive and preventive healthcare. The literature review examines the difficulties related to the comprehensibility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare field and presents feature importance-based approaches and LIME as potential remedies. The focus is on the hybrid approach that combines these techniques, as it has the potential to offer precise predictions while also ensuring a strong level of interpretability. The methodology section delineates the procedure for gathering healthcare data and IoT sensor data, subsequently followed by preprocessing measures such as data cleansing and feature engineering. The predictive models undergo a process of selection, training, and evaluation, with the primary objective of attaining a notable accuracy level of 0.961. This text provides a detailed explanation of how the combination of feature importance-based approaches and LIME improves the transparency and interpretability of the model. An extensive case study is provided to illustrate the implementation of the suggested framework in an actual situation. The results and evaluation section showcases the exceptional precision of 0.961, as well as enhanced interpretability scores and decreased computational time in comparison to the baseline XAI models. The discussion section juxtaposes the suggested hybrid approach with conventional models, examines ethical considerations, and investigates the scalability and generalizability of the framework. To conclude, the paper provides a concise overview of the findings and implications of the Explainable AI-Powered IoT Systems for Predictive and Preventive Healthcare framework. This hybrid approach demonstrates high accuracy, improved interpretability, and efficient computational performance, making it a promising advancement in personalized health management and wellness optimization. This research adds to the expanding collection of literature on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the healthcare sector, thus opening up possibilities for future research avenues and practical applications in this domain.",Journal of Electrical Systems,journal,6481b292-4036-4fc7-9b84-445d7ad954c3,Journal of Electrical Systems,,,,2024,2024-01-25 00:00:00,Et al.

Visual data in such cameras are usually captured in analog voltages by a sensor pixel array, and then converted to the digital domain for subsequent AI processing using analog-to-digital converters (ADC). Recent research has tried to take advantage of massively parallel low-power analog/digital computing in the form of near- and in-sensor processing, in which the AI computation is performed partly in the periphery of the pixel array and partly in a separate on-board CPU/accelerator. Unfortunately, high-resolution input images still need to be streamed between the camera and the AI processing unit, frame by frame, causing energy, bandwidth, and security bottlenecks. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel Processing-in-Pixel-in-memory (P2M) paradigm, that customizes the pixel array by adding support for analog multi-channel, multi-bit convolution, batch normalization, and Rectified Linear Units (ReLU). Our solution includes a holistic algorithm-circuit co-design approach and the resulting P2M paradigm can be used as a drop-in replacement for embedding memory-intensive first few layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) models within foundry-manufacturable CMOS image sensor platforms. Our experimental results indicate that P2M reduces data transfer bandwidth from sensors and analog to digital conversions by ∼21×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\sim }\,21\times$$\end{document}, and the energy-delay product (EDP) incurred in processing a MobileNetV2 model on a TinyML use case for visual wake words dataset (VWW) by up to ∼11×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathord {\sim }\,11\times$$\end{document} compared to standard near-processing or in-sensor implementations, without any significant drop in test accuracy.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,,2022,2022-03-07 00:00:00,"G.

To enhance the contrast ratio of the generated image, two additional regulation terms are introduced in the loss function of the underlying GAN. By applying an appropriate threshold to the segmentation of the generated image, the real crack areas and the fake crack areas (which are affected by the noises) are accurately distinguished. Experiments are carried out to show the superiority of the improved GAN over the original one on crack detection tasks, where a real-world NDT dataset is exploited that consists of magnetic optical images obtained using the electromagnetic NDT technique.",Complex & Intelligent Systems,journal,d30c9917-b233-46f4-a644-8e5cdf6d6c5e,Complex & Intelligent Systems,467 - 476,8,,2021,2021-07-29 00:00:00,"Lulu Tian, Zidong Wang, Weibo Liu, Yuhua Cheng, F.

Aiming at the difficulty in fault characteristics extraction and fault modes classification of the three-phase full-bridge inverter (TFI) that used as the drive module of brushless DC motor (BLDCM). A hybrid convolutional neural network (HCNN) model consists of one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) and two-dimensional CNN (2D-CNN) is proposed in this paper, which can tap more effective spatial feature for TFI fault diagnosis. The frequency spectrum from the three-phase current signal preprocess are applied as the input for 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN to conduct feature extraction, respectively. Then, the feature layers information are combined in the fully connected layer of HCNN. Finally, the performance status of TFI could be identified by the softmax classifier with Adam optimizer. Several groups of experiments have been studied when the BLDCM under different operating conditions. The results show that the fusion features can get a higher degree of discrimination so as to the presented network model also obtains better classification accuracy, which verify the feasibility and superiority to the other networks.",Complex & Intelligent Systems,journal,d30c9917-b233-46f4-a644-8e5cdf6d6c5e,Complex & Intelligent Systems,29 - 42,8,,2021,2021-04-03 00:00:00,"Quan Sun, Xianghai Yu, Hongsheng Li, JiSheng Fan","2109272295, 102908609, 2108509846, 2041290857",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d0bec7a00bb589f183ac306da39345d6f363e31,"Computer Science, Engineering",2109272295,,36.0,48.0

Objective The objective of this study was to develop a new method, based on an app for mobile phones called e-EPIDEMIOLOGY, which was designed to collect individual consumption data for a series of foods/drinks, and to compare this app with a previously validated paper food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Methods University students >18 years of age recorded the consumption of certain foods/drinks using e-EPIDEMIOLOGY during 28 consecutive days and then filled out a paper FFQ at the end of the study period. To evaluate the agreement between the categories of habitual consumption for each of the foods/drinks included in the study, cross-classification analysis and a weighted kappa statistic were used. Results A total of 119 participants completed the study (71% female, 85/119; 29% male, 34/119). Cross-classification analysis showed that 79.8% of the participants were correctly classified into the same category and just 1.1% were misclassified into opposite categories. The average weighted kappa statistic was good (κ=.64). Conclusions The results indicate that e-EPIDEMIOLOGY generated ranks of dietary intakes that were highly comparable with the previously validated paper FFQ. However, it was noted that further testing of e-EPIDEMIOLOGY is required to establish its wider utility.",JMIR Research Protocols,journal,278131df-030d-4e6c-b083-d57f3b740dc4,JMIR Research Protocols,,5,,2016,2016-11-02 00:00:00,"L.

If successful, these lifestyle apps may have far-reaching effects for disease prevention and health cost-savings, but few researchers have analyzed data from these apps. Objective The purposes of this study were to analyze data from a commercial health app (Lose It!) in order to identify successful weight loss subgroups via exploratory analyses and to verify the stability of the results. Methods Cross-sectional, de-identified data from Lose It! were analyzed. This dataset (n=12,427,196) was randomly split into 24 subsamples, and this study used 3 subsamples (combined n=972,687). Classification and regression tree methods were used to explore groupings of weight loss with one subsample, with descriptive analyses to examine other group characteristics. Data mining validation methods were conducted with 2 additional subsamples. Results In subsample 1, 14.96% of users lost 5% or more of their starting body weight. Classification and regression tree analysis identified 3 distinct subgroups: “the occasional users” had the lowest proportion (4.87%) of individuals who successfully lost weight; “the basic users” had 37.61% weight loss success; and “the power users” achieved the highest percentage of weight loss success at 72.70%. Behavioral factors delineated the subgroups, though app-related behavioral characteristics further distinguished them. Results were replicated in further analyses with separate subsamples. Conclusions This study demonstrates that distinct subgroups can be identified in “messy” commercial app data and the identified subgroups can be replicated in independent samples. Behavioral factors and use of custom app features characterized the subgroups. Targeting and tailoring information to particular subgroups could enhance weight loss success. Future studies should replicate data mining analyses to increase methodology rigor.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,journal,2baad992-2268-4c38-9120-e453622f2eeb,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,18,,2016,2016-06-01 00:00:00,"Katrina J Serrano, Mandi Yu, Kisha I Coa, L.

In clinical practice, this technology has greatly enabled the development of personalized medicine, approaching each patient individually and in accordance with their genetic and biochemical profile. The most propulsive areas include rare disease genomics, oncogenomics, pharmacogenomics, neonatal screening, and infectious disease genomics. Another crucial application of WGS lies in the field of multi-omics, working towards the complete integration of human biomolecular data. Further technological development of sequencing technologies has led to the birth of third and fourth-generation sequencing, which include long-read sequencing, single-cell genomics, and nanopore sequencing. These technologies, alongside their continued implementation into medical research and practice, show great promise for the future of the field of medicine.",Cells,journal,51278f27-cfdd-4938-81e4-9d54ca7b3cd0,Cells,,13,,2024,2024-03-01 00:00:00,"P.

Accumulating evidences have revealed the close relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation and progression of stomach cancer. However, rare prognostic models for mitochondrial-related gene risk have been built up in stomach cancer. Methods In current study, the expression and prognostic value of mitochondrial-related genes in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients were systematically analyzed to establish a mitochondrial-related risk model based on available TCGA and GEO databases. The tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell infiltration, tumor mutation burden, and drug sensitivity of gastric adenocarcinoma patients were also investigated using R language, GraphPad Prism 8 and online databases. Results We established a mitochondrial-related risk prognostic model including NOX4, ALDH3A2, FKBP10 and MAOA and validated its predictive power. This risk model indicated that the immune cell infiltration in high-risk group was significantly different from that in the low-risk group. Besides, the risk score was closely related to TME signature genes and immune checkpoint molecules, suggesting that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment might lead to poor prognosis in high-risk groups. Moreover, TIDE analysis demonstrated that combined analysis of risk score and immune score, or stromal score, or microsatellite status could more effectively predict the benefit of immunotherapy in STAD patients with different stratifications. Finally, rapamycin, PD-0325901 and dasatinib were found to be more effective for patients in the high-risk group, whereas AZD7762, CEP-701 and methotrexate were predicted to be more effective for patients in the low-risk group. Conclusions Our results suggest that the mitochondrial-related risk model could be a reliable prognostic biomarker for personalized treatment of STAD patients.",Journal of Translational Medicine,journal,2fd4c673-ebec-4ccf-b719-594b48795306,Journal of Translational Medicine,,21,,2023,2023-03-13 00:00:00,"Jingjia Chang, Hao Wu, Jin Wu, Ming Liu, Wentao Zhang, Yanfen Hu, Xin-Tao Zhang, Jing Xu, Li Li, Pengfei Yu, Jianjun Zhu","2211468948, 1664776313, 2315446317, 2112748066, 2108232527, 87694311, 5048402, 2212230799, 2156055855, 2936304, 6060842",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75b25b7a0bed155c34f906817c2cfeddab1d2f01,"Biology, Medicine",2211468948,['JournalArticle'],37.0,69.0

The pathophysiology was outlined by RNA-sequencing of mucosal biopsies from non-inflamed and inflamed colon of UC patients (14 and 17, respectively), and from 27 patients without intestinal inflammation. Genes differentially expressed (DE), or present in enriched gene sets, were investigated using statistical text analysis of functional protein information. Compared with controls, inflamed and non-inflamed UC mucosa displayed 9360 and 52 DE genes, respectively. Seventy-three non-pseudogenes were DE relative to both gender and inflammation. Mitochondrial processes were downregulated in inflamed and upregulated in non-inflamed UC mucosa, whereas angiogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were upregulated in both tissue states. Immune responses were upregulated in inflamed mucosa, whereas the non-inflamed UC mucosa presented both up- and downregulated gene sets. DE and enriched genes overlapped with genes present in inflammatory bowel disease genome-wide associated loci (p = 1.43 × 10−18), especially regarding immune responses, respiratory chain, angiogenesis, ER stress, and steroid hormone metabolism. Apart from confirming established pathophysiological mechanisms of immune cells, our study provides evidence for involvement of less described pathways (e.g., respiratory chain, ER stress, fatty-acid oxidation, steroid hormone metabolism and angiogenesis).",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,23,,2022,2022-06-22 00:00:00,"Jan Söderman, Linda Berglind, S.

Autoreactive CD4 T cell effector subsets (Th1,Th17) driving these diseases require increased glycolytic metabolism to upregulate key transcription factors (TF) like T-bet and RORγt that drive differentiation and proinflammatory responses. However, research in immunometabolism has demonstrated that mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules contributing to T cell fate and function. Eliminating autoreactive T cells by targeting glycolysis or ROS production is a potential strategy to inhibit autoreactive T cell activation without compromising systemic immune function. Additionally, increasing self-tolerance by promoting functional immunosuppressive CD4 T regulatory (Treg) cells is another alternative therapeutic for autoimmune disease. Tregs require increased ROS and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) for Foxp3 TF expression, differentiation, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine synthesis. Decreasing glycolytic activity or increasing glutathione and superoxide dismutase antioxidant activity can also be beneficial in inhibiting cytotoxic CD8 T cell effector responses. Current treatment options for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include global immunosuppression, antibodies to deplete immune cells, and anti-cytokine therapy. While effective in diminishing autoreactive T cells, they can also compromise other immune responses resulting in increased susceptibility to other diseases and complications. The impact of mitochondrial-derived ROS and immunometabolism reprogramming in autoreactive T cell differentiation could be a potential target for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Exploiting these pathways may delay autoimmune responses in T1D.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,12,,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,"M.

We defined a somatization comorbidity phenotype (SCP) and examined its influence on response to certolizumab pegol (CZP) using data from the PREDICT trial.MethodsPatients in PREDICT were randomized to the patient-reported Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) or physician-based Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for treatment response assessment. Post-hoc analyses identified patients with the SCP, which included diagnosis of depression, fibromyalgia/myalgias, and/or use of medications indicated for treatment of depression, anxiety, or neuropathic pain. The effect of the SCP on RAPID3 or CDAI response at week 12 and low disease activity (LDA; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≤ 3.2) at week 52, in week-12 responders, was analyzed using non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).ResultsAt baseline, 43% (313/733) of patients met the SCP classification. Patients with the SCP were 9% more likely to withdraw from the trial. American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses were 5–14% lower among those with the SCP, and 11% more patients reported adverse events (AEs). Patients without SCP in the CDAI arm were twice as likely to achieve LDA at week 52 compared with those with SCP (32% versus 16%). No differentiation by SCP was observed in the RAPID3 arm (pooled result 21.5%).ConclusionsWe operationalized a potentially important somatization comorbidity phenotype in a trial setting that was associated with a substantially lower likelihood of treatment response and a higher frequency of AEs. Including large numbers of patients with this phenotype in RA trials may reduce the measured clinical effectiveness of a new molecule.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01255761.

A National Population-Based Study of 162,283 Danish Adults","Objectives To identify patterns of multimorbidity in the general population and examine how these patterns are related to socio-demographic factors and health-related quality of life. Study design and setting We used latent class analysis to identify subgroups with statistically distinct and clinically meaningful disease patterns in a nationally representative sample of Danish adults (N = 162,283) aged 16+ years. The analysis was based on 15 chronic diseases. Results Seven classes with different disease patterns were identified: a class with no or only a single chronic condition (59% of the population) labeled “1) Relatively Healthy” and six classes with a very high prevalence of multimorbidity labeled; “2) Hypertension” (14%); “3) Musculoskeletal Disorders” (10%); “4) Headache-Mental Disorders” (7%); “5) Asthma-Allergy” (6%); “6) Complex Cardiometabolic Disorders” (3%); and “7) Complex Respiratory Disorders” (2%). Female gender was associated with an increased likelihood of belonging to any of the six multimorbidity classes except for class 2 (Hypertension). Low educational attainment predicted membership of all of the multimorbidity classes except for class 5 (Asthma-Allergy). Marked differences in health-related quality of life between the seven latent classes were found. Poor health-related quality of life was highly associated with membership of class 6 (Complex Cardiometabolic Disorders) and class 7 (Complex Respiratory Disorders). Despite different disease patterns, these two classes had nearly identical profiles in relation to health-related quality of life.

The lack of actual hot-rolled strip defect data sets currently limits further research on the classification of hot-rolled strip defects to some extent. In real production, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm has some difficulties, for example, the algorithm is not particularly accurate in classifying some uncommon defects. Therefore, further research is needed on how to apply deep learning to the actual detection of defects on the surface of hot rolled steel strip. In this paper, we proposed a hot rolled steel strip defect dataset called Xsteel surface defect dataset (X-SDD) which contains seven typical types of hot rolled strip defects with a total of 1360 defect images. Compared with the six defect types of the commonly used NEU surface defect database (NEU-CLS), our proposed X-SDD contains more types. Then, we adopt the newly proposed RepVGG algorithm and combine it with the spatial attention (SA) mechanism to verify the effect on the X-SDD. Finally, we apply multiple algorithms to test on our proposed X-SDD to provide the corresponding benchmarks. The test results show that our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 95.10% on the testset, which exceeds other comparable algorithms by a large margin. Meanwhile, our algorithm achieves the best results in Macro-Precision, Macro-Recall and Macro-F1-score metrics.",Symmetry,journal,1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,706,13,,2021,2021-04-17 00:00:00,"Xinglong Feng, Xian-wen Gao, Ling Luo","1641383061, 1797939, None",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff8ad53f6591409b3dd1c7947ca32d49ca3dc569,"Computer Science, Engineering, Materials Science",1641383061,['JournalArticle'],98.0,45.0
ca41132c7a80c07ca516e236dc3bad527e5a9cb1,10.3390/ma14081957,Wavelet Scattering and Neural Networks for Railhead Defect Identification,"Accurate and automatic railhead inspection is crucial for the operational safety of railway systems. Deep learning on visual images is effective in the automatic detection of railhead defects, but either intensive data requirements or ignoring defect sizes reduce its applicability. This paper developed a machine learning framework based on wavelet scattering networks (WSNs) and neural networks (NNs) for identifying railhead defects. WSNs are functionally equivalent to deep convolutional neural networks while containing no parameters, thus suitable for non-intensive datasets. NNs can restore location and size information. The publicly available rail surface discrete defects (RSDD) datasets were analyzed, including 67 Type-I railhead images acquired from express tracks and 128 Type-II images captured from ordinary/heavy haul tracks. The ultimate validation accuracy reached 99.80% and 99.44%, respectively. WSNs can extract implicit signal features, and the support vector machine classifier can improve the learning accuracy of NNs by over 6%. Three criteria, namely the precision, recall, and F-measure, were calculated for comparison with the literature. At the pixel level, the developed approach achieved three criteria of around 90%, outperforming former methods. At the defect level, the recall rates reached 100%, indicating all labeled defects were identified. The precision rates were around 75%, affected by the insignificant misidentified speckles (smaller than 20 pixels). Nonetheless, the developed learning framework was effective in identifying railhead defects.",Materials,journal,0b8373ea-5505-4c96-99ff-b8da87a2ce3e,Materials,,14,,2021,2021-04-01 00:00:00,Yang Jin,2122755150,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca41132c7a80c07ca516e236dc3bad527e5a9cb1,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2122755150,['JournalArticle'],10.0,43.0

However, the trained model does work well when a new production line is initiated with different equipment, processes, or detection devices. These variables make just tiny changes to the real-world model but have a significant impact on the classification result. To overcome these problems, we propose an evolutionary classifier with a Bayes kernel (BYEC) that can be adjusted with a small sample set to better adapt the model for a new production line. First, abundant features were introduced to cover detailed information about the defects. Second, we constructed a series of support vector machines (SVMs) with a random subspace of the features. Then, a Bayes classifier was trained as an evolutionary kernel fused with the results from the sub-SVM to form an integrated classifier. Finally, we proposed a method to adjust the Bayes evolutionary kernel with a small sample set. We compared the performance of this method to various algorithms; experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be adjusted with a small sample set to fit the changed model. Experimental evaluations were conducted to demonstrate the robustness, low requirement for samples, and adaptiveness of the proposed method.",EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing,journal,430b5d98-2f44-470f-94e9-f73baf19a7e1,EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing,1-13,2017,,2017,2017-07-17 00:00:00,"Mang Xiao, Mingming Jiang, Guangyao Li, Li Xie, Li Yi","47716385, 2152156754, 2151298646, 145046859, 2087922509",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ba029539da8acc5105ae2831c8533402f8509bd,"Computer Science, Engineering, Materials Science",47716385,['JournalArticle'],49.0,28.0

This work aims to develop and pilot a methodology to help decision makers target and prioritize sampling investigations and identify contaminated natural resources. Here we use random forest models to predict ∑PFAS in fish tissue; understanding PFAS levels in fish is particularly important in the CRB because fish can be a major component of tribal and indigenous people diet. Geospatial data, including land cover and distances to known or potential PFAS sources and industries, were leveraged as predictors for modeling. Models were developed and evaluated for Washington state and Oregon using limited available empirical data. Mapped predictions show several areas where detectable concentrations of PFAS in fish tissue are predicted to occur, but prior sampling has not yet confirmed. Variable importance is analyzed to identify potentially important sources of PFAS in fish in this region. The cost-effective methodologies demonstrated here can help address sparsity of existing PFAS occurrence data in environmental media in this and other regions while also giving insights into potentially important drivers and sources of PFAS in fish.",Environmental Science and Technology,journal,9efb20cf-7484-450d-8245-12dfbf639d3e,Environmental Science & Technology,14024 - 14035,57,,2023,2023-09-05 00:00:00,"N.

Here, the authors assess gut microbiota in early PD, REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and first-degree relatives of RBD and show PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs in RBD and their first-degree relatives. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been suggested to play an important role in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we performed a cross-sectional study to profile gut microbiota across early PD, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), first-degree relatives of RBD (RBD-FDR), and healthy controls, which could reflect the gut-brain staging model of PD. We show gut microbiota compositions are significantly altered in early PD and RBD compared with control and RBD-FDR. Depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and enrichment of pro-inflammatory Collinsella have already emerged in RBD and RBD-FDR after controlling potential confounders including antidepressants, osmotic laxatives, and bowel movement frequency. Random forest modelling identifies 12 microbial markers that are effective to distinguish RBD from control. These findings suggest that PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs at the prodromal stages of PD when RBD develops and starts to emerge in the younger RBD-FDR subjects.

Currently, we only have a limited understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of soil microorganisms, restricting our ability to assess long-term effects of climate and land-cover change on microbial roles in soil biogeochemistry. This study assesses the temporal trends in soil microbial biomass carbon and identifies the main drivers of biomass change regionally and globally to detect the areas sensitive to these environmental factors. Here, we combined a global soil microbial biomass carbon data set, random forest modelling, and environmental layers to predict spatial-temporal dynamics of microbial biomass carbon stocks from 1992 to 2013. Soil microbial biomass carbon stocks decreased globally by 3.4 ± 3.0% (mean ± 95% CI) between 1992 and 2013 for the predictable regions, equivalent to 149 Mt being lost over the period, or ~1‰ of soil C. Northern areas with high soil microbial carbon stocks experienced the strongest decrease, mostly driven by increasing temperatures. In contrast, land-cover change was a weaker global driver of change in microbial carbon, but had, in some cases, important regional effects. Soil microbial carbon is central to soil functions and services, but its spatial-temporal dynamics are unclear. Here the authors show global trends in soil microbial carbon, which suggests a global decrease in soil microbial carbon, mostly driven by temperature increases in northern areas.",Nature Communications,journal,43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,13,,2022,2022-07-20 00:00:00,"Guillaume Patoine, N.

Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used to detect frauds, but there is still a need to apply state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to reduce fraud losses. Comparative analysis of both machine learning and deep learning algorithms was performed to find efficient outcomes.

One of the crucial issues with using credit cards is fraud, which is a serious challenge in the realm of online transactions. Consequently, there is a huge need to develop the best approach possible to using machine learning in order to prevent almost all fraudulent credit card transactions. This paper studies a total of 66 machine learning models based on two stages of evaluation. A real-world credit card fraud detection dataset of European cardholders is used in each model along with stratified K-fold cross-validation. In the first stage, nine machine learning algorithms are tested to detect fraudulent transactions. The best three algorithms are nominated to be used again in the second stage, with 19 resampling techniques used with each one of the best three algorithms. Out of 330 evaluation metric values that took nearly one month to obtain, the All K-Nearest Neighbors (AllKNN) undersampling technique along with CatBoost (AllKNN-CatBoost) is considered to be the best proposed model. Accordingly, the AllKNN-CatBoost model is compared with related works. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms previous models with an AUC value of 97.94%, a Recall value of 95.91%, and an F1-Score value of 87.40%.",Electronics,journal,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,,2022,2022-02-21 00:00:00,"Noor Saleh Alfaiz, S.

For this end, it is obligatory for financial institutions to continuously improve their fraud detection systems to reduce huge losses. The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel system for credit card fraud detection based on sequential modeling of data, using attention mechanism and LSTM deep recurrent neural networks. The proposed model, compared to previous studies, considers the sequential nature of transactional data and allows the classifier to identify the most important transactions in the input sequence that predict at higher accuracy fraudulent transactions. Precisely, the robustness of our model is built by combining the strength of three sub-methods; the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for selecting the most useful predictive features, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for incorporating transaction sequences and the attention mechanism to enhance LSTM performances. The experimentations of our model give strong results in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.",Journal of Big Data,journal,d60da343-ab92-4310-b3d7-2c0860287a9d,Journal of Big Data,,8,,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,"Ibtissam Benchaji, Samira Douzi, B.

Idiopathic RBD occurs in the absence of any neurological disease or other possible cause, is male-predominant and its clinical course is generally chronic progressive. Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders. Because RBD antecedes the development of these disorders by several years or decades, its recognition may enable the delay or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders through the early application of neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapies in the future.",The EPMA Journal,journal,5c44f3b8-070b-4771-88c8-57717d28f5ab,The EPMA Journal,451 - 458,2,,2011,2011-06-29 00:00:00,S.

Deep learning has been widely applied in medical imaging to help automate and improve medical image analysis. Medical imaging techniques such as MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays produce large amounts of data that can be difficult for human experts to accurately interpret and analyze. Deep learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns in medical images, identify abnormal features, and make predictions about patient outcomes. The present research work exposes an automatic classification model to detect brain tumors in brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). The data set is found in the Kaggle repository, which consists of 253 MRI images: 155 with brain tumors and 98 without. The proposed model can classify brain tumor MRI images with 91% accuracy.

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,13,,2018,2018-03-27 00:00:00,"Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, Vassilios Assimakopoulos","2276105, 2146553, 90170330",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6b3aeb29b5b4034d84598424b1edfb29acf2a6c,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Medicine",2276105,['JournalArticle'],992.0,90.0

While most contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales. An E(3)-equivariant deep learning interatomic potential is introduced for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations. The method obtains state-of-the-art accuracy, can faithfully describe dynamics of complex systems with remarkable sample efficiency.",Nature Communications,journal,43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,13,,2021,2021-01-08 00:00:00,"Simon L.

The HAR plays a vital role in learning about a patient’s abnormal activities; based upon this information, the patient’s psychological state can be estimated. An epileptic seizure is a neurological disorder of the human brain and affects millions of people worldwide. If epilepsy is diagnosed correctly and in an early stage, then up to 70% of people can be seizure-free. There is a need for intelligent automatic HAR systems that help clinicians diagnose neurological disorders accurately. In this research, we proposed a Deep Learning (DL) model that enables the detection of epileptic seizures in an automated way, addressing a need in clinical research. To recognize epileptic seizures from brain activities, EEG is a raw but good source of information. In previous studies, many techniques used raw data from EEG to help recognize epileptic patient activities; however, the applied method of extracting features required much intensive expertise from clinical aspects such as radiology and clinical methods. The image data are also used to diagnose epileptic seizures, but applying Machine Learning (ML) methods could address the overfitting problem. In this research, we mainly focused on classifying epilepsy through physical epileptic activities instead of feature engineering and performed the detection of epileptic seizures in three steps. In the first step, we used the open-source numerical dataset of epilepsy of Bonn university from the UCI Machine Learning repository. In the second step, data were fed to the proposed ELM model for training in different training and testing ratios with a little bit of rescaling because the dataset was already pre-processed, normalized, and restructured. In the third step, epileptic and non-epileptic activity was recognized, and in this step, EEG signal feature extraction was automatically performed by a DL model named ELM; features were selected by a Feature Selection (FS) algorithm based on ELM and the final classification was performed using the ELM classifier. In our presented research, seven different ML algorithms were applied for the binary classification of epileptic activities, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Boosting Classifier (SGDC), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GB), Decision Trees (DT), and three deep learning models named Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). After deep analysis, it is observed that the best results were obtained by our proposed DL model, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), with an accuracy of 100% accuracy and a 0.99 AUC. Such high performance has not attained in previous research. The proposed model’s performance was checked with other models in terms of performance parameters, namely confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, sensitivity, and the ROC curve.",Biomedicines,journal,abc0c598-b988-4841-a8c5-65bfa6f3df77,Biomedicines,,11,,2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,"Ummara Ayman, M.

Design Prospective feasibility study. Setting The study was conducted in a university setting and participants’ homes. Participants Thirty-five volunteers ≥55 years old were recruited. Intervention Participants were asked to follow a balance exercise programme 7 days a week for 3 weeks using a phone application. Seventeen participants trained for a further 3 weeks. Outcome measures Postural sway measures during quiet standing with feet at shoulder width apart and feet together, one leg standing and tandem stance were measured at baseline, and at the end of the 3 and 6 training weeks; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) assessed participants’ physical activity level before training; and app acceptability was recorded using a user experience questionnaire. Results Participants on the 3 and 6-week programme on average completed 20 (±5) and 38 (±11) days of training, respectively, and all scored moderate to high on the IPAQ. Between baseline and the 3-week assessments, statistically significant improvements were observed for anteroposterior sway, mediolateral sway, sway area during tandem stance, for anteroposterior sway during one leg standing and for sway area during feet together stance. Improvements were observed at 6 week compared with baseline but those between 3 and 6 weeks were not significant. Based on the questionnaire, participants reported that the app is an appropriate tool for balance training (77%), they reported benefits from the training (50%) and found it easy to fit it into daily routine (88%). Conclusion The high level of adherence and improvements observed in the analysed measures demonstrate the feasibility of using an app to train balance in moderately to highly physically active older participants. This demonstrates that given appropriate tools the older population is positive towards and receptive of digital interventions aimed to improve balance.",BMJ Open,journal,e6216b43-2428-4aaf-8101-b40e1dfd2810,BMJ Open,,10,,2020,2020-12-01 00:00:00,"E.

Activity levels are generally below recommended levels and reduce with age. There is concern that exercise levels may be further reduced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital approaches may offer a means for older people to engage in strength and balance exercises independently in their own homes. The objective of this review was to identify and evaluate existing apps and websites to support independent engagement in strength and balance exercises by older people. Methods We conducted a rapid review of apps and websites, following PRISMA guidelines. We searched for available apps in the Android and iOS app stores, and performed a database search (MEDLINE and EMBASE) for apps in development. We searched for websites using the Google search engine. Apps and websites were evaluated in terms of existing evidence for effectiveness, use of behaviour change techniques (BCTs), and quality. Results We evaluated 13 apps and 24 websites on the basis of our selection criteria. Considering the evidence-base, quality and BCT scores, four apps and six websites are recommended for use by older people who wish to engage in exercise independently in their own homes. No apps or websites have been to RCT evaluation at the time of review. Conclusions Apps and websites have the potential to provide a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means for many older adults to engage in strength and balance training and reduce falls risk.",BMC Geriatrics,journal,f0ed97d4-5d9b-4cb1-892a-ae0f91b368bc,BMC Geriatrics,,20,,2020,2020-08-24 00:00:00,"L.

Although the sentiment analysis uses such data to develop useful applications in people’s daily lives, there are still failures in this type of analysis, either by the restricted number of words contained in the word dictionaries or because they do not consider the most diverse parameters that can influence the sentiments in a sentence; thus, more reliable results can be obtained, if the users profile information and their writing characteristics are considered. This research suggests that one of the most relevant parameter contained in the user profile is the age group, showing that there are typical behaviors among users of the same age group, specifically, when these users write about the same topic. A detailed analysis with 7000 sentences was performed to determine which characteristics are relevant, such as, the use of punctuation, number of characters, media sharing, topics, among others; and which ones can be disregarded for the age groups classification. Different learning machine algorithms are tested for the classification of the teenager and adult age group, and the deep convolutional neural network had the best performance, reaching a precision of 0.95 in the validation tests. Furthermore, in order to validate the usefulness of the proposed model for classifying age groups, it is implemented into the enhanced sentiment metric (eSM). In the performance validation, subjective tests are performed and the eSM with the proposed model reached a root mean square error and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.25 and 0.94, respectively, outperforming the eSM metric, when the age group information is not available.",IEEE Access,journal,2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,10805-10816,5,,2017,2017-05-23 00:00:00,"R.

As a result, it is crucial for companies to implement robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive data from intrusion, which can lead to significant financial losses. Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) require further enhancements to reduce false positives as well as enhance overall accuracy. To minimize security risks, data analytics and machine learning can be utilized to create data-driven recommendations and decisions based on the input data. This study focuses on developing machine learning models that can identify cyber-attacks and enhance IDS system performance. This paper employed logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest algorithms on the UNSW-NB15 network traffic dataset, utilizing in-depth exploratory data analysis, and feature selection using correlation analysis and random sampling to compare model accuracy and effectiveness. The performance and confusion matrix results indicate that the Random Forest model is the best option for identifying cyber-attacks, with a remarkable F1 score of 97.80%, accuracy of 98.63%, and low false alarm rate of 1.36%, and thus should be considered to improve IDS system security.",Algorithms,journal,e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,64,17,,2024,2024-02-01 00:00:00,"Shweta More, Moad Idrissi, Haitham H.

A codebook of 198 variables related to different aspects of pre‐attack behavior is applied to a sample of 55 lone actor terrorists. Data were drawn from open‐source materials and complemented where possible with primary sources. Most lone actors are not highly lethal or surreptitious attackers. They are generally poor at maintaining operational security, leak their motivations and capabilities in numerous ways, and generally do so months and even years before an attack. Moreover, the “loneness” thought to define this type of terrorism is generally absent; most lone actors uphold social ties that are crucial to their adoption and maintenance of the motivation and capability to commit terrorist violence. The results offer concrete input for those working to detect and prevent this form of terrorism and argue for a re‐evaluation of the “lone actor” concept.",Journal of Forensic Sciences,journal,632c6d05-019f-4296-8a4e-842e860ae5ca,Journal of Forensic Sciences,,63,,2018,2018-07-01 00:00:00,"B.

These anomalies include narrow cell mini-columns and variable neuron density. However, difficulty obtaining sufficient post-mortem samples has often prevented investigations from converging on reproducible measures. Recent advances in processing magnetic resonance diffusion weighted images (DWI) make in vivo characterization of neuronal cytoarchitecture a potential alternative to post-mortem studies. Using extensive DWI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmentsm (ABCD®) study 142 individuals with an Autism diagnosis were compared with 8971 controls using a restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) framework that characterized total neurite density (TND), its component restricted normalized directional diffusion (RND), and restricted normalized isotropic diffusion (RNI). A significant decrease in TND was observed in Autism in the right cerebellar cortex (β=-0.005, SE =0.0015, p=0.0267), with significant decreases in RNI and significant increases in RND found diffusely throughout posterior and anterior aspects of the brain, respectively. Furthermore, these regions remained significant in post-hoc analysis when the ASD sample was compared against a subset of 1404 individuals with other psychiatric conditions (pulled from the original 8971). These findings highlight the importance of characterizing neuron cytoarchitecture in Autism and the significance of their incorporation as physiological covariates in future studies. Lay abstract Children with autism have differences in neuron structure unique from the general population and populations with attention, anxiety, and depression disorders. Brain imaging data on over 11,000 children was acquired at ages 9 and 11 years-of-age. Estimates of neuron density were derived from brain imaging data using recently validated techniques and comparative groups were composed using parent reported diagnosis of autism and other common psychiatric disorders. Consistent macro-structural changes in brain have been difficult to replicate and micro-structural changes have been historically difficult to acquire with other methodologies. We identified regional differences in the density of neuron cell bodies, neuron branching, and total neuron density in those with a reported diagnosis of ASD. Findings were consistent when compared against those with other psychiatric disorders in post-hoc analysis. These findings demonstrate the viability and importance of investigating in vivo changes to neurons in those with autism to advance our current understanding of related physiology.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,bioRxiv,,,,2023,2023-03-26 00:00:00,"Z.

Quantitative measurement of T1 and T2 relaxation, and diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) yield metrics related to the pathology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that occurs across the spectrum of MS. Objective: To use relaxation and DBSI MRI metrics to describe measures of neuroinflammation, myelin and axons in different MS subtypes. Methods: 103 participants (20 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 33 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 30 secondary progressive MS and 20 primary progressive MS) underwent quantitative T1, T2, DBSI and conventional 3T MRI. Whole brain, normal-appearing white matter, lesion and corpus callosum MRI metrics were compared across MS subtypes. Results: A gradation of MRI metric values was seen from CIS to RRMS to progressive MS. RRMS demonstrated large oedema-related differences, while progressive MS had the most extensive abnormalities in myelin and axonal measures. Conclusion: Relaxation and DBSI-derived MRI measures show differences between MS subtypes related to the severity and composition of underlying tissue damage. RRMS showed oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS. Progressive MS had even more evidence of increased oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS and RRMS.",Multiple Sclerosis,journal,8ad5a503-1e51-40ba-abc9-a5ba2920590e,Multiple Sclerosis Journal,418 - 428,28,,2021,2021-06-16 00:00:00,"I.

dd131d2937b46e2790ff67241886e8be9efcce38,10.1155/2022/8598305,PAS: Performance-Aware Job Scheduling for Big Data Processing Systems,"Big data analytics has become increasingly vital in many modern enterprise applications such as user profiling and business process optimization. Today’s big data processing systems, such as Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Hive, treat big data applications as a batch of jobs for scheduling. Existing schedulers in production systems often maintain fair allocation without considering application performance and resource utilization simultaneously. It is challenging to perform job scheduling in big data systems to achieve both low turnaround time and high resource utilization due to the high complexity in data processing logics and the dynamic variation in workloads. In this article, we propose a performance-aware scheduler, referred to as PAS, which dynamically schedules big data jobs in Hadoop YARN and Spark and autonomously adjusts scheduling policies to improve application performance and resource utilization. Specifically, PAS schedules multiple concurrent jobs using different policies based on the predicted job completion time and employs a greedy approach and a one-step lookahead strategy to opportunistically maximize the average job performance while still maintaining a satisfactory level of resource utilization. We implement PAS in Hadoop YARN and evaluate its performance with HiBench, a well-known big data processing benchmark. Experimental results show that PAS reduces the average turnaround time by 25% and the makespan by 15% in comparison with four state-of-the-art schedulers.",Security and Communication Networks,journal,02a4454a-84c8-471c-9b40-cc045d4f3223,Security and Communication Networks,,,,2022,2022-04-12 00:00:00,"Yiren Li, Tieke Li, Pei Shen, Liang Hao, Jin Yang, Zhengtong Zhang, Junhao Chen, Liang Bao","2111149533, 1778777, 2149290130, 2162376257, 2157358539, 2162412589, 2115267766, 2103958254",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd131d2937b46e2790ff67241886e8be9efcce38,"Computer Science, Engineering",2111149533,,5.0,44.0

This study was conducted to compare the differences of sleep disorders in vestibular migraine (VM) patients and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patients. Methods: VM patients, BPPV patients, and healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Pittsburgh sleep quality index and polysomnography monitoring were used as subjective and objective, respectively, evaluation methods to evaluate the sleep quality of participants in the latest month. Results: Fifty-seven BPPV patients, 48 VM patients, and 42 HCs were included in this study. There were 79.16% VM patients, 54.39% BPPV patients, and 14.28% HCs with sleep disorders. The difference in the incidence rate of sleep disorders was significant between VM patients and BPPV patients (p = 0.008) and significantly higher in both the VM group (p < 0.00001) and BPPV group (p = 0.00004) than in the HC groups (14.28%). Compared with BPPV patients, the VM patients had the significantly lower sleep efficiency (p < 0.001) and N3 (p < 0.001) and the significantly higher time of wake-up after sleep onset (p < 0.001), N1 (p < 0.001), and N2 (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the VM patients had significantly higher incidence rates of severe obstructive sleep apnea hypoventilation syndrome (p = 0.001) and periodic leg movement in sleep (p = 0.016). Conclusion: The incidence rate of sleep disorders was significantly higher in both VM and BPPV patients than in the HC groups. To improve the curative effects, clinicians should pay more attention to the comorbidity of sleep disorders in treating VM and BPPV.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,journal,07931092-9002-4e9f-a62d-00af30be540f,Frontiers in Psychiatry,,12,,2021,2021-11-18 00:00:00,"Hui Xue, Baojun Wang, Tianyu Meng, Shijun Zhao, Qingyin Wang, Xin Zhang, Min-Sung Kang, Wen-ping Xiang","2053313222, 2156645062, 151234498, 2110773073, 2142378459, 2149172322, 2111622351, 1786324",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a4edf0c77f3c41910a8269abaa805a517cfc5b6,Medicine,2053313222,['JournalArticle'],13.0,54.0

To this end, we build base-ml, a comprehensive MVA/ML software tool, and applied it to three increasingly difficult clinical objectives in differentiation of common vestibular disorders, using data from a large prospective clinical patient registry (DizzyReg). Methods: Base-ml features a full MVA/ML pipeline for classification of multimodal patient data, comprising tools for data loading and pre-processing; a stringent scheme for nested and stratified cross-validation including hyper-parameter optimization; a set of 11 classifiers, ranging from commonly used algorithms like logistic regression and random forests, to artificial neural network models, including a graph-based deep learning model which we recently proposed; a multi-faceted evaluation of classification metrics; tools from the domain of “Explainable AI” that illustrate the input distribution and a statistical analysis of the most important features identified by multiple classifiers. Results: In the first clinical task, classification of the bilateral vestibular failure (N = 66) vs. functional dizziness (N = 346) was possible with a classification accuracy ranging up to 92.5% (Random Forest). In the second task, primary functional dizziness (N = 151) vs. secondary functional dizziness (following an organic vestibular syndrome) (N = 204), was classifiable with an accuracy ranging from 56.5 to 64.2% (k-nearest neighbors/logistic regression). The third task compared four episodic disorders, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (N = 134), vestibular paroxysmia (N = 49), Menière disease (N = 142) and vestibular migraine (N = 215). Classification accuracy ranged between 25.9 and 50.4% (Naïve Bayes/Support Vector Machine). Recent (graph-) deep learning models classified well in all three tasks, but not significantly better than more traditional ML methods. Classifiers reliably identified clinically relevant features as most important toward classification. Conclusion: The three clinical tasks yielded classification results that correlate with the clinical intuition regarding the difficulty of diagnosis. It is favorable to apply an array of MVA/ML algorithms rather than a single one, to avoid under-estimation of classification accuracy. Base-ml provides a systematic benchmarking of classifiers, with a standardized output of MVA/ML performance on clinical tasks. To alleviate re-implementation efforts, we provide base-ml as an open-source tool for the community.",Frontiers in Neurology,journal,3513ce18-3757-4358-b15f-7060af98e6d0,Frontiers in Neurology,,12,,2021,2021-08-02 00:00:00,"G.

In the presence of complex diagnostic information, automated systems can support human decision making. Recent developments in machine learning might facilitate bedside diagnosis of VM and MD. Methods Data of this study originate from the prospective patient registry of the German Centre for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, a specialized tertiary treatment center at the University Hospital Munich. The classification task was to differentiate cases of VM, MD from other vestibular disease entities. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) were used for classification. Results A total of 1357 patients were included (mean age 52.9, SD 15.9, 54.7% female), 9.9% with MD and 15.6% with VM. DNN models yielded an accuracy of 98.4 ± 0.5%, a precision of 96.3 ± 3.9%, and a sensitivity of 85.4 ± 3.9% for VM, and an accuracy of 98.0 ± 1.0%, a precision of 90.4 ± 6.2% and a sensitivity of 89.9 ± 4.6% for MD. BDT yielded an accuracy of 84.5 ± 0.5%, precision of 51.8 ± 6.1%, sensitivity of 16.9 ± 1.7% for VM, and an accuracy of 93.3 ± 0.7%, precision 76.0 ± 6.7%, sensitivity 41.7 ± 2.9% for MD.

Methods This paper moves the analysis of risk posed to others forward by comparing six different vehicular modes, separating road types (major vs minor roads in urban vs rural settings). The comparison of risk posed by men and women for all these modes is also novel. Results Per-vehicle kilometre, buses and lorries pose much the highest risk to others, while cycles pose the lowest. Motorcycles pose a substantially higher per-km risk to others than cars. The fatality risk posed by cars or vans to ORUs per km is higher in rural areas. Risk posed is generally higher on major roads, although not in the case of lorries, suggesting a link to higher speeds. Men pose higher per-km risk to others than women for all modes except buses, as well as being over-represented among users of the most dangerous vehicles. Conclusions Future research should examine more settings, adjust for spatial and temporal confounders, or examine how infrastructure or route characteristics affect risk posed to others. Although for most victims the other vehicle involved is a car, results suggest policy-makers should also seek to reduce disproportionate risks posed by the more dangerous vehicles, for instance, by discouraging motorcycling. Finally, given higher risk posed to others by men across five of six modes analysed, policy-makers should consider how to reduce persistent large gender imbalances in jobs involving driving.",Injury Prevention,journal,dc811d66-51f0-49c7-a652-62e4da8433a3,Injury Prevention,71 - 76,27,,2020,2020-03-30 00:00:00,"R.

A more precise characterization of the environment will allow a better dealing with genotype-by-environment-by-management interactions. Therefore, space and time dependencies of the crop production processes have to be considered. The use of novel sensor technologies has drastically increased the amount and diversity of phenotypic data from agronomic field trials. Existing data management systems either do not consider space and time, are not customizable to individual needs such as field trial handling, or have restricted availability. Hence, we propose an integrative data management and information system (DMIS) for handling of traditional and novel sensor-based phenotypic, environmental and management data. The DMIS must be customizable, applicable and scalable from individual users to organizations. Key element of the system is a dynamic PostgreSQL database with GIS-extension, capable of importing, storing and managing all types of data including images. The database references every structural database object and measurement in a threefold approach with semantic, spatial and temporal reference. Timestamps and geo-coordinates allow automated linking of all data. Traits can be precisely defined individually or uploaded as predefined lists. Filtering and selection routines allow compilation of all data for visualization via tables, charts or maps and for export and external statistical analysis. New possibilities of environmental information-based planning of field trials, weather-guided phenotyping and data analysis for outlier or hot-spot detection are demonstrated. The DMIS supports users in handling experimental field trials with crop plants and modern phenotyping methods. It focuses on linking all space and time dependent processes of plant production. Weather, soil and management, as well as growth and yield formation of the plants can be depicted, thus allowing a more precise interpretation of the results in relation to environment and management. Breeders, extension specialists, official testing agencies and agricultural scientists are assisted in all steps of a typical workflow with planning, designing, conducting, controlling and analyzing field trials to generate new information for decision support in the crop improvement process.",Plant Methods,journal,7218da31-236c-47af-8931-874dcec1be68,Plant Methods,,16,,2020,2020-04-21 00:00:00,"A.

Driven by modern deep-learning approaches, RootNav 2.0 replaces previously manual and semi-automatic feature extraction with an extremely deep multi-task Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The network has been designed to explicitly combine local pixel information with global scene information in order to accurately segment small root features across high-resolution images. In addition, the network simultaneously locates seeds, and first and second order root tips to drive a search algorithm seeking optimal paths throughout the image, extracting accurate architectures without user interaction. The proposed method is evaluated on images of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from a seedling assay. The results are compared with semi-automatic analysis via the original RootNav tool, demonstrating comparable accuracy, with a 10-fold increase in speed. We then demonstrate the ability of the network to adapt to different plant species via transfer learning, offering similar accuracy when transferred to an Arabidopsis thaliana plate assay. We transfer for a final time to images of Brassica napus from a hydroponic assay, and still demonstrate good accuracy despite many fewer training images. The tool outputs root architectures in the widely accepted RSML standard, for which numerous analysis packages exist (http://rootsystemml.github.io/), as well as segmentation masks compatible with other automated measurement tools.",bioRxiv,journal,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,GigaScience,,8,,2019,2019-07-20 00:00:00,"R.

Phenotyping roots in soil is often challenging due to the roots being difficult to access and the use of time consuming manual methods. Rhizotrons allow visual inspection of root growth through transparent surfaces. Agronomists currently manually label photographs of roots obtained from rhizotrons using a line-intersect method to obtain root length density and rooting depth measurements which are essential for their experiments. We investigate the effectiveness of an automated image segmentation method based on the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to enable such measurements. We design a data-set of 50 annotated chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) root images which we use to train, validate and test the system and compare against a baseline built using the Frangi vesselness filter. We obtain metrics using manual annotations and line-intersect counts. Our results on the held out data show our proposed automated segmentation system to be a viable solution for detecting and quantifying roots.

One of the key factors is cloudiness, which can be presented not only as a percentage of the sky area covered by clouds but also many additional parameters, such as the type of clouds, the distribution of clouds across atmospheric layers, and their height. The use of machine learning algorithms to forecast the generation of solar power plants requires retrospective data over a long period and formalising the features; however, retrospective data with detailed information about cloudiness are normally recorded in the natural language format. This paper proposes an algorithm for processing such records to convert them into a binary feature vector. Experiments conducted on data from a real solar power plant showed that this algorithm increases the accuracy of short-term solar irradiance forecasts by 5–15%, depending on the quality metric used. At the same time, adding features makes the model less transparent to the user, which is a significant drawback from the point of view of explainable artificial intelligence. Therefore, the paper uses an additive explanation algorithm based on the Shapley vector to interpret the model’s output. It is shown that this approach allows the machine learning model to explain why it generates a particular forecast, which will provide a greater level of trust in intelligent information systems in the power industry.",Algorithms,journal,e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,150,17,,2024,2024-04-02 00:00:00,"P.

Eligible studies were articles, reviews, editorial material, and proceeding papers. We retrieved 55,353 documents published between 1905 and 2021. The annual scientific production is exponential with a mean annual growth rate of 6.8% since 1989. The 1988–2021 co-cited reference network identified 50 distinct clusters that presented significant modularity and silhouette scores indicating highly credible clusters (Q = 0.848, S = 0.939). This network identified 6 major research trends on physical activity, namely cardiovascular diseases, somatic disorders, cognitive decline/dementia, mental illness, athletes' performance, related health issues, and eating disorders, and the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus on the latest research trends found that greenness/urbanicity (2014), concussion/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (2015), and COVID-19 (2019) were the most active clusters of research.

In this circumstance, there has been a large number of energy-related international investment studies. However, the existing academic literature lacks a systematic scientometric analysis of this research topic, so this paper will fill this gap. Using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and HisCite, this paper analyzes 1014 articles published in the WoS SSCI Collection from January 1998 to March 2022 on the energy-related international investment. This paper comprehensively analyzes this field from four evolutionary dimensions. In the discipline and mainstream journals dimension, the largest change lies in the fact that more than three different disciplines flow into mathematics, while the journal “Environmental Science and Pollution Research” shows a dramatic growth in relevant publications after 2015. Keyword evolution shows a gradual deepening emphasis from attracting energy-related international investment to systematically analyzing the influencing mechanisms of the international investment-energy-environmental quality nexus.

0df8a938848c989a6eb48b18c2546021b8299a3e,10.3390/sym12091458,An Efficient Intrusion Detection Method Based on LightGBM and Autoencoder,"Due to the insidious characteristics of network intrusion behaviors, developing an efficient intrusion detection system is still a big challenge, especially in the era of big data where the number of traffic and the dimension of each traffic feature are high. Because of the shortcomings of traditional common machine learning algorithms in network intrusion detection, such as insufficient accuracy, a network intrusion detection system based on LightGBM and autoencoder (AE) is proposed. The LightGBM-AE model proposed in this paper includes three steps: data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The LightGBM-AE model adopts the LightGBM algorithm for feature selection, and then uses an autoencoder for training and detection. When a set of data containing network intrusion behaviors are inputted into an autoencoder, there is a large reconstruction error between the original input data and the reconstructed data obtained by the autoencoder, which provides a basis for intrusion detection. According to the reconstruction error, an appropriate threshold is set to distinguish symmetrically between normal behavior and attack behavior. The experiment is carried out on the NSL-KDD dataset and implemented using Pytorch. In addition to autoencoder, variational autoencoder (VAE) and denoising autoencoder (DAE) are also used for intrusion detection and are compared with existing machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, GBDT, and XGBoost. The evaluation is carried out through classification evaluation indexes such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. The experimental results show that the method can efficiently separate the attack behavior from normal behavior according to the reconstruction error. Compared with other methods, the effectiveness and superiority of this method are verified.",Symmetry,journal,1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,1458,12,,2020,2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Chaofei Tang, Nurbol Luktarhan, Yuxin Zhao","80825310, 3123725, 2109933437",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0df8a938848c989a6eb48b18c2546021b8299a3e,"Computer Science, Engineering",80825310,['JournalArticle'],47.0,31.0

We uniquely combine these feature selection tools to refine the input space, enhancing the detection capabilities of the ensemble learners. Extra Trees, as the ensemble technique of choice, exhibits exemplary performance, culminating in a near-perfect 99.99% accuracy rate in botnet classification across varied datasets. Our model not only surpasses previous benchmarks but also demonstrates exceptional adaptability to new botnet phenomena, ensuring persistent accuracy in a landscape of evolving threats. Detailed comparative analyses manifest our model's superiority, consistently achieving over 99% True Positive Rates and an unprecedented False Positive Rate close to 0.00%, thereby setting a new precedent for reliability in botnet detection.

Contributing factors are elements in the healthcare process (eg, communication failures) that instigate an event or allow an event to occur. Contributing factors can be used to further investigate why safety events occurred. Methods We used 10 years of self-reported PSE reports from a multihospital healthcare system in the USA. Reports were first selected by event date. We calculated χ2 values for each ngram in the bag-of-words then selected N ngrams with the highest χ2 values. Then, PSE reports were filtered to only include the sentences containing the selected ngrams. Such sentences were called information-rich sentences. We compared two feature extraction techniques from free-text data: (1) baseline bag-of-words features and (2) features from information-rich sentences. Three machine learning algorithms were used to categorise five contributing factors representing sociotechnical errors: communication/hand-off failure, technology issue, policy/procedure issue, distractions/interruptions and lapse/slip. We trained 15 binary classifiers (five contributing factors * three machine learning models). The models’ performances were evaluated according to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), precision, recall, and F1-score. Results Applying the information-rich sentence selection algorithm boosted the contributing factor categorisation performance. Comparing the AUPRCs, the proposed NLP approach improved the categorisation performance of two and achieved comparable results with baseline in categorising three contributing factors. Conclusions Information-rich sentence selection can be incorporated to extract the sentences in free-text event narratives in which the contributing factor information is embedded.",BMJ Health & Care Informatics,journal,88b9565b-577a-44e3-b26e-84ad5f1598a2,BMJ Health & Care Informatics,,30,,2023,2023-05-01 00:00:00,"A.

The National Academy of Medicine recognizes diagnostic errors, defined as “the failure to establish an accurate and timely explanation of a patient’s health problem(s) or to communicate that explanation to the patient,”1 as a major health care issue. Diagnostic errors include delayed diagnoses, wrong diagnoses, and missed diagnoses. Despite the personal and societal consequences of diagnostic errors, they are often unrecognized and unaddressed in patient safety and in health care quality metrics and guidelines. The association between diagnostic errors and health care disparities has received even less attention to date. Disparities in health care access and outcomes by race and ethnicity, sex, gender, geographic location, and socioeconomic status are well documented and persistent. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed and been associated with increasing these deep-seated disparities in health and health care in the US.2 Even before the pandemic, in 2011, US health care disparities were estimated to cost $309 billion annually.3 Few studies have examined the association between diagnostic errors and health care disparities. One study suggested the potential for misdiagnosis based on the results of genetic testing when using diagnostic tools that were developed with less diverse patient populations.4 Another study indicated that Black patients are more likely than White patients to be underdiagnosed with depression during their first primary care visit for mental health needs.5 Similarly, Black children are less likely to be diagnosed with otitis media compared with White children with similar presentations.6 This limited evidence for diagnostic disparities most likely reflects a dearth of research rather than an absence of disparities. Diagnostic errors and disparities, twin challenges in health care, can and should be addressed by implementing research and quality improvement initiatives, policy and payment reform, and technology and by educating clinicians about the importance of evidence-based use of diagnostic tools and the contributions of social determinants of health to disparities in care. The proliferation of big data and associated artificial intelligence (AI) methods provides yet another avenue to address these challenges. For example, computer decision support has been associated with reduced inequities in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis,7 likely by reducing implicit bias. The health care industry is emerging as a leader in the adoption of AI through sophisticated machine learning– assisted diagnostic tools. For clinical trials, AI has the potential to support every stage of the process, including finding a trial in which to enroll, addressing patient-centric enrollment issues, and assessing trial medication adherence with remote and digital monitoring. It is equally important to tap into the opportunities provided by big data and AI to detect and address diagnostic disparities in populations at risk for such disparities. In a recent study, machine learning was used to develop a new algorithm to measure the severity of knee osteoarthritis based on existing radiologic data.8 With use of the well-established standard Kellgren-Lawrence grading system to classify osteoarthritis, Black patients had more severe osteoarthritis than did White patients. However, adjustment for Kellgren-Lawrence grading scores did not reduce or eliminate racial differences in patient-reported knee pain. Applying an AI-driven algorithmic measure markedly improved the predictive performance of the measure and reduced the racial disparity in patient-reported pain.8 Unlike the standard severity measure, which was developed Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.",JAMA Health Forum,journal,424be4c6-0550-4f1d-91ca-08f8ef523c47,JAMA health forum,"

One potential limitation of LDCT screening is overdiagnosis of slow growing and indolent cancers. In this study, peritumoral and intratumoral radiomics was used to identify a vulnerable subset of lung patients associated with poor survival outcomes. Incident lung cancer patients from the NLST were split into training and test cohorts and an external cohort of non-screen detected adenocarcinomas was used for further validation. After removing redundant and non-reproducible radiomics features, backward elimination analyses identified a single model which was subjected to Classification and Regression Tree to stratify patients into three risk-groups based on two radiomics features (NGTDM Busyness and Statistical Root Mean Square [RMS]). The final model was validated in the test cohort and the cohort of non-screen detected adenocarcinomas. Using a radio-genomics dataset, Statistical RMS was significantly associated with FOXF2 gene by both correlation and two-group analyses. Our rigorous approach generated a novel radiomics model that identified a vulnerable high-risk group of early stage patients associated with poor outcomes. These patients may require aggressive follow-up and/or adjuvant therapy to mitigate their poor outcomes.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,,2020,2020-06-29 00:00:00,"J.

Here we report the design of a series of inositol phosphate analogs as crystallization inhibitors, among which 4,6-di-O-(methoxy-diethyleneglycol)-myo-inositol-1,2,3,5-tetrakis(phosphate), (OEG2)2-IP4, displays increased in vitro activity, as well as more favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles than IP6 after subcutaneous injection. (OEG2)2-IP4 potently stabilizes calciprotein particle (CPP) growth, consistently demonstrates low micromolar activity in different in vitro models of VC (i.e., human serum, primary cell cultures, and tissue explants), and largely abolishes the development of VC in rodent models, while not causing toxicity related to serum calcium chelation. The data suggest a mechanism of action independent of the etiology of VC, whereby (OEG2)2-IP4 disrupts the nucleation and growth of pathological calcification. Cardiovascular calcification is a serious pathology for which effective pharmacological treatments are lacking. Here the authors show that an optimized oligo(ethylene glycol) derivative of inositol phosphate interferes with calcium phosphate crystallization and inhibits soft tissue calcification in vivo following subcutaneous injection.",Nature Communications,journal,43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,11,,2020,2020-02-05 00:00:00,"Antonia E.

SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D3-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D3-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,13,,2018,2018-05-09 00:00:00,"M.

It is however, not been possible to separate the renal consequences of hyperoxaluria from that of CaOx crystal deposition. We decided to utilize ethylene glycol (EG) model where hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal deposition can be separated in time. To test our hypothesis, male rats were made hyperoxaluric by administering EG, rats were euthanized and kidneys were extracted on day 14, when occasional crystal is seen in the kidneys and day 28, when all animals have developed renal CaOx crystal deposits. Total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis and genome wide analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed to investigate differences between hyperoxaluria and crystal induced alterations in the kidneys. Immunohistochemical and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was also done for macromolecules with significant role in stone formation. All EG fed rats became hyperoxaluric by day 7, showed a few crystal deposits on day 14, and had heavy crystal deposition by day 28. There were significant changes in the expression of genes encoding for NADPH Oxidases; macromolecular crystallization modulators; genes involved in inflammasome activation; and osteogenic marker genes. Results demonstrate major differences between hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal induced changes in the kidneys. Injury and inflammation are mainly associated with crystal deposition indicating significant role played by crystal retention.",PLoS ONE,journal,0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,12,,2017,2017-11-01 00:00:00,"S.

These are benefited by the automation of many processes involved in usual students’ activities which handle massive volumes of data collected from software tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, analyzing and processing these data carefully can give us useful information about the students’ knowledge and the relationship between them and the academic tasks. This information is the source that feeds promising algorithms and methods able to predict students’ performance. In this study, almost 70 papers were analyzed to show different modern techniques widely applied for predicting students’ performance, together with the objectives they must reach in this field. These techniques and methods, which pertain to the area of Artificial Intelligence, are mainly Machine Learning, Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Neural Networks, among others.",Applied Sciences,journal,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,,2020,2020-02-04 00:00:00,"Juan L.

The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university’s strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching–learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching–learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student’s performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students.",Sustainability,journal,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,,2019,2019-05-17 00:00:00,"Diego Buenaño-Fernández, David Gil, Sergio Luján-Mora","1397315428, 2060055063, 1405522947",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c0d8c7b571530613aae37dc863b9ed34c13e95b,"Computer Science, Education, Engineering",1397315428,,100.0,35.0

More than 60–80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases can be attributed to HBV infection in high HBV prevalent regions. Although traditional Sanger sequencing has been extensively used to investigate HBV sequences, NGS is becoming more commonly used. Further, it is unknown whether word pattern frequencies of HBV reads by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used to investigate HBV genotypes and predict HCC status. In this study, we used NGS to sequence the pre-S region of the HBV sequence of 94 HCC patients and 45 chronic HBV (CHB) infected individuals. Word pattern frequencies among the sequence data of all individuals were calculated and compared using the Manhattan distance. The individuals were grouped using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Word pattern frequencies were also used to build prediction models for HCC status using both K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). We showed the extremely high power of analyzing HBV sequences using word patterns. Our key findings include that the first principal coordinate of the PCoA analysis was highly associated with the fraction of genotype B (or C) sequences and the second principal coordinate was significantly associated with the probability of having HCC. Hierarchical clustering first groups the individuals according to their major genotypes followed by their HCC status. Using cross-validation, high area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) of around 0.88 for KNN and 0.92 for SVM were obtained. In the independent data set of 46 HCC patients and 31 CHB individuals, a good AUC score of 0.77 was obtained using SVM. It was further shown that 3000 reads for each individual can yield stable prediction results for SVM. Thus, another key finding is that word patterns can be used to predict HCC status with high accuracy. Therefore, our study shows clearly that word pattern frequencies of HBV sequences contain much information about the composition of different HBV genotypes and the HCC status of an individual.",PLoS Genetics,journal,22203759-0bc9-4429-8b67-4140ab209cef,PLoS Genetics,,14,,2018,2018-02-01 00:00:00,"Xin Bai, Jian-an Jia, M.

In order to assess the relative contribution of HBV and HCV to HCC worldwide, and identify changes over time, we conducted a systematic review of case series published up to the year 2014. Eligible studies had to report seroprevalence of both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti‐HCV), alone and in combination, for at least 20 adult HCC cases. Studies using a first‐generation enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay test for HCV were excluded. A total of 119,000 HCC cases in 260 studies were included from 50 countries. Most European and American countries show a preponderance of HCV over HBV and a substantial fraction of viral marker–negative cases. Asian and African countries generally show a predominance of HBV. The fraction of HCV‐positive HCC cases is substantial in Taiwan, Mongolia, Japan, and Pakistan as well as in Western‐Central Asia and Northern Africa. No eligible studies were available in Oceania, large parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. The United States, Brazil, and Germany show evidence of higher prevalence of HCV in HCC since the year 2000. Conversely, Japan and Italy show a decline in the proportion of HCV‐positive HCC. Conclusion: HBV and HCV are predominant causes of HCC in virtually all world areas, with a growing fraction of HCC cases in several countries attributable to HCV.

7802b7394422bed8cf0515517911a0edec4aa98e,10.1002/humu.22332,Targeted Next‐Generation Sequencing can Replace Sanger Sequencing in Clinical Diagnostics,"Mutation detection through exome sequencing allows simultaneous analysis of all coding sequences of genes. However, it cannot yet replace Sanger sequencing (SS) in diagnostics because of incomplete representation and coverage of exons leading to missing clinically relevant mutations. Targeted next‐generation sequencing (NGS), in which a selected fraction of genes is sequenced, may circumvent these shortcomings. We aimed to determine whether the sensitivity and specificity of targeted NGS is equal to those of SS. We constructed a targeted enrichment kit that includes 48 genes associated with hereditary cardiomyopathies. In total, 84 individuals with cardiomyopathies were sequenced using 151 bp paired‐end reads on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The reproducibility was tested by repeating the entire procedure for five patients. The coverage of ≥30 reads per nucleotide, our major quality criterion, was 99% and in total ∼21,000 variants were identified. Confirmation with SS was performed for 168 variants (155 substitutions, 13 indels). All were confirmed, including a deletion of 18 bp and an insertion of 6 bp. The reproducibility was nearly 100%. We demonstrate that targeted NGS of a disease‐specific subset of genes is equal to the quality of SS and it can therefore be reliably implemented as a stand‐alone diagnostic test.",Human Mutation,journal,b51ebc17-99ea-48ba-9271-1074f526a9a1,Human Mutation,,34,,2013,2013-07-01 00:00:00,"B.

The etiopathogenesis of this condition is idiopathic. There are different predisposing factors in the literature which are consistent with the presented case such as lack of anterior prominence of the disc, thinning of the posterior zone of the disc and perforation of the disc. Patient Concerns: We report an uncommon temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthropathy case of a 33-year-old female patient, who presented with long-standing TMJ pain associated with limited mouth opening. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with non-reducible PDD of TMJ bilaterally. Treatment: Open surgery of TMJ (Discopexy) was the choice of treatment to release and mobilise discs. Outcomes: A noticeable increase in mouth opening without pain in TMJ area was achieved immediately after surgery and remained stable during periodic follow-ups. Take-away Lessons: The importance of magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool for arthropathy, to determine the proper management is essential. Moreover, the root of the helix inter tragus notch incision presents an advantage of open surgery of TMJ which results in immediate outcome with limited complications.",Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery,journal,1820b43c-9da0-4721-8fbf-b23cc432fd9c,Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery,81 - 84,14,,2024,2024-03-20 00:00:00,"Ahmad Gh Alkandari, K.

Sagittal MRI images of 2520 TMJs were collected from 861 men and 399 women (average age 37.33 ± 18.83 years). A deep learning algorithm with a convolutional neural network was developed. Data augmentation and the Adam optimizer were applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the deep-learning model. The prediction performances were compared between the models and human experts based on areas under the curve (AUCs). The fine-tuning model showed excellent prediction performance (AUC = 0.8775) and acceptable accuracy (approximately 77%). Comparing the AUC values of the from-scratch (0.8269) and freeze models (0.5858) showed lower performances of the other models compared to the fine-tuning model. In Grad-CAM visualizations, the fine-tuning scheme focused more on the TMJ disc when judging ADD, and the sparsity was higher than that of the from-scratch scheme (84.69% vs. 55.61%, p < 0.05). The three fine-tuned ensemble models using different data augmentation techniques showed a prediction accuracy of 83%. Moreover, the AUC values of ADD were higher when patients with TMD were divided by age (0.8549–0.9275) and sex (male: 0.8483, female: 0.9276). While the accuracy of the ensemble model was higher than that of human experts, the difference was not significant (p = 0.1987–0.0671). Learning from pre-trained weights allowed the fine-tuning model to outperform the from-scratch model. Another benefit of the fine-tuning model for diagnosing ADD of TMJ in Grad-CAM analysis was the deactivation of unwanted gradient values to provide clearer visualizations compared to the from-scratch model. The Grad-CAM visualizations also agreed with the model learned through important features in the joint disc area. The accuracy was further improved by an ensemble of three fine-tuning models using diversified data. The main benefits of this model were the higher specificity compared to human experts, which may be useful for preventing true negative cases, and the maintenance of its prediction accuracy across sexes and ages, suggesting a generalized prediction.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,,2022,2022-07-05 00:00:00,"Yeon-Hee Lee, J.

The most important subgroup of articular abnormalities in patients with temporomandibular disorders includes patients with different forms of articular disc displacement and deformation. Here, we propose a fully automated articular disc detection and segmentation system to support the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder on magnetic resonance imaging. This system uses deep learning-based semantic segmentation approaches. The study included a total of 217 magnetic resonance images from 10 patients with anterior displacement of the articular disc and 10 healthy control subjects with normal articular discs. These images were used to evaluate three deep learning-based semantic segmentation approaches: our proposed convolutional neural network encoder-decoder named 3DiscNet (Detection for Displaced articular DISC using convolutional neural NETwork), U-Net, and SegNet-Basic. Of the three algorithms, 3DiscNet and SegNet-Basic showed comparably good metrics (Dice coefficient, sensitivity, and positive predictive value). This study provides a proof-of-concept for a fully automated deep learning-based segmentation methodology for articular discs on magnetic resonance images, and obtained promising initial results, indicating that the method could potentially be used in clinical practice for the assessment of temporomandibular disorders.",Scientific Reports,journal,f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,,2022,2022-01-07 00:00:00,"S.

bbc19bdb2befdb62d7b3ad9fe81537aacf09481f,10.36897/jme/162041,The Additive-Subtractive Process Chain - a Review,"In recent years, metal additive manufacturing developed intensively and became a relevant technology in industrial production of highly complex and function integrated parts. However, almost all additively manufactured parts must be post-processed in order to fulfil geometric tolerances, surface quality demands and the desired functional properties. Thus, additive manufacturing actually means the implementation of additive-subtractive process chains. Starting with the most relevant additive processes (powder-based PBF-LB, LMD-p and wire-based WAAM and LMD-w/WLAM), considering intermediate process steps (heat treatment and shot peening) and ending up with post-processing material removal processes (with defined and undefined cutting edges), this paper gives an overview of recent research findings with respect to a comprehensive scientific investigation of influences and interactions within the additive-subtractive process chain. This includes both the macroscopic geometric scale and the microscopic scale of the material structure. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives are derived and discussed.",Journal of Machine Engineering,journal,8068ee41-f787-4bcf-a76e-d145c91d484e,Journal of Machine Engineering,,,,2023,2023-03-15 00:00:00,"H.

Mathematical methods are employed to formulate and examine the three models under study. Since the paper is theoretical, it does not use any empirical data although numerical illustrations are provided whenever they are appropriate.FindingsThe Harrod-Domar model explains why countries with high rates of saving may also enjoy high rate of economic growth. Both the Solow and Ramsey models can be used to explain the medium-income trap. The paper examines the impact of Covid shocks on the macroeconomy. While the growth rate can be recovered, it may not always possible to recover the output level.Research limitations/implicationsFor the Harrod-Domar model, the public spending decreases the private consumption at the period 1, but there is no change in the capital stock and hence the production in subsequent periods. For the Ramsey model with AK production function, both the private consumption and the outputs will be lowered. In both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function, if the debt is not high and the interest rate is sufficiently low, it is better to use public debt for production rather than for consumption. If the country borrows to recover the Total Factor Productivity after the Covid pandemic, both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function show that the rate of growth is higher for the year just after the pandemic but is the same as before the pandemic.Practical implicationsThe economy can recover the growth rate after a Covid shock, but the recovery process will generally take many periods.Social implicationsThis paper focuses on economic implications and does not aim to examine social implications of policy changes or Covid-type shock.Originality/valueThe paper provides a comparison of three basic growth models with respect to public spending, public debts and repayments and Covid-type shocks.",Fulbright Review of Economics and Policy,journal,f076d2d5-bb99-45f6-a4e0-fa5811fc41f3,Fulbright Review of Economics and Policy,,,,2023,2023-10-10 00:00:00,"C.

This article highlights some recent advances that have had an impact on patient management or could do so in the near future. Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, particularly the epithelioid subtype, is amenable to radical therapy in selected cases, and factors such as ki67 proliferation index, expression of BAP1 and mutation in CDKN2A show promise as prognostic indicators. Our understanding of multicystic mesothelioma has improved in recent years; it is a true neoplasm for which surgery may be indicated. Serous carcinomas involving the peritoneum are now known to originate from tubal epithelium. They are of two distinct types, high grade and low grade, which are now recognized as different neoplasms with distinctive features, oncogenesis and behavior. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is an unusual condition that usually arises from an appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Recent consensus in the classification and nomenclature of these lesions is discussed, including the distinction between low grade and high grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (HAMN), and the diagnostic criteria for appendiceal adenocarcinoma. PMP is divided into four prognostic groups: acellular mucin, low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, and high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei with signet ring cells. The pseudomyxoma microbiome is a promising area for clinical intervention but has been the subject of little research activity. Goblet cell adenocarcinoma (previously known as 'goblet cell carcinoid') is a distinctive type of appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Its behavior correlates with histologic features, but no general consensus for classification has been reached.",Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology,journal,61f95257-b067-4f34-bfbd-1381d38d0dea,Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,"

The common goal of these techniques is to forecast the behaviour of the market, which can be translated into various classification tasks, such as, for instance, predicting the likelihood of companies’ bankruptcy or in fraud detection systems. However, it is often the case that real-world financial data are unbalanced, meaning that the classes’ distribution is not equally represented in such datasets. This gives the main issue since any Machine Learning model is trained according to the majority class mainly, leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we explore different data augmentation techniques to deal with very unbalanced financial data. We consider a number of publicly available datasets, then apply state-of-the-art augmentation strategies to them, and finally evaluate the results for several Machine Learning models trained on the sampled data. The performance of the various approaches is evaluated according to their accuracy, micro, and macro F1 score, and finally by analyzing the precision and recall over the minority class. We show that a consistent and accurate improvement is achieved when data augmentation is employed. The obtained classification results look promising and indicate the efficiency of augmentation strategies on financial tasks. On the basis of these results, we present an approach focused on classification tasks within the financial domain that takes a dataset as input, identifies what kind of augmentation technique to use, and then applies an ensemble of all the augmentation techniques of the identified type to the input dataset along with an ensemble of different methods to tackle the underlying classification.",EPJ Data Science,journal,aa12af37-66cf-4a5d-9368-18b04d86d37f,EPJ Data Science,1-31,12,,2023,2023-07-10 00:00:00,"Golshid Ranjbaran, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Gianfranco Lombardo, S.

Then, monitoring the company's financial situation and predicting its future development becomes important. Assessing the financial health of business entities using various models is an important area in not only scientific research, but also business practice.
Purpose of the article: This study aims to predict the bankruptcy of companies in the engineering and automotive industries of the Slovak Republic using a multilayer neural network and logistic regression. Importantly, we develop a novel an early warning model for the Slovak engineering and automotive industries, which can be applied in countries with undeveloped capital markets.
Methods: Data on the financial ratios of 2,384 companies were used. We used a logistic regression to analyse the data for the year 2019 and designed a logistic model. Meanwhile, the data for the years 2018 and 2019 were analysed using the neural network. In the prediction model, we analysed the predictive performance of several combinations of factors based on the industry sector, use of the scaling technique, activation function, and ratio of the sample distribution to the test and training parts.
Findings & value added: The financial indicators ROS, QR, NWC/A, and PC/S reduce the likelihood of bankruptcy. Regarding the value of this work, we constructed an optimal network for the automotive and engineering industries using nine financial indicators on the input layer in combination with one hidden layer. Moreover, we developed a novel prediction model for bankruptcy using six of these indicators. Almost all sampled industries are privatised, and most companies are foreign owned. Hence, international companies as well as researchers can apply our models to understand their financial health and sustainability. Moreover, they can conduct comparative analyses of their own model with ours to reveal areas of model improvements.",Oeconomia Copernicana,journal,2ed73a2b-7062-476d-bcf1-7462df506711,Oeconomia Copernicana,,,,2022,2022-12-30 00:00:00,"B.

In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.",Frontiers in Psychology,journal,89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06,Frontiers in Psychology,,11,,2020,2020-10-19 00:00:00,"Hui Luan, P.

We evaluated four constructed response assessment items for undergraduate physiology, each targeting five levels of a developing flux learning progression in an ion context. Human-coded datasets were used to train two ML models: (i) an 8-classification algorithm ensemble implemented in the Constructed Response Classifier (CRC), and (ii) a single classification algorithm implemented in LightSide Researcher’s Workbench. Human coding agreement on approximately 700 student responses per item was high for both approaches with Cohen’s kappas ranging from 0.75 to 0.87 on holistic scoring and from 0.78 to 0.89 on analytic composite scoring. ML model performance varied across items and rubric type. For two items, training sets from both coding approaches produced similarly accurate ML models, with differences in Cohen’s kappa between machine and human scores of 0.002 and 0.041. For the other items, ML models trained with analytic coded responses and used for a composite score, achieved better performance as compared to using holistic scores for training, with increases in Cohen’s kappa of 0.043 and 0.117. These items used a more complex scenario involving movement of two ions. It may be that analytic coding is beneficial to unpacking this additional complexity.",Journal of Science Education and Technology,journal,99823631-94f9-424f-8c7d-e45af666d6b0,Journal of Science Education and Technology,150 - 167,30,,2020,2020-09-26 00:00:00,"Lauren N.

Particularly in ecological reserves, competition among various types of land use restricts the coordinated development of PLE space. To explore spatial sustainable development, this study starts from a PLE spatial perspective, based on Landsat long time series images. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) and landscape index analysis were selected to monitor the spatial and temporal land use and landscape pattern changes in the Poyang Lake region (PYL region) from 1989 to 2020. The RF-Markov-FLUS coupled model was used to simulate spatial changes in 2030 under four scenarios: production space priority (PSP), living space priority (LSP), ecological space priority (ESP), and an integrated development (ID). Finally, the goal-problem-principle was used to enhance PLE space. The results showed that: (1) production space and ecological spaces decreased in general from 1989 to 2020 by 3% and 7%, respectively; living space increased by 11%. (2) From 1989 to 2020, the overall landscape spread in the Poyang Lake (PYL) area decreased, connectivity decreased, fragmentation increased, landscape heterogeneity increased, and landscape geometry became more irregular. (3) Compared with the other three scenarios, the ID scenario maintained steady production space growth in 2030, the expansion rate of living space slowed, and the area of ecological space decreased the least. (4) Spatial pattern optimization should start with three aspects: the transformation of the agricultural industry, improving the efficiency of urban land use, and establishing communities of “mountains, water, forests, fields, lakes and grasses”. The results provide scientific planning and suggestions for the future ecological protection of Poyang Lake area with multiple scenarios and perspectives.",Remote Sensing,journal,8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

There are numerous seasonal lakes in the Poyang Lake region, and these lakes create a complex and diverse wetland landscape and serve as the main activity area for migratory birds. Seasonal lakes have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes, but research on seasonal lakes is relatively limited. Based on long-term remote sensing images, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of seasonal lakes and their influencing factors and ecological effects. The conclusions were as follows: the average water area of seasonal lakes showed a unimodal change during the year, reaching a maximum in July and a minimum in January. The interannual water area fluctuated greatly, and the overall water area showed a small downward trend. In terms of spatial variation, the seasonal lakes were connected with the main lake in the wet season and separated from the main lake in the dry season. Among the natural factors, the influences of temperature, evaporation, and rainfall on the water area of the seasonal lakes were successively reduced. In addition, the incoming water from the Yangtze River had an important influence. Among the human factors, the traditional fishing method “enclosing sublakes in autumn” had the greatest impact on the water area in a specific period, followed by the indirect impact of the Three Gorges Project.",Water,journal,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,1539,13,,2021,2021-05-30 00:00:00,"Hai Liu, H.

This paper analyzes changes in cultivated land, the driving factors that cause them, and their tremendous impact on landscape pattern changes in the Dongting Lake Basin. For this purpose, we used mathematical statistics, buffer analysis, trend analysis, landscape pattern index, and logistic regression model to analyze the land use data of the study area from 1980 to 2018. The results show that the cultivated land showed a decreasing trend, with the total area decreased by 4.76% (or 716.13 km2) from 1980 to 2018, and the activity of mutual transformation with other land use types decreased. The spatial distribution pattern of cultivated land and landscape shows the change characteristics gradually from Dongting Lake to the surroundings. Among the driving factors of cultivated land changes, the influence of human activities was gradually increasing, while the natural factors were decreasing. The cultivated land landscape pattern index and the overall landscape pattern index have a significant positive correlation, showing relatively consistent change trend and spatial distribution characteristics. We believe that the decrease of cultivated land area has a certain relationship with the increase of landscape fragmentation in the Dongting Lake Basin.

To evaluate the evolution of habitat quality and its influencing factors in the area, we used Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to interpret the land-use status and used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to analyze the characteristics of changes in habitat quality in the Poyang Lake Eco-Economic Zone (PLEEZ) from 1988 to 2018. The results show that, from 1988 to 2018, land use in the PLEEZ underwent significant changes. The changes in land use led to a gradual increase in habitat degradation and a gradual decrease in habitat quality in the study area. Rapid urbanization notably decreased the habitat quality in the study area. However, at the same time, the ecological protection projects such as returning farmland to forests slowed the decline in habitat quality. Driven by these two factors, habitat quality in the PLEEZ gradually declined but the rate of its decline was suppressed.

However, the clinical relevance of glycosylation-related genes (GRGs) in uveal melanoma (UM) is yet to be fully understood. This study aimed to shed light on the impact of GRGs on UM prognosis. Methods To identify the most influential genes in UM, we employed the AUCell and WGCNA algorithms. The GRGs signature was established by integrating bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. UM patients were separated into two groups based on their risk scores, the GCNS_low and GCNS_high groups, and the differences in clinicopathological correlation, functional enrichment, immune response, mutational burden, and immunotherapy between the two groups were examined. The role of the critical gene AUP1 in UM was validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The GRGs signature was comprised of AUP1, HNMT, PARP8, ARC, ALG5, AKAP13, and ISG20. The GCNS was a significant prognostic factor for UM, and high GCNS correlated with poorer outcomes. Patients with high GCNS displayed heightened immune-related characteristics, such as immune cell infiltration and immune scores. In vitro experiments showed that the knockdown of AUP1 led to a drastic reduction in the viability, proliferation, and invasion capability of UM cells. Conclusion Our gene signature provides an independent predictor of UM patient survival and represents a starting point for further investigation of GRGs in UM. It offers a novel perspective on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of UM.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,journal,baea33cc-0a71-4b2a-9f01-5071f7b1abc9,Frontiers in Endocrinology,,14,,2023,2023-03-23 00:00:00,"Jianlan Liu, Pengpeng Zhang, Fang-mei Yang, Keyu Jiang, Shiyi Sun, Zhijia Xia, G.

Circadian rhythm alterations in tumourigenesis are of equal importance to genetic factors and several biologic clock genes are considered to be prognostic biomarkers for various cancers. The aim of this study was to establish reliable markers based on biologic clock genes, thus providing a new perspective for assessing immunotherapy response and prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Methods We used 502 HNSCC samples and 44 normal samples from the TCGA-HNSCC dataset as the training set. 97 samples from GSE41613 were used as an external validation set. Prognostic characteristics of circadian rhythm-related genes (CRRGs) were established by Lasso, random forest and stepwise multifactorial Cox. Multivariate analysis revealed that CRRGs characteristics were independent predictors of HNSCC, with patients in the high-risk group having a worse prognosis than those in the low-risk group. The relevance of CRRGs to the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy was assessed by an integrated algorithm. Results 6-CRRGs were considered to be strongly associated with HNSCC prognosis and a good predictor of HNSCC. The riskscore established by the 6-CRRG was found to be an independent prognostic factor for HNSCC in multifactorial analysis, with patients in the low-risk group having a higher overall survival (OS) than the high-risk group. Nomogram prediction maps constructed from clinical characteristics and riskscore had good prognostic power. Patients in the low-risk group had higher levels of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint expression and were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusion 6-CRRGs play a key predictive role for the prognosis of HNSCC patients and can guide physicians in selecting potential responders to prioritise immunotherapy, which could facilitate further research in precision immuno-oncology.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,14,,2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,"Hao Chi, Jinyan Yang, Gaoge Peng, Jinhao Zhang, Guobin Song, Xixi Xie, Zhijia Xia, Jinhui Liu, Gang Tian","2056175119, 2000447626, 2181790063, 2117980663, 2072632648, 2242086213, 103297759, 2108412351, 2146933862",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a219d3fa9537f2c44ef9735cc00f4bbede0d71b8,Medicine,2056175119,['JournalArticle'],55.0,87.0

Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.",Energies,journal,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,,2022,2022-08-28 00:00:00,"D.

We show theoretically that robots may reduce employment and wages and that their local impacts can be estimated using variation in exposure to robots—defined from industry-level advances in robotics and local industry employment. We estimate robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. We also show that areas most exposed to robots after 1990 do not exhibit any differential trends before then, and robots’ impact is distinct from other capital and technologies. One more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2 percentage points and wages by 0.42%.",Journal of Political Economy,journal,f55d084f-66df-4f19-8cd9-dfeeb5d64fd9,Journal of Political Economy,2188 - 2244,128,,2017,2017-03-01 00:00:00,"Daron Acemoglu, P.

Although the UAE University has a well-established Banner Registration System, however, course planning performed by the faculty and staff at department and college level sometimes is short of required expertise and qualification. Students have faced problems due to lack of a proper advising system as well as an inadequacy of seeking proper advice. An EE Course Planning Software System (EE-CPSS) package is devised in this respect. The software is developed by using the Python computer programming language. This system helps students in selecting from four to seven most suitable courses to register in the next semester. The outcome of the course selection is stored in a file for future reference.",Journal of Software,journal,73585779-8f95-43d4-be17-c74ed16aebd9,J. Softw.,219-231,13,,2018,2018-04-01 00:00:00,M.

However, given the complexity of learning analytics (LA) systems, it can be challenging to meaningfully involve non-technical stakeholders throughout their design and development. This article reports on the iterative co-design, development, and classroom evaluation of Konscia, a wearable, real-time awareness tool for teachers working in AI-enhanced K-12 classrooms. In the process, we argue that the co-design of LA systems requires new kinds of prototyping methods. We introduce one of our own prototyping methods, REs, to address unique challenges of co-prototyping LA tools. This work presents the first end-to-end demonstration of how non-technical stakeholders can participate throughout the whole design process for a complex LA system—from early generative phases to the selection and tuning of analytics to evaluation in real-world contexts. We conclude by providing methodological recommendations for future LA co-design efforts.

The purpose of this paper is to present a decade of experience with analyzing and improving an online practice environment for math, which has thus far recorded over a billion responses. We present the methods we use to both steer and analyze this system in real-time, using scoring rules on accuracy and response times, a tailored rating system to provide both learners and items with current ability and difficulty ratings, and an adaptive engine that matches learners to items. Moreover, we explore the quality of fit by means of prediction accuracy and parallel item reliability. Limitations and pitfalls are discussed by diagnosing sources of misfit, like violations of unidimensionality and unforeseen dynamics. Finally, directions for development are discussed, including embedded learning analytics and a focus on online experimentation to evaluate both the system itself and the users’ learning gains. Though many challenges remain open, we believe that large steps have been made in providing methods to efficiently manage and research educational big data from a massive online learning system.",Journal of Learning Analytics,journal,1355ccee-1cfd-459c-8df4-bc82e5f741da,J.
