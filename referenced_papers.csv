In this work, we developed simulation models for different EV charging scenarios in the home sector. We used them to predict maximum demand based on the increasing penetration of EV consumers. We comprehensively reviewed the literature on EV charging technologies, battery capacity, charging situations, and the impact of EV loads. Our results suggest a method for visualizing the impact of EV charging loads by considering factors such as state of charge, arrival time, charging duration, rate of charge, maximum charging power, and involvement rate. This method can be used to model load profiles and determine the number of chargers needed to meet EV user demand. We also explored the use of a time-of-use (TOU) tariff as a demand response strategy, which encourages EV owners to charge their vehicles off-peak in order to avoid higher demand charges. Our simulation results show the effects of various charging conditions on load profiles and indicate that the current TOU price strategy can accommodate a 20% growth in EV consumers, while the alternative TOU price strategy can handle up to a 30% penetration level.",Energies,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2023,2023-04-20 00:00:00,13,36,"Pramote Jaruwatanachai, Yod Sukamongkol, T.

Previous studies have sought to identify the various factors influencing EV charging patterns to deploy an appropriate charging infrastructure. However, limited attention has been paid to the investigation of different charging patterns identified in different regions at different phases of the EV program. This study aims to fill this research gap in the literature by developing binary logistic models that account for the factors influencing charging demands in different regions of Korea, i.e., Jeju-do and Gangneung-si. To this end, we collected historical data on EV charging transactions in these study regions and analyzed them to evaluate the difference in charging demands. The developed models suggest that the charging demand varies with charger characteristics and charging time. Moreover, different charging patterns in different regions can be explained by the different travel behaviors of those who use EVs for different trip purposes. These findings provide an important implication suggesting that policymakers should consider a stepwise strategy to construct charging infrastructure at the appropriate scale and configuration, depending on the phase of the EV program.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-15 00:00:00,6,25,"Dae-yun Kim, Doyun Kwon, Jihoon Han, S.

This study identifies user behavioral patterns by analyzing data from more than 7000 charging stations in Canada, comparing residential vs. public Level 2, and public direct current fast (DCFC) vs. public Level 2 charging. A novel algorithm, CHAODA, was applied to identify differences between DCFC and other Level 2 charging options. Through a multivariate and holistic methodology, various patterns emerge, identifying differences in the utilization and seasonality of different EVSE types. The study provides evidence of an “EV Duck Curve” that amplifies the baseline of the power production “Duck Curve,” confirming future challenges for grid stability. Implementations of this study can support future EVSE infrastructure planning efforts and help improve the overall service of electric vehicle supply equipment and grid stability.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2023,2023-02-05 00:00:00,34,49,"T.

While various governments promote EVs, people feel “range anxiety” because of their limited driving range or charge capacity. A limited number of charging stations are available, which results in a strong demand for predicting energy consumed by EVs. In this paper, machine learning (ML) models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to investigate the total energy consumption (TEC) by the EVs. The independent variables used for the study include changing real-life situations or external parameters, such as trip distance, tire type, driving style, power, odometer reading, EV model, city, motorway, country roads, air conditioning, and park heating. We compared the ML models’ performance along with the error analysis. A pairwise correlation study showed that trip distance has a high correlation coefficient (0.87) with TEC. XGBoost had better prediction accuracy (~92%) or R2 (0.92). Trip distance, power, heating, and odometer reading were the most important features influencing the TEC, identified using the shapley additive explanations method.",World Electric Vehicle Journal,journal,,6fc2b7b5-0526-4df5-b942-b1b93f3cf248,World Electric Vehicle Journal,,,N/A,2021,2021-06-29 00:00:00,28,24,"Sugam Pokharel, Pradip Sah, Deepak Ganta","2128916182, 2129350920, 1621181211",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bf43099563822c04eb58e6ac7c745680eafcbe7,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science, Mathematics",2128916182

One of the most challenging problems in cloud computing is detecting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The attack detection framework for the DDoS attack is tricky because of its nonlinear nature of interruption activities, atypical system traffic behaviour, and many features in the problem space. As a result, creating defensive solutions against these attacks is critical for mainstream cloud computing adoption. In this novel research, by using performance parameters, perplexed-based classifiers with and without feature selection will be compared with the existing machine learning algorithms such as naïve Bayes and random forest to prove the efficacy of the perplexed-based classification algorithm. Comparing the performance parameters like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, the proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 99%, which is higher than the existing algorithms, proving that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in detecting the DDoS attacks in cloud computing systems. To extend our research in the area of nature-inspired computing, we compared our perplexed Bayes classifier feature selection with nature-inspired feature selection like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and found that our classifier is highly efficient in comparison with GA and PSO and their accuracies are 2% and 8%, respectively, less than those of perplexed Bayes classifier.",Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],f32b7322-b69c-4e63-801d-8f50784ef778,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,2022,N/A,2022,2022-07-19 00:00:00,17,41,"N.

We introduce an uncertainty‐controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA) based on ensemble machine learning predictions from different molecular representations that concurrently optimizes excited state energies, synthesizability, and exciton size for the discovery of singlet fission materials. The ucGA allows us to efficiently explore the chemical space spanned by the reFORMED fragment database, which consists of 45,000 cores and 5,000 substituents derived from crystallographic structures assembled in the FORMED repository. Running the ucGA in an exploitative setup performs local optimization on variations of known singlet fission scaffolds, such as acenes. In an explorative mode, hitherto unknown candidates displaying excellent excited state properties for singlet fission are generated. We suggest a class of heteroatom‐rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge‐transfer mediated singlet fission.

Inspired by nonequilibrium statistical physics, these models can generate 3D molecular structures with specific properties or requirements crucial to drug discovery. Diffusion models were particularly successful at learning the complex probability distributions of 3D molecular geometries and their corresponding chemical and physical properties through forward and reverse diffusion processes. This review focuses on the technical implementation of diffusion models tailored for 3D molecular generation. It compares the performance, evaluation methods, and implementation details of various diffusion models used for molecular generation tasks. We cover strategies for atom and bond representation, architectures of reverse diffusion denoising networks, and challenges associated with generating stable 3D molecular structures.

Implemented algorithms include automated procedures for conformational sampling, explicit solvation studies, the calculation of absolute molecular entropy, and the identification of molecular protonation and deprotonation sites. Calculations are set up to run concurrently, providing efficient single-node parallelization. CREST is designed to require minimal user input and comes with an implementation of the GFNn-xTB Hamiltonians and the GFN-FF force-field. Furthermore, interfaces to any quantum chemistry and force-field software can easily be created. In this article, we present recent developments in the CREST code and show a selection of applications for the most important features of the program.

Previous shallow learning and deep learning strategies adopt the single learning model approach for intrusion detection. The single learning model approach may experience problems to understand increasingly complicated data distribution of intrusion patterns. Particularly, the single deep learning model may not be effective to capture unique patterns from intrusive attacks having a small number of samples. In order to further enhance the performance of machine learning based IDS, we propose the Big Data based Hierarchical Deep Learning System (BDHDLS). BDHDLS utilizes behavioral features and content features to understand both network traffic characteristics and information stored in the payload. Each deep learning model in the BDHDLS concentrates its efforts to learn the unique data distribution in one cluster. This strategy can increase the detection rate of intrusive attacks as compared to the previous single learning model approaches. Based on parallel training strategy and big data techniques, the model construction time of BDHDLS is reduced substantially when multiple machines are deployed.",Big Data Mining and Analytics,journal,['JournalArticle'],fa31ff53-6717-46c5-934d-9f21c27f96ba,Big Data Min.

In this paper, we explore how to model an intrusion detection system based on deep learning, and we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS). Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the performance of the proposed model. We compare it with those of J48, artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and other machine learning methods proposed by previous researchers on the benchmark data set. The experimental results show that RNN-IDS is very suitable for modeling a classification model with high accuracy and that its performance is superior to that of traditional machine learning classification methods in both binary and multiclass classification. The RNN-IDS model improves the accuracy of the intrusion detection and provides a new research method for intrusion detection.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,21954-21961,5,N/A,2017,2017-10-12 00:00:00,1304,27,"Chuanlong Yin, Yuefei Zhu, Jin-long Fei, Xin-Zheng He","30796665, 1733625, 2191560, 50046030",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ef9ae1ce8c91ce671a211bdda792bf3752d1522,"Computer Science, Engineering",30796665

However, students often get distracted because of various reasons, which affect their learning capacity to a great extent. Many researchers have been trying to improve the quality of online education, but we need a holistic approach to address this issue. This paper intends to provide a mechanism that uses the camera feed and microphone input to monitor the real-time attention level of students during online classes. We explore various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms throughout this study. We propose a system that uses five distinct non-verbal features to calculate the attention score of the student during computer-based tasks and generate real-time feedback for both students and the organization. We can use the generated feedback as a heuristic value to analyze the overall performance of students as well as the teaching standards of the lecturers.",2020 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC),Unknown,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",Unknown,2020 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC),1-4,,Unknown,2020,2020-10-09 00:00:00,12,14,"Rahul Rk, Shanthakumar S, Vykunth P, Sairamnath K","2265547870, 2265585930, 2265542141, 2265542874",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e0dd6713c90ba4cbf518eb99130754c1090f5b2,"Computer Science, Education",2265547870

However, despite the number of publications related to LbL assembly, predicting LbL coating properties represents quite a challenge, can take a long time, and be very costly. Machine learning (ML) methodologies that are now emerging can accelerate and improve new coating development and potentially revolutionize the field. Recently, we have demonstrated a preliminary ML-based model for coating thickness prediction. In this paper, we compared several ML algorithms for optimizing a methodology for coating thickness prediction, namely, linear regression, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Extra Tree Regressor. The current research has shown that learning algorithms are effective in predicting the coating output value, with the Extra Tree Regressor algorithm demonstrating superior predictive performance, when used in combination with optimized hyperparameters and with missing data imputation. The best predictors of the coating thickness were determined, and they can be later used to accurately predict coating thickness, avoiding measurement of multiple parameters. The development of optimized methodologies will ensure different reliable predictive models for coating property/function relations. As a continuation, the methodology can be adapted and used for predicting the outputs connected to antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties in order to be able to respond to actual biomedical problems such as antibiotic resistance, implant rejection, or COVID-19 outbreak.",ACS Omega,,['JournalArticle'],d516f81c-009b-445d-b748-c827efa137d3,ACS Omega,4677 - 4686,8,Unknown,2023,2023-01-29 00:00:00,10,26,"T.

In this context, new implant materials and coatings that deal with medical device-associated complications are required. Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory materials are also required for wound healing applications, especially in diabetic patients with chronic wounds. In this work, we present hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels with triple activity: antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and miRNA delivery agent. We demonstrate that polyarginine with a degree of polymerization of 30 (PAR30), which was previously shown to have a prolonged antibacterial activity, decreases inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated macrophages. In addition, PAR30 accelerated fibroblast migration in macrophage/fibroblast co-culture system, suggesting a positive effect on wound healing. Furthermore, PAR30 allowed to load miRNA into HA hydrogels, and then to deliver them into the cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first describing miRNA-loaded hydrogels with antibacterial effect and anti-inflammatory features. Such system can become a tool for the treatment of infected wounds, e.g. diabetic ulcers, as well as for foreign body response modulation. This article is protected by copyright.

The study aims to clarify the macrophage heterogeneity and phenotype dynamics, and pinpoint critical targets within efferocytosis in DKD. Methods Utilizing early human DKD sequencing data, we computed the potential communication between leukocytes and renal intrinsic cells. Subsequently, we scrutinized the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from CD45-enriched immune cells, concentrating on the macrophage subsets in DKD. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was conducted to explore cell development. Differential expression genes (DEGs) from macrophage subgroups and bulk RNA-sequencing were used to identify shared hub genes. The NephroseqV5 platform was employed to evaluate the clinical significance, and the expression of key molecules was validated in DKD tissues. Results Macrophage infiltration rose in DKD, causing inflammation through the release of chemokines. As time progressed, the number of resident macrophages substantially dropped, with diminishing M1-like and increasing M2-like phenotypes relative to early stages. Further analysis pointed to the most enrichment of macrophage function is the phagosome. We overlapped the DEGs with efferocytosis-related genes and identified key genes, including CD36, ITGAM, and CX3CR1, which exhibited significant correlations with macrophages and T cells. The Nephroseq database revealed that they are associated with proteinuria and renal function. Consistent with the validation set, in vivo experiments verified elevated expression levels of key molecules. Conclusions In essence, our research elucidated the dynamics in macrophage subtype transitions. It emphasized three pivotal genes as critical modulators of macrophage efferocytosis in DKD, indicating their potential as innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,16,N/A,2025,2025-02-19 00:00:00,1,54,"Binshan Zhang, Yunqi Wu, Zhongli Wang, Suhua Gao, Hongyan Liu, Yao Lin, Pei Yu","2334735633, 2306834116, 2334581284, 2339422376, 2115669246, 2149202194, 2271660714",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61e5330e744545c8b4c92f51c818223acaa277df,"Biology, Medicine",2334735633

Using a combination of bioinformatics and biological assays, this study conducted an in-depth investigation of the effects of 34. The results of this study have substantial implications for cancer research and treatment. 34 has shown remarkable efficacy in inhibiting the growth of several cancer cell lines, including those representing prostate carcinoma (PC3) and cervical carcinoma (HeLa). The high sensitivity of these cells, indicated by low IC50 values, underscores its potential as a promising chemotherapeutic agent. In addition, 34 has revealed the ability to induce cell cycle arrest, particularly in the G2/M phase, a phenomenon with critical implications for tumor initiation and growth. By interfering with DNA replication in cancer cells, 34 has shown the capacity to trigger cell death, offering a new avenue for cancer treatment. In addition, computational analyses have identified key genes affected by 34 treatment, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. These genes are involved in critical biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication and microtubule dynamics, all of which are central to cancer development and progression.

To facilitate data acquisition and analysis the contrast-enhanced perfusion is often omitted resulting in a biparametric prostate MRI protocol. The intention of this review is to analyze the current value of biparametric prostate MRI in combination with methods of machine-learning and deep learning in the detection, grading, and characterization of prostate cancer; if available a direct comparison with human radiologist performance was performed. PubMed was systematically queried and 29 appropriate studies were identified and retrieved. The data show that detection of clinically significant prostate cancer and differentiation of prostate cancer from non-cancerous tissue using machine-learning and deep learning is feasible with promising results.

Material and methods We used two publicly available datasets of postero-anterior chest radiographs, which are from Montgomery County, Maryland, and Shenzhen, China. A CNN (ConvNet) from scratch was trained to automatically detect TB on chest radiographs. Also, a CNN-based transfer learning approach using five different pre-trained models, including Inception_v3, Xception, ResNet50, VGG19, and VGG16 was utilized for classifying TB and normal cases from CXR images. The performance of models for testing datasets was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, precision, area under curve (AUC), and F1-score. Results All proposed models provided an acceptable accuracy for two-class classification. Our proposed CNN architecture (i.e., ConvNet) achieved 88.0% precision, 87.0% sensitivity, 87.0% F1-score, 87.0% accuracy, and AUC of 87.0%, which was slightly less than the pre-trained models. Among all models, Exception, ResNet50, and VGG16 provided the highest classification performance of automated TB classification with precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and AUC of 91.0%, and 90.0% accuracy. Conclusions Our study presents a transfer learning approach with deep CNNs to automatically classify TB and normal cases from the chest radiographs. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score for the detection of TB were found to be more than 87.0% for all models used in the study.

Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized‐stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized‐stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3‐year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment.

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Public sector employees. Participants 3550 participants of the Finnish Retirement and Aging study. Primary and secondary outcome measures Participants estimated on a yearly questionnaire their weekly hours of different types of activities converted to metabolic equivalent of task-hour/week. Self-rated health was assessed on a 5-point Likert-like scale from poor to excellent and dichotomised as suboptimal and optimal. Multivariate trajectory analysis was used to distinguish different subgroups of trajectories. Multinomial regression analysis was used to describe the associations between covariates and the probability of being classified to a certain trajectory group. Results Three trajectory groups were identified, all displaying increasing activity during retirement with a simultaneous decrease in perceived suboptimal health. Physical activity peaked at 18 months after retirement and then slightly decreased, except for initially highly physically active participants (9%) with good self-rated health, who demonstrated a constant high level of physical activity. Male gender, professional occupation, being married or cohabiting, body mass index <30 kg/m2, not smoking and using alcohol below risk levels were associated with higher physical activity and better self-rated health. Conclusion Changes in physical activity and perceived health during retirement transition were interconnected. Both were improved during retirement transition, but the change was temporary.

Given the country’s aging population and recent liberalization of the two-child policy, understanding the effects of intergenerational caregiving on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals is crucial. This study aimed to explore the impact of intergenerational caregiving on mental health among middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals. Methods We analyzed data from the China Health and Aging Tracking Survey (CHARLS) 2013, consisting of 6602 participants finally. Personal information, family structure, financial support, health status, and physical measurements were selected for analysis. Correlation and regression analyses were used for relationships among variables controlling for potential confounding variables. Mental health status was evaluated using the depression self-rating scale. Results There is a significant positive effect of intergenerational care on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) people. Additionally, we re-profiled intergenerational care variables by considering the number and length of intergenerational caregivers, and found that the effects remained significant. Furthermore, the effects of intergenerational care vary across subgroups based on gender, age, nature of usual residence, marital status, and physical health status. Finally, we identified two mechanisms through which intergenerational caregiving positively affects mental health: intergenerational financial support and intergenerational spiritual support.

However, these associations have not been explored using procedures that analyze the sequential effects between risk factors of falling. The present study aimed to examine the effects of muscle strength, agility, and fear of falling on risk of falling using path analysis in community-dwelling older adults. In total, 49 elderly (female = 33, male = 16) participants aged between 65 and 76 years (M = 68.38 years; SD = 6.22) were included for analysis. Muscle strength, agility, fear of falling, and risk of falling were assessed using validated instruments for the older adult population. The proposed model shows that muscle strength was negatively associated with agility. Consequently, agility was negatively associated with fear of falling. The same trend appeared between fear of falling and risk of falling. The effect sizes were between small and medium for agility (R2 = 0.16), fear of falling, (R2 = 0.29), and risk of falling (R2 = 0.03). The main finding of the present study was that muscle strength was significantly correlated with agility, which, in turn, predicted fear of falling. Consequently, lower scores for fear of falling explained lower risk of falling in community-dwelling older adults. While muscle strength is a crucial component of physical fitness, only with adequate levels of agility can older adults possess the efficacy and ability to perform daily tasks.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,20,N/A,2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,20,38,"Filipe Rodrigues, A.

Objective To ascertain the state of the science on social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions to improve all-hazard household disaster preparedness. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Databases, trial registers, reports, and websites were searched, and citation trails followed utilizing replicable methods. Individual, cluster, and cross-over randomized controlled trials of non-institutionalized, community-dwelling populations and non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after, and program evaluation studies were included. At least two review authors independently screened each potentially relevant study for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane’s RoB2 tool for randomized studies and ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies. Meta-analyses were applied using a random-effects model. Where meta-analysis was not indicated, results were synthesized using summary statistics of intervention effect estimates and vote counting based on effect direction. The evidence was rated using GRADE. Results 17 studies were included with substantial methodological and clinical diversity. No intervention effect was observed for preparedness supplies (OR = 6.12, 95% 0.13 to 284.37) or knowledge (SMD = 0.96, 95% CI −0.15 to 2.08) outcomes. A small positive effect (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91) was observed for preparedness behaviors, with very low certainty of evidence. No studies reported adverse effects from the interventions. Conclusion Research designs elucidating the efficacy of practical yet complex and multi- faceted social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions present substantial methodological challenges where rigorous study design elements may not match the contextual public health priority needs and resources where interventions were delivered. While the overall strength of the evidence was evaluated as low to very low, we acknowledge the valuable and informative work of the included studies. The research represents the seminal work in this field and provides an important foundation for the state of the science of household emergency preparedness intervention effectiveness and efficacy. The findings are relevant to disaster preparedness practice and research, and we encourage researchers to continue this line of research, using these studies and this review to inform ongoing improvements in study designs.",Frontiers in Public Health,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",d3dd5449-daa1-4d57-9412-9add6037584f,Frontiers in Public Health,,11,N/A,2024,2024-02-23 00:00:00,4,85,"Taryn Amberson, Tara N Heagele, Tamar Wyte-Lake, M.

b78073ac3295e86de880eae152546fb3811283c0,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae197,DrivR-Base: a feature extraction toolkit for variant effect prediction model construction,"Motivation Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of numerous variants in the human genome. However, understanding their precise roles in diseases remains challenging due to their complex functional mechanisms. Various methodologies have emerged to predict the pathogenic significance of these genetic variants. Typically, these methods employ an integrative approach, leveraging diverse data sources that provide critical insights into genomic function. Despite the abundance of publicly available data sources and databases, the process of navigating, extracting, and pre-processing features for machine learning models can be daunting. Furthermore, researchers often invest substantial effort in feature extraction, only to later discover that these features lack informativeness. Results In this paper, we present DrivR-Base, an innovative resource that efficiently extracts and integrates molecular information (features) for single nucleotide variants from a wide range of databases and tools, including AlphaFold, ENCODE, and Variant Effect Predictor. The resulting features can be used as input for machine learning models designed to predict the pathogenic impact of human genome variants in disease. Moreover, these feature sets have applications beyond this, including haploinsufficiency prediction and the development of drug repurposing tools. We describe the resource’s development, practical applications, and potential for future expansion and enhancement.

Yet, few studies have integrated several multiplexed assays to map variant effects on gene expression in coding sequences. Here, we pioneered a multiplexed assay based on polysome profiling to measure variant effects on translation at scale, uncovering single-nucleotide variants that increase and decrease ribosome load. By combining high-throughput ribosome load data with multiplexed mRNA and protein abundance readouts, we mapped the cis-regulatory landscape of thousands of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) variants from RNA to protein and found numerous coding variants that alter COMT expression. Finally, we trained machine learning models to map signatures of variant effects on COMT gene expression and uncovered both directional and divergent impacts across expression layers. Our analyses reveal expression phenotypes for thousands of variants in COMT and highlight variant effects on both single and multiple layers of expression. Our findings prompt future studies that integrate several multiplexed assays for the readout of gene expression.",bioRxiv,journal,,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,bioRxiv,,,N/A,2023,2023-11-17 00:00:00,1,96,"Ian Hoskins, Shilpa Rao, Charisma Tante, Can Cenik","1945825352, 2228620589, 2230125020, 2242933",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b76329a07900d1c40f199af7529028e04099d67,"Biology, Chemistry, Medicine",1945825352

SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain a focus, with regular annotation updates to the browser and continued curation of our phylogenetic sequence placing tool, hgPhyloPlace, whose tree has now reached over 12M sequences. Our GenArk resource has also grown, offering over 2500 hubs and a system for users to request any absent assemblies. We have expanded our bigBarChart display type and created new ways to visualize data via bigRmsk and dynseq display. Displaying custom annotations is now easier due to our chromAlias system which eliminates the requirement for renaming sequence names to the UCSC standard.

While somatic SNVs near canonical splice sites have been reported to cause abnormal splicing of cancer-related genes, whether these SNVs can affect gene expression through other mechanisms remains an open question. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing and exome data from 4,998 cancer patients covering ten cancer types and identified 152 somatic SNVs near splice sites that were associated with abnormal intronic polyadenylation (IPA). IPA-associated somatic variants favored the localization near the donor splice sites compared to the acceptor splice sites. A proportion of SNV-associated IPA events overlapped with premature cleavage and polyadenylation events triggered by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) inhibition. GC content, intron length and polyadenylation signal were three genomic features that differentiated between SNV-associated IPA and intron retention. Notably, IPA-associated SNVs were enriched in tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including the well-known TSGs such as PTEN and CDH1 with recurrent SNV-associated IPA events. Minigene assay confirmed that SNVs from PTEN, CDH1, VEGFA, GRHL2, CUL3 and WWC2 could lead to IPA. This work reveals that IPA acts as a novel mechanism explaining the functional consequence of somatic SNVs in human cancer.",Nucleic Acids Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],da96c220-cd39-4894-bae6-d2d77c8e7aa9,Nucleic Acids Research,10369 - 10381,49,N/A,2021,2021-09-11 00:00:00,16,65,"Zhaozhao Zhao, Qiushi Xu, Ran Wei, Leihuan Huang, Weixu Wang, Gang Wei, T.

Occurrences and numbers of insects can be monitored through insect traps, which include their permanent touring and checking of their condition. Another more efficient way is to set up sensor devices with a camera at the traps that will photograph the traps and forward the images to the Internet, where the pest insect’s appearance will be predicted by image analysis. Weather conditions, temperature and relative humidity are the parameters that affect the appearance of some pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera. This paper presents a model of machine learning that can predict the appearance of insects during a season on a daily basis, taking into account the air temperature and relative humidity. Several machine learning algorithms for classification were applied and their accuracy for the prediction of insect occurrence was presented (up to 76.5%). Since the data used for testing were given in chronological order according to the days when the measurement was performed, the existing model was expanded to take into account the periods of three and five days. The extended method showed better accuracy of prediction and a lower percentage of false detections. In the case of a period of five days, the accuracy of the affected detections was 86.3%, while the percentage of false detections was 11%. The proposed model of machine learning can help farmers to detect the occurrence of pests and save the time and resources needed to check the fields.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,396,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,42,40,"D.

However, the most common methods to assess aroma are based on expensive equipment or human senses through sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and requires highly trained assessors to avoid subjectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the coffee intensity and aromas using a low-cost and portable electronic nose (e-nose) and machine learning modeling. For this purpose, triplicates of nine commercial coffee samples with different intensity levels were used for this study. Two machine learning models were developed based on artificial neural networks using the data from the e-nose as inputs to (i) classify the samples into low, medium, and high-intensity (Model 1) and (ii) to predict the relative abundance of 45 different aromas (Model 2). Results showed that it is possible to estimate the intensity of coffees with high accuracy (98%; Model 1), as well as to predict the specific aromas obtaining a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99), and no under- or over-fitting of the models were detected. The proposed contactless, nondestructive, rapid, reliable, and low-cost method showed to be effective in evaluating volatile compounds in coffee, which is a potential technique to be applied within all stages of the production process to detect any undesirable characteristics on–time and ensure high-quality products.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,396,2021,2021-03-01 00:00:00,64,67,"Claudia Gonzalez Viejo, E.

The evolution of the activities of the GSC over this period has been driven by evolving geographic, economic and political contexts and needs. Likewise, new technologies and evolving scientific methods and models shaped broadly the successive generations of GSC geoscience activities. The most recent GSC generation presented a mixed portfolio of large framework mapping geoscience programmes, and more targeted, hypothesis-driven geoscience research, and the development of decision support products for a range of government, industry and other stakeholders needs. Entering its eighth generation, the GSC and related organizations are embracing digital technologies for applications such as the evaluation of mineral resource potential, the evaluation of risks and the early warning of earthquakes. In order to do so, the GSC will need to develop new methods and systems in co-operation with other geological survey organizations, and target its data acquisition and research to further advance its ability to respond to the evolving needs of society to navigate geology through space and time, from the past to the present, and from the present to the future.",Special Publications,Unknown,['Review'],Unknown,Special Publications,49 - 68,499,Unknown,2019,2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,35,D.

It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world's population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.",Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",2ca1e2ac-8c3b-4251-94ed-24846d391d3b,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,,2022,N/A,2022,2022-01-20 00:00:00,53,84,"Milind Natu, M.

It is crucial to detect and patch vulnerabilities before attacks happen. However, existing vulnerability detection methods suffer from long-term dependency, out of vocabulary, bias towards global features or local features, and coarse detection granularity. This paper proposes an automatic vulnerability detection framework in source code based on a hybrid neural network. First, the inputs are transformed into an intermediate representation with explicit structure information using lower level virtual machine intermediate representation (LLVM IR) and backward program slicing. After the transformation, the size of samples and the size of vocabulary are significantly reduced. A hybrid neural network model is then applied to extract high-level features of vulnerability, which learns features both from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The former is applied to learn local vulnerability features, such as buffer size. Furthermore, the latter is utilized to learn global features, such as data dependency. The extracted features are made up of concatenated outputs of CNN and RNN. Experiments are performed to validate our vulnerability detection method. The results show that our proposed method achieves excellent results with F1-scores of 98.6% and accuracy of 99.0% on the SARD dataset.

Recently, the accumulation of a large amount of multiscale omics data, such as next-generation sequencing data and protein interaction data, provides opportunity to investigate the functions of molecules from a systematic perspective. On the other hand, the analysis of these huge datasets demands efficient and robust computational methods. In this special issue, we reported the recent progress made in developing new computational methodologies to analyze the genomics data, construct gene networks, and identify disease genes. 
 
Understanding the Functions of Molecules in the Postgenomic Age. In recent years, the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology makes it more easier for researchers to access and analyze genetics data and has influential effects on the biomedical research community. However, compared with sequencing, computational analysis of the flooding sequencing data with appropriate tools is becoming a more important task when interpreting the data. In their review paper, M. P. Dolled-Filhart et al. described the pipeline for bioinformatics analysis of the NGS data, starting from alignment to variant calling as well as filtering and annotation. In each step, they discussed the tools or software that should be used as well as their advantages and caveats. This survey of the bioinformatics analysis of NGS data can help researchers to choose appropriate tools when dealing with the sequencing data. 
 
Along with the sequencing technology, lines of evidence show that a lot of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes. Unlike the protein-coding genes that are well studied, the functions of most ncRNAs are not clear. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop computational methods to predict the functions of the ncRNAs. H. Ma et al. conducted a survey about the computational approaches developed to predict and annotate the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which can help researchers to learn the progress in this filed and future directions in which bioinformaticists should work while annotating lncRNAs. 
 
While annotating the functions of molecules, standard and controlled vocabularies are required. Hence, the ontologies that are represented as abstract description systems of knowledge are becoming more and more popular recently. At the same time, it is becoming a difficult task to calculate the semantic similarity between ontology terms quantitatively. M. Gan et al. introduced popular methods in quantitating the semantic similarity between ontology terms and their software implementations. Furthermore, they classified these methods into distinct categories and discussed their advantages and shortcomings, which can help researchers to select appropriate tools and methods when working on ontologies. 
 
Gene expression profiles can describe the molecular mechanisms that underlie certain phenotypes. However, while analyzing the gene expression data, it is inappropriate to treat genes independently considering genes interact with each other within the cell. O. Frings et al. proposed a network-based approach to analyze the gene expression data and applied it to investigate the development of sex-specific chicken gonad and brain tissues. By combining the chicken network and the gene expression data, they identified some sex-biased characteristics, for example, same sex-biased genes tend to be tightly connected in the network, and provided new insights into the molecular underpinnings of sex-biased genes. 
 
Construction and Analysis of Gene Networks. Construction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a crucial step in systems biology, where gene expression data is widely explored to infer the GRNs. However, the high dimensionality and notorious noise of the gene expression data makes it a nontrivial task to infer the GRNs. N. You et al. presented a new Laplace error penalty (LEP) model to calculate the partial correlation coefficients between genes and construct the GRNs. Compared with the popular least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) approaches, the LEP method reached the highest precision. Except for gene expression data, integration of different data sources may improve the accuracy of inferred GRNs. H. Chen et al. surveyed the strategies to integrate distinct data sources and their effectiveness and recommended how to choose an appropriate strategy while integrating distinct data sources. N. Nakajima et al. proposed a novel network completion approach, DPLSQ, to infer gene networks. Benchmarking on artificial datasets, their proposed DPLSQ outperforms popular ARACNE and GeneNet with the highest accuracy. By investigating a 2-gene network, A. V. Spirov et al. found that gene cooption can affect the robustness of GRNs, and the findings provide new insights into the evolvability and robustness of GRNs. 
 
Network modules are found to be functional blocks of gene networks, the identification of which is becoming a hot research topic. By taking the hierarchical modular structure into account, S. Zhang presented a new stochastic block model to detect the hierarchical modules. Applied to the real yeast gene coexpression network, the proposed method can efficiently detect the hierarchical modular structures that are consistent with biological functions. Recently, it is found that a particular type of ncRNAs, microRNAs, plays important roles in gene regulation by working together with transcription factors. W. Mu et al. proposed a new local genetic algorithm to predict condition-specific regulatory modules that consist of microRNAs, transcription factors, and their commonly regulated genes, and these modules provide useful insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression. 
 
Computational Approaches to Hunting Disease-Associated Genes. The identification of genetic variants that are responsible for human diseases is critical for understanding the development of diseases and designing new effective drugs. Thanks to the genome-wide association studies (GWASs), some genetic variants that drive diseases have been identified, among which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are receiving more and more attention. In this issue, J. Wu and R. Jiang reviewed the databases that collect nsSNPs and summarized popular computational methods that identify deleterious nsSNPs. In addition, they introduced machine learning models that are useful in predicting deleterious nsSNPs. Beyond SNP-based association analysis, gene-based association analysis is receiving increasing attention. X. Guo et al. comprehensively compared these two approaches on the data from the study of addiction and found that these two approaches complement with each other and can get better results when used together. 
 
The differentially expressed genes identified from microarray data are generally regarded as candidate disease genes. However, the number of differentially expressed genes may reach hundreds or even thousands, thereby making it difficult to identify the potential disease genes. In this issue, L. Li et al. proposed a new hybrid approach to predict disease genes based on estimation of distribution algorithm and support vector machine. Benchmarking on B-cell lymphoma and colon cancer datasets, their method outperforms two other popular approaches and identify some new candidate genes for future validation.",TheScientificWorldJournal,Unknown,"['Editorial', 'Review']",Unknown,The Scientific World Journal,,2013,Unknown,2013,2013-03-12 00:00:00,653,0,"Xingming Zhao, Weidong Tian, R.

Thanks to these fortunate characteristics, this type of motor has various applications in high-tech industries. However, since BLDC motors are often required to operate at high-speed rotations and under extreme conditions, temperature overshoots can appear during operation, provoking damage to the windings. The purpose of this review is to present the results of a recent investigation and recollection of different methods used for the diagnosis of electrical faults in the stator, such as turn-to-turn short circuits, coil-to-coil short circuits, phase-to-phase short circuits and phase open circuits. In particular, this review presents an analysis of the available diagnosis methods according to the type of fault, the method or technique used for the diagnosis, the evaluated physical variables and the context in which the methods were evaluated (in simulations or in experimental tests). Based on this analysis, the following classifications of diagnostic methods are proposed: signal-based, model-based and data-based methods. Then, the pros and cons of each method class are described and discussed.",Processes,,['Review'],939ba3df-4270-4ba0-ad98-ffe889f3546e,Processes,,,Unknown,2022,2022-12-28 00:00:00,12,41,"R.

75eb4e19edd7d78a2dff8da5746952ba92dba391,10.3389/fnmol.2021.807969,Gabaergic Interneurons in Early Brain Development: Conducting and Orchestrated by Cortical Network Activity,"Throughout early phases of brain development, the two main neural signaling mechanisms—excitation and inhibition—are dynamically sculpted in the neocortex to establish primary functions. Despite its relatively late formation and persistent developmental changes, the GABAergic system promotes the ordered shaping of neuronal circuits at the structural and functional levels. Within this frame, interneurons participate first in spontaneous and later in sensory-evoked activity patterns that precede cortical functions of the mature brain. Upon their subcortical generation, interneurons in the embryonic brain must first orderly migrate to and settle in respective target layers before they can actively engage in cortical network activity. During this process, changes at the molecular and synaptic level of interneurons allow not only their coordinated formation but also the pruning of connections as well as excitatory and inhibitory synapses. At the postsynaptic site, the shift of GABAergic signaling from an excitatory towards an inhibitory response is required to enable synchronization within cortical networks. Concomitantly, the progressive specification of different interneuron subtypes endows the neocortex with distinct local cortical circuits and region-specific modulation of neuronal firing. Finally, the apoptotic process further refines neuronal populations by constantly maintaining a controlled ratio of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Interestingly, many of these fundamental and complex processes are influenced—if not directly controlled—by electrical activity. Interneurons on the subcellular, cellular, and network level are affected by high frequency patterns, such as spindle burst and gamma oscillations in rodents and delta brushes in humans. Conversely, the maturation of interneuron structure and function on each of these scales feeds back and contributes to the generation of cortical activity patterns that are essential for the proper peri- and postnatal development. Overall, a more precise description of the conducting role of interneurons in terms of how they contribute to specific activity patterns—as well as how specific activity patterns impinge on their maturation as orchestra members—will lead to a better understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological development and function of the nervous system.",Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],7101fb84-a263-47ee-80ff-743ece1018d3,Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience,,14,N/A,2022,2022-01-03 00:00:00,32,230,"David Warm, Jonas Schroer, A.

An intriguing question is how physiological neuronal activity modifies the expression of these molecules in developing cortical networks. Here, we addressed this issue, focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the factors underlying cortical wiring. Real-time imaging of BDNF promoter activity in organotypic slice cultures revealed that patterned stimuli differentially regulated the increase and the time course of the promoter activity in upper layer neurons. Calcium imaging further demonstrated that stimulus-dependent increases in the promoter activity were roughly proportional to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration per unit time. Finally, optogenetic stimulation showed that the promoter activity was increased efficiently by patterned stimulation in defined cortical circuits. These results suggest that physiological stimulation patterns differentially tune activity-dependent gene expression in developing cortical neurons via cortical circuits, synaptic responses, and alteration of intracellular calcium signaling.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],2ca4279c-8ed7-4280-8022-09e577923a09,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,15,N/A,2021,2021-12-10 00:00:00,15,80,"Yumi Miyasaka, N.

Along this journey, Digital Twin has been introduced to the industry as a concept that holds the promise to challenge the status-quo and address long standing problems of productivity, efficiency, and value. While this concept is becoming more familiar among practitioners, there is a lack of universal definitions of what the Digital Twin of a construction project is. Additionally, while identifying the purpose of Digital Twin is recognized as the first step in implementing Digital Twins, there is little discussion on the perception of construction practitioners of the extent to which Digital Twin can deliver value. To address these research gaps and building on the existing work on Digital Twins in the context of the construction industry, this paper first proposes a definition of the Digital Twin of a construction project. Next, a series of semi-structured interviews are conducted with nine construction practitioners to understand their perceptions on the use and challenges of Digital Twins. Thematic analysis is then used to analyze interview data and summarize Digital Twins applications, capabilities, and challenges. Forty direct applications were identified and grouped into seven capabilities. Digital Twins capabilities of Increase Transparency of Information and Real-Time Monitoring, Analysis, and Feedback were the most discussed with a total of eight applications each, followed by Better Stakeholder Collaboration which had seven applications. The discussion on challenges led to the identification of 34 challenges to implementing Digital Twin, grouped into six categories coded through thematic analysis. The category on Data Understanding, Preparation, and Usage Challenges was found to be the most critical for the interviewees. Additionally, the paper presents a case study on how building authority can be integrated into Digital Twins and leverage its use throughout the lifecycle of a building. Future work can further investigate the challenges and develop prototypes that can help in quantifying the benefits of implementing Digital Twins on a Construction Project.",Frontiers in Built Environment,journal,,d44a90af-d645-4877-9b98-d89aedc53d99,,,8,N/A,2022,2022-06-13 00:00:00,51,80,"Ashtarout Ammar, Hala Nassereddine, Nadine AbdulBaky, Anwar AbouKansour, Juliano Tannoury, H.

Intrapartum complications are one of the major causes of perinatal mortality. Fetal cardiotocograph (CTGs) can be used as a monitoring tool to identify high-risk women during labor. Aim: The objective of this study was to study the precision of machine learning algorithm techniques on CTG data in identifying high-risk fetuses. Methods: CTG data of 2126 pregnant women were obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Ten different machine learning classification models were trained using CTG data. Sensitivity, precision, and F1 score for each class and overall accuracy of each model were obtained to predict normal, suspect, and pathological fetal states. Model with best performance on specified metrics was then identified. Results: Determined by obstetricians' interpretation of CTGs as gold standard, 70% of them were normal, 20% were suspect, and 10% had a pathological fetal state. On training data, the classification models generated by XGBoost, decision tree, and random forest had high precision (>96%) to predict the suspect and pathological state of the fetus based on the CTG tracings. However, on testing data, XGBoost model had the highest precision to predict a pathological fetal state (>92%). Conclusion: The classification model developed using XGBoost technique had the highest prediction accuracy for an adverse fetal outcome. Lay health-care workers in low- and middle-income countries can use this model to triage pregnant women in remote areas for early referral and further management.",International Journal of Applied and Basic Medical Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],d7dc05be-d184-41e5-bcb2-9060c5fbe959,International Journal of Applied and Basic Medical Research,226 - 230,9,N/A,2019,2019-10-01 00:00:00,52,24,"Zahra Hoodbhoy, Mohammad Noman, Ayesha Shafique, A.

However, the lack of regularly updated, continental-scale, and high spatial resolution (30 m) land cover data limit our ability to better understand the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of land surface changes. Despite the free availability of high spatial resolution Landsat satellite data, continental-scale land cover mapping using high resolution Landsat satellite data was not feasible until now due to the need for high-performance computing to store, process, and analyze this large volume of high resolution satellite data. In this study, we present an approach to quantify continental land cover and impervious surface changes over a long period of time (15 years) using high resolution Landsat satellite observations and Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform.

The proposed PSO based SVM classifier is able to select appropriate input features and optimize SVM parameters to increase classification accuracy. Further, a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method with a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) stimulus has been used to generate a dataset for purposes of classification. The proposed technique has been tested on a typical radial distribution network to identify ten different types of faults considering 12 given input features generated by using Simulink software and MATLAB Toolbox.

They employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to allow a local passive adversary to uncover the Web browsing behavior of a user, even if she browses through an encrypted tunnel (e.g. Tor, VPN). Numerous defenses have been proposed in the past; however, it is typically difficult to have formal guarantees on their security, which is most often evaluated empirically against state-of-the-art attacks. In this paper, we present a practical method to derive security bounds for any WF defense, where the bounds depend on a chosen feature set. This result derives from reducing WF attacks to an ML classification task, where we can determine the smallest achievable error (the Bayes error). Such error can be estimated in practice, and is a lower bound for a WF adversary, for any classification algorithm he may use. Our work has two main consequences: i) it allows determining the security of WF defenses, in a black-box manner, with respect to the state-of-the-art feature set and ii) it favors shifting the focus of future WF research to identifying optimal feature sets. The generality of this approach further suggests that the method could be used to define security bounds for other ML-based attacks.",Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,,['JournalArticle'],d5dc4224-e4c3-43c9-918a-bd6326650b5b,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,215 - 231,2017,Unknown,2017,2017-02-24 00:00:00,37,37,Giovanni Cherubin,2591635,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f0afe85012146ba0791eff4f0075494a53534fe,Computer Science,2591635

Machine learning evolved from the study of pattern recognition and explores the notion that algorithms can learn from and make predictions on data. And, as they begin to become more ‘intelligent’, these algorithms can overcome program instructions to make highly accurate, data-driven decisions. Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques (including machine learning, predictive modelling and data mining) and uses statistics (both historical and current) to estimate, or ‘predict’, future outcomes. These outcomes might be behaviors of a customer likely to exhibit or possible changes in the market, for example. Predictive analytics help us to understand possible future occurrences by analyzing the past. In this research it’s intended to combine machine learning algorithms with predictive analytics to do predictions on sports results specially football matches result prediction.",International Journal of Engineering Applied Sciences and Technology,journal,,3160206c-9131-4319-995b-582bc038f4e6,International Journal of Engineering Applied Sciences and Technology,,,N/A,2020,2020-07-31 00:00:00,5,29,"Sayed Muhammad Yonus Saiedy, Muhammad Aslam Hemmat Qachmas, Dr. Amanullah Faqiri","2126597794, 2137872594, 2137853284",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014f67923fecc0fe3f0349adaa08a627fd65ef01,Computer Science,2126597794

Genetic testing is crucial for establishing a treatment plan. In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to discover that LRP1B mutation was associated with a poor prognosis in GC. Through layer-by-layer research, it was found that LRP1B expression in GC was accompanied by a higher-level infiltration of CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163. It is concluded that LRP1B expression can stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration, thus bringing clinical benefits to GC patients. Abstract Background: Recent studies have shown that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1b (LRP1B), as a potential tumor suppressor, is implicated in the response to immunotherapy. The frequency of LRP1B mutation gene is high in many cancers, but its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not been determined. Methods: The prognostic value of LRP1B mutation in a cohort containing 100 patients having received radical gastrectomy for stage II–III GC was explored. By analyzing the data of LRP1B mRNA, the risk score of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LRP1B mutation-type and wild-type was constructed based on the TCGA-STAD cohort. The infiltration of tumor immune cells was evaluated by the CYBERSORT algorithm and verified by immunohistochemistry. Results: LRP1B gene mutation was an independent risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in GC patients (HR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.28–5.14, p = 0.008). The Kaplan–Meier curve demonstrated a shorter survival time in high-risk patients stratified according to risk score (p < 0.0001). CYBERSORT analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly concentrated in CD4+ T cells and macrophages. TIMER analysis suggested that LRP1B expression was associated with the infiltration of CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LRP1B was expressed in the tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells in 16/89 and 26/89 of the cohort, respectively. LRP1B-positive TCs were associated with higher levels of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163 (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that LRP1B-positive TCs represented an independent protective factor of DFS in GC patients (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.10–0.93, p = 0.042). Conclusions: LRP1B has a high prognostic value in GC. LRP1B may stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration to provide GC patients with survival benefits.",Cancers,journal,['JournalArticle'],d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,15,N/A,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,5,43,"Rui Wang, Guangtao Zhang, Xiaohong Zhu, Yan Xu, N.

Accurate suggestions of reaction conditions are required for experimental validation and can have a significant effect on the success or failure of an attempted transformation. However, de novo condition recommendation remains a challenging and under-explored problem and relies heavily on chemists’ knowledge and experience. In this work, we develop a neural-network model to predict the chemical context (catalyst(s), solvent(s), reagent(s)), as well as the temperature most suitable for any particular organic reaction. Trained on ∼10 million examples from Reaxys, the model is able to propose conditions where a close match to the recorded catalyst, solvent, and reagent is found within the top-10 predictions 69.6% of the time, with top-10 accuracies for individual species reaching 80–90%. Temperature is accurately predicted within ±20 °C from the recorded temperature in 60–70% of test cases, with higher accuracy for cases with correct chemical context predictions. The utility of the model is illustrated through several examples spanning a range of common reaction classes. We also demonstrate that the model implicitly learns a continuous numerical embedding of solvent and reagent species that captures their functional similarity.",ACS Central Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],df882f0f-d88c-4139-8462-219dcb05d97c,ACS Central Science,1465 - 1476,4,N/A,2018,2018-11-16 00:00:00,266,54,"Hanyu Gao, Thomas J.

Zamzama gas field demonstrates the complex nature of lithofacies due to the heterogeneous nature of the reservoir formation, while it is quite challenging to identify the lithofacies. Using our machine learning approach and cluster analysis, we can not only resolve these difficulties, but also minimize their time-consuming aspects and provide an accurate result even when the user is inexperienced. To constrain accurate reservoir models, rock type identification is a critical step in reservoir characterization. Many empirical and statistical methodologies have been established based on the effect of rock type on reservoir performance. Only well-logged data are provided, and no cores are sampled. Given these circumstances, and the fact that traditional methods such as regression are intractable, we have chosen to apply three strategies: (1) using a self-organizing map (SOM) to arrange depth intervals with similar facies into clusters; (2) clustering to split various facies into specific zones; and (3) the cluster analysis technique is used to identify rock type. In the Zamzama gas field, SOM and cluster analysis techniques discovered four group of facies, each of which was internally comparable in petrophysical properties but distinct from the others. Gamma Ray (GR), Effective Porosity(eff), Permeability (Perm) and Water Saturation (Sw) are used to generate these results. The findings and behavior of four facies shows that facies-01 and facies-02 have good characteristics for acting as gas-bearing sediments, whereas facies-03 and facies-04 are non-reservoir sediments. The outcomes of this study stated that facies-01 is an excellent rock-type zone in the reservoir of the Zamzama gas field.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-20 00:00:00,33,43,"M.

Unfortunately, current deep networks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge devices, but also too large for communicating updates over bandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and experimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse Training (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained with substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and in-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that extracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this scheme, ""two birds are killed with one stone:'' instead of full models, each client performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse networks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly accommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse masks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an ""in-time self-ensembling effect'' into the training dynamics, and improves the FL performance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d. FL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our experiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it gains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same upload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2 times the upload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

Emerging immunotherapeutic approaches have ignited fresh optimism for patient outcomes. This investigation probes the link between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC through Mendelian Randomization and single-cell sequencing, aiming to unearth viable drug targets and dissect HCC's etiology. Methods: We conducted an exhaustive two-sample Mendelian Randomization analysis to ascertain the causal links between immune cell features and HCC, utilizing publicly accessible genetic datasets to explore the causal connections of 731 immune cell traits with HCC susceptibility. The integrity, diversity, and potential horizontal pleiotropy of these findings were rigorously assessed through extensive sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing was employed to penetrate the pathogenic underpinnings of HCC. Results: Establishing a significance threshold of pval_Inverse.variance.weighted at 0.05, our study pinpointed five immune characteristics potentially elevating HCC risk: B cell % CD3- lymphocyte (TBNK panel), CD25 on IgD+ (B cell panel), HVEM on TD CD4+ (Maturation stages of T cell panel), CD14 on CD14+ CD16- monocyte (Monocyte panel), CD4 on CD39+ activated Treg ( Treg panel). Conversely, various cellular phenotypes tied to BAFF-R expression emerged as protective elements. Single-cell sequencing unveiled profound immune cell phenotype interactions, highlighting marked disparities in cell communication and metabolic activities. Conclusion: Leveraging MR and scRNA-seq techniques, our study elucidates potential associations between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC, offering a window into the molecular interplays among cellular phenotypes, and addressing the limitations of mono-antibody therapeutic targets.",Journal of Cancer,journal,['JournalArticle'],3120f100-cfa2-4130-bd3d-fc7b1a04ca48,Journal of Cancer,4219 - 4231,15,N/A,2024,2024-06-03 00:00:00,12,66,"Jingyi Tang, Shengke Zhang, Lai Jiang, Jie Liu, Jiayu Xu, Chenglu Jiang, Zipei Chen, Xuancheng Zhou, Claire Fuller, Jinbang Huang, Haiqing Chen, Guanhu Yang, Changsong Bai, Defeng Yin, Bo Li, Hao Chi","2290390357, 2261234215, 2244275006, 2290194060, 2276273257, 2220921654, 2290165950, 2276208210, 2303621918, 2230909440, 2244805960, 2244586130, 2307483379, 2261459373, 2308045663, 2244316010",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58dc6f8c942361560fa67583eb2d852e433b8402,"Biology, Medicine",2290390357

Nevertheless, its specific role in the context of gastric cancer (GC) remains uncertain. Methods: In this study, we integrated multi-omics algorithms to investigate the molecular characteristics of parthanatos in GC. A series of bioinformatics algorithms were utilized to explore clinical heterogeneity of GC and further predict the clinical outcomes. Results: Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the omics features of parthanatos in various human tumors, including genomic mutations, transcriptome expression, and prognostic relevance. We successfully identified 7 cell types within the GC microenvironment: myeloid cell, epithelial cell, T cell, stromal cell, proliferative cell, B cell, and NK cell. When compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, single-cell sequencing results from GC tissues revealed elevated scores for the parthanatos pathway across multiple cell types. Spatial transcriptomics, for the first time, unveiled the spatial distribution characteristics of parthanatos signaling. GC patients with different parthanatos signals often exhibited distinct immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming features, leading to different clinical outcomes. The integration of parthanatos signaling and clinical indicators enabled the creation of novel survival curves that accurately assess patients’ survival times and statuses. Conclusions: In this study, the molecular characteristics of parthanatos’ unicellular and spatial transcriptomics in GC were revealed for the first time.

Initially, single-cell atlas of LDCD signal in KIRC was comprehensively depicted. We also emphasized the molecular characteristics of LDCD-RGs in various human neoplasms. Predicated upon the expressive quotients of LDCD-RGs, we stratified KIRC patients into tripartite cohorts denoted as C1, C2, and C3. Those allocated to the ambit of C1 evinced the most sanguine prognosis within the KIRC cohort, underscored by the acme of LDCD-RGs scores. This further confirms the significant role that LDCD-RGs play in both the pathophysiological foundation and clinical implications of KIRC. In culmination, by virtue of employing the LASSO-Cox analytical modality, we have ushered in an innovative and avant-garde prognostic framework tailored for KIRC, predicated on the bedrock of LDCD-RGs. The assemblage of KIRC instances was arbitrarily apportioned into constituents inclusive of a didactic cohort, an internally wielded validation cadre, and an externally administered validation cohort. Concurrently, patients were dichotomized into strata connoting elevated jeopardy synonymous with adverse prognostic trajectories, and conversely, diminished risk tantamount to favorable prognoses, contingent on the calibrated expressions of LDCD-RGs. Succinctly, our investigative findings serve to underscore the cardinal capacity harbored by LDCD-RGs within the KIRC milieu, concurrently birthing a pioneering prognostic schema intrinsically linked to the trajectory of KIRC and its attendant prognoses.",Aging,,['JournalArticle'],26e723bf-bfa5-4e58-bf99-8abac36e938e,Aging (Albany NY),4862 - 4888,16,Unknown,2024,2024-03-07 00:00:00,2,48,"Shunliang He, Jiaao Sun, Hewen Guan, Ji Su, Xu Chen, Zhijun Hong, Jianbo Wang","2290656285, 2044638035, 2199526835, 2279673527, 2118183907, 2285763950, 2279400763",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72b7d73bc84580cfdafaeb08b2cdc62e7c6e8a64,Medicine,2290656285

Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive pan-cancer investigations of MAPK signaling, particularly within the context of KIRC. In this research, we obtained TCGA pan-cancer multi-omics data and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the MAPK signaling pathway. For in-depth investigation in KIRC, status of MAPK pathway was quantitatively estimated by ssGSEA and Ward algorithm was utilized for cluster analysis. Molecular characteristics and clinical prognoses of KIRC patients with distinct MAPK activities were comprehensively explored using a series of bioinformatics algorithms. Subsequently, a combination of LASSO and COX regression analyses were utilized sequentially to construct a MAPK-related signature to help identify the risk level of each sample. Patients in the C1 subtype exhibited relatively higher levels of MAPK signaling activity, which were associated with abundant immune cell infiltration and favorable clinical outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of KIRC samples identified seven distinct cell types, and endothelial cells in tumor tissues had obviously higher MAPK scores than normal tissues. The immunohistochemistry results indicated the reduced expression levels of PAPSS1, MAP3K11, and SPRED1 in KIRC samples.

Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional study design, typically used in measurement-related studies. A sample of 167 children, ages 5–11 years (mean ± SD: 8.0 ± 1.8 years), performed up to eight seated sedentary activities while wearing accelerometers on both wrists. Activities included: reading books, sorting cards, cutting and pasting, playing board games, eating snacks, playing with tablets, watching TV, and writing. Direct observation verified sedentary behavior from light activity. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to determine optimal cut-point thresholds. Quantile regression models estimated differences between dominant and non-dominant placement. Results: The optimal cut-point threshold for the non-dominant wrist was 203 counts/5 s with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 71.56, 70.83, and 0.72, respectively. A 10-fold cross-validation revealed an average AUC of 0.70. Statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences in median counts ranging from 7 to 46 counts/5 s were found between dominant and non-dominant placement in five out of eight sedentary activities, with the dominant wrist eliciting higher counts/5 s.

But most of the state-of-the-art GCN models are shallow structures with depths of no more than 3 to 4 layers, which greatly limits the ability of GCN models to extract high-level features of nodes. There are two main reasons for this: 1) Overlaying too many graph convolution layers will lead to the problem of over-smoothing. 2) Graph convolution is a kind of localized filter, which is easily affected by local properties. To solve the above problems, we first propose a novel general framework for graph neural networks called Non-local Message Passing (NLMP). Under this framework, very deep graph convolutional networks can be flexibly designed, and the over-smoothing phenomenon can be suppressed very effectively. Second, we propose a new spatial graph convolution layer to extract node multiscale high-level node features. Finally, we design an end-to-end Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network II (DGCNNII) model for graph classification task, which is up to 32 layers deep. And the effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by quantifying the graph smoothness of each layer and ablation studies.

Usually, not all columns show important values. As a result, the machine learning models may perform poorly since the noise or unnecessary columns may confound the algorithms. To address this issue, various feature selection methods have been developed to evaluate large dimensional datasets and identify their subsets of pertinent features. The data, however, frequently skews feature selection algorithms. As a result, ensemble approaches have emerged as a substitute that incorporates the benefits of single feature selection algorithms and makes up for their drawbacks. In order to handle feature selection on datasets with large dimensionality, this research aims to grasp the key ideas and links in the process of aggregating feature selection methods. The suggested idea is tested by creating a cross-validation implementation that combines a number of Python packages with functionality to enable the feature selection techniques.

With these data, defect prediction software can try to estimate the defect proneness of a software module, with the objective of assisting and guiding software practitioners. With timely and accurate defect predictions, practitioners can focus their limited testing resources on higher risk areas. This paper reports the results of three empirical studies that uses an automated genetic defect prediction framework. This framework generates and compares different learning schemes (preprocessing + attribute selection + learning algorithms) and selects the best one using a genetic algorithm, with the objective to estimate the defect proneness of a software module. The first empirical study is a performance comparison of our framework with the most important framework of the literature. The second empirical study is a performance and runtime comparison between our framework and an exhaustive framework. The third empirical study is a sensitivity analysis. The last empirical study, is our main contribution in this paper. Performance of the software development defect prediction models (using AUC, Area Under the Curve) was validated using NASA-MDP and PROMISE data sets. Seventeen data sets from NASA-MDP (13) and PROMISE (4) projects were analyzed running a NxM-fold cross-validation. A genetic algorithm was used to select the components of the learning schemes automatically, and to assess and report the results. Our results reported similar performance between frameworks. Our framework reported better runtime than exhaustive framework. Finally, we reported the best configuration according to sensitivity analysis.",,Unknown,,Unknown,"Inteligencia Artificial,revista Iberoamericana De Inteligencia Artificial",114-137,19,Unknown,2016,2016-05-18 00:00:00,18,47,"Juan Murillo-Morera, Carlos Castro-Herrera, J.

Despite its potential to transform current pedagogies and learning experiences through engaging, interactive, and fascinating educational techniques, research is limited in exploring its application, usability, and user experience, particularly for Thai undergraduate students in learning computer engineering courses. In response, we designed and developed an innovative metaverse-based learning system called the AIIS collaborative learning interface, tailored to European undergraduate students. While the original intent of AIIS was to cater to medical students, in this study, our objective was to assess its usability and applicability for computer science and engineering students, specifically focusing on the Asian demographic. After an initial pilot with European students in their local context, the research was extended to Thailand, where 21 Thai undergraduate students evaluated the platform’s usability. The observations from this study indicate that AIIS provides a dynamic, user-friendly learning environment. Nevertheless, the evaluation process unveiled some usability flaws that offer informative directions for future enhancements. Drawing from our observations, we formulated usability guidelines to guide designers and developers toward crafting more efficient metaverse systems, particularly those intended for educational use.

Due to this problem, the present investigation has been focused on studying how time management is linked to academic stress in university students. This research study of a basic/substantive non-experimental type and correlational level has been developed under a quantitative approach with a cross section. The sample consisted of 328 students of both genders, selected from a public university in the city of Lima. Two standardized tools were adapted for data collection. Two questionnaires were also applied: time management and academic stress. The results showed that there was an inverse correlation between time management and academic stress (Spearman's Rho = .413), as well as for the dimensions of academic stress: stressors (- .405), symptoms (-, 387) and coping (, 286). It was concluded that the inverse relationships between the parameters studied will be reflected in the values obtained.

In general, vast amounts of data are collected from various sensors in an IIoT environment, and they are analyzed to prevent failures by predicting their occurrence. However, the collected data may include data irrelevant to failures and thereby decrease the prediction accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a failure prediction model using iterative feature selection. To build the model, the relevancy between each feature (i.e., each sensor) and the failure was analyzed using the random forest algorithm, to obtain the importance of the features. Then, feature selection and model building were conducted iteratively. In each iteration, a new feature was selected considering the importance and added to the selected feature set. The failure prediction model was built for each iteration via the support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the failure prediction model having the highest prediction accuracy was selected. The experimental implementation was conducted using open-source R. The results showed that the proposed failure prediction model achieved high prediction accuracy.",Symmetry,journal,['JournalArticle'],1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,454,12,N/A,2020,2020-03-12 00:00:00,10,36,"Jung-Hyok Kwon, Eui-Jik Kim","2409351, 121855842",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8a6b4f30728cb9d92f589644988396f54e7cc12,"Computer Science, Engineering",2409351

7542cd204cf08d7512bf6aac24e697a720df4f7c,10.3390/bdcc7010045,Textual Feature Extraction Using Ant Colony Optimization for Hate Speech Classification,"Feature selection and feature extraction have always been of utmost importance owing to their capability to remove redundant and irrelevant features, reduce the vector space size, control the computational time, and improve performance for more accurate classification tasks, especially in text categorization. These feature engineering techniques can further be optimized using optimization algorithms. This paper proposes a similar framework by implementing one such optimization algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), incorporating different feature selection and feature extraction techniques on textual and numerical datasets using four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest (RF). The aim is to show the difference in the results achieved on both datasets with the help of comparative analysis. The proposed feature selection and feature extraction techniques assist in enhancing the performance of the machine learning model. This research article considers numerical and text-based datasets for stroke prediction and detecting hate speech, respectively. The text dataset is prepared by extracting tweets consisting of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments from Twitter API. A maximum improvement in accuracy of 10.07% is observed for Random Forest with the TF-IDF feature extraction technique on the application of ACO. Besides, this study also highlights the limitations of text data that inhibit the performance of machine learning models, justifying the difference of almost 18.43% in accuracy compared to that of numerical data.",Big Data and Cognitive Computing,,['JournalArticle'],e7c556b0-162f-4c48-9d25-fe3c141f984e,Big Data Cogn.

The coordination of gait movement is directly affected by the cooperation and functional connectivity between muscles. However, the mechanisms of muscle operation at different gait speeds remain unclear. Therefore, this study addressed the gait speed effect on the changes in cooperative modules and functional connectivity between muscles. To this end, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals were collected from eight key lower extremity muscles of twelve healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at high, middle, and low motion speeds. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) was applied to the sEMG envelope and intermuscular coherence matrix, yielding five muscle synergies. Muscle functional networks were constructed by decomposing the intermuscular coherence matrix, revealing different layers of functional muscle networks across frequencies. In addition, the coupling strength between cooperative muscles grew with gait speed. Different coordination patterns among muscles with changes in gait speed related to the neuromuscular system regulation were identified.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering,journal,['JournalArticle'],416b088d-de72-4dbf-959e-8551984d9676,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,1230-1237,31,N/A,2023,2023-02-06 00:00:00,7,46,"Tie Liang, Huacong Miao, Hongrui Wang, Xiaoguang Liu, Xiuling Liu","2112369139, 2204823453, 2109234009, 2109010804, 2109305689",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf75253c6ec3360d80c0ccd9ea7202af2d63710d,"Engineering, Medicine",2112369139

The general aim of scene text understanding is to localize and recognize text in scene images. Text regions are first localized in the original image by a trained detector model and afterwards fed into a recognition module. The tasks of localization and recognition are highly correlated since an inaccurate localization can affect the recognition task. The main purpose of this thesis is to devise efficient methods for scene text understanding. We investigate how the latest results on deep learning can advance text understanding pipelines. Recently, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and derived methods have achieved a significant performance on semantic segmentation and pixel level classification tasks. Therefore, we took benefit of the strengths of FCN approaches in order to detect and recognize text in natural scenes images.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Electronic Letters on Computer Vision and Image Analysis,6-10,18,Unknown,2020,2020-02-07 00:00:00,1,9,Dena Bazazian,2644209,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1b49c740123e2e0a3b00afe10e856d9d54d71aa,Computer Science,2644209

However, the post-processing of binarization is essential for segmentation-based detection, which converts probability maps produced by a segmentation method into bounding boxes/regions of text. In this paper, we propose a module named Differentiable Binarization (DB), which can perform the binarization process in a segmentation network. Optimized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can adaptively set the thresholds for binarization, which not only simplifies the post-processing but also enhances the performance of text detection. Based on a simple segmentation network, we validate the performance improvements of DB on five benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and speed. In particular, with a light-weight backbone, the performance improvements by DB are significant so that we can look for an ideal tradeoff between detection accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, with a backbone of ResNet-18, our detector achieves an F-measure of 82.8, running at 62 FPS, on the MSRA-TD500 dataset.

The VANET, based on 5G (5G-VANET), provides advanced facilities to the driving of vehicles such as reliable communication, less end-to-end latency, a higher data rate transmission, reasonable cost, and assured quality of experience (QoE) for delivered services. However, the crucial challenge with these recent technologies is to design a real-time multimedia traffic shaping that maintains smooth connectivity under the unpredictable change of channel capacity and data rate due to handover for rapid vehicle mobility among roadside units. This research proposes a smart real-time multimedia traffic shaping to control the amount and the rate of the traffic sent to the 5G-VANET based on distributed reinforcement learning (RMDRL). The proposed mechanism selects the accurate decisions of coding parameters such as quantization parameters, group of pictures, and frame rate that are used to manipulate the required traffic shaping of the multimedia stream on the 5G-VANET. Furthermore, the impact of the aforementioned three coding parameters has been comprehensively studied using five video clips to achieve the optimal traffic rate value for real-time multimedia streaming on 5G communication. The proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline traffic shaping in terms of peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and end-to-end frame delay. This research will open new comfortable facilities for vehicle manufacturing to enhance the data communication system on the 5G-VANET.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-01-30 00:00:00,21,34,"A.

This study delves into the complex interplay between economic indicators and rice production, aiming to uncover correlations and build prediction models using machine learning techniques. The dataset, spanning from 1960 to 2020, includes key economic variables such as GDP, inflation rate, manufacturing output, population, population growth rate, imports, arable land area, military expenditure, and rice production. The study’s findings reveal the significant influence of economic factors on rice production in Sri Lanka. Machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Ensemble methods, and Gaussian Process Regression, demonstrate strong predictive accuracy in forecasting rice production based on economic indicators. These results underscore the importance of economic indicators in shaping rice production outcomes and highlight the potential of machine learning in predicting agricultural trends.

The lower productivity exhibited by these SMEs in Sri Lanka was identified as a result of the high participation rate of female entrepreneurs in the informal economy. An unfavourable environment has been created obstructing the transition of women entrepreneurs towards the upper echelon of the business world through diverse impediments. Thus, the research focused on exploring the barriers that hinder the business growth of women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises. Accordingly, the research was conducted as secondary research: a literature survey. In Sri Lanka, a minor percentage of female participation in small and medium enterprises occurs due to limited access to financial resources, lack of financial literacy, social prejudices, social and cultural restrictions, and limited opportunities for networking and communicating with external resources. Thus, closing the gender gap in education, giving access to capital through a concerted policy action and providing women entrepreneurs with opportunities to improve their financial literacy and educational level were highlighted as the major recommendations in the study to empower women entrepreneurs to climb the value chain. Women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises need to be facilitated with greater access to the domestic, regional and international markets in order to enable them to expand their businesses with productivity and innovation. Thus, vital policy measures should be taken to mitigate the barriers involved in formalizing the business mechanisms while focusing on increasing the benefits that women entrepreneurs can gain through that standardizing process.",Kelaniya Journal of Management,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",ec75610f-5ca7-442a-a9be-eaa05bffd2b7,Kelaniya Journal of Management,,,N/A,2024,2024-04-30 00:00:00,2,5,"D.

 In addition to the influence of climate change on water availability and hydrological risks, the effects on water quality are in the early stages of investigations. This study aims to consolidate the latest interdisciplinary research in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of assessment of water quality parameters and its prediction. This research paper specifically explores the intricate relationship between climate change and water quality parameters at Sandia station, situated within the Narmada basin in Central India. As global climatic patterns continue to shift, the repercussions on water resources have gained prominence. In this work, electrical conductivity is predicted using the KERAS data processing environment on TensorFlow. The root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), etc. are calculated between observed and predicted values to assess the model performance. A total of 10 models are developed depending upon the input geometry from past monthly timelines. The results indicate that Model no. 8, with 10 inputs performs the best based on the R2 value of 0.889. These results indicate that AI can be very helpful in analyzing the possible threats in the future for drinking, water, livestock feeding, irrigation, and so on.",Journal of Water and Climate Change,journal,['JournalArticle'],3ab6c231-a535-47cb-9af7-b55c4fe50642,Journal of Water and Climate Change,,,N/A,2024,2024-02-19 00:00:00,4,0,"Deepak Kumar Tiwari, K.

It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4–5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more. We used this library to successfully create a complete deep learning course, which we were able to write more quickly than using previous approaches, and the code was more clear.

Efficiently programming these systems has become a major challenge due to the complexity of their architectures and the efforts required to provide them with co-execution capabilities that can fully exploit the applications. There are many proposals to simplify the programming and management of acceleration devices and multi-core CPUs. However, in many cases, portability and ease of use compromise the efficiency of different devices—even more so when co-executing. Intel oneAPI, a new and powerful standards-based unified programming model, built on top of SYCL, addresses these issues. In this paper, oneAPI is provided with co-execution strategies to run the same kernel between different devices, enabling the exploitation of static and dynamic policies. This work evaluates the performance and energy efficiency for a well-known set of regular and irregular HPC benchmarks, using two heterogeneous systems composed of an integrated GPU and CPU. Static and dynamic load balancers are integrated and evaluated, highlighting single and co-execution strategies and the most significant key points of this promising technology. Experimental results show that co-execution is worthwhile when using dynamic algorithms and improves the efficiency even further when using unified shared memory.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2021,2021-09-29 00:00:00,10,37,"Raúl Nozal, J.

However, optimal IRT calibration methods have not been established and the clinical performance of these devices relative to the more common non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) remains unclear. In addition to confirming the findings of our preliminary analysis of clinical study results, the primary intent of this study was to compare methods for IRT calibration and identify best practices for assessing the performance of IRTs intended to detect EBT. A key secondary aim was to compare IRT clinical accuracy to that of NCITs. We performed a clinical thermographic imaging study of more than 1000 subjects, acquiring temperature data from several facial locations that, along with reference oral temperatures, were used to calibrate two IRT systems based on seven different regression methods. Oral temperatures imputed from facial data were used to evaluate IRT clinical accuracy based on metrics such as clinical bias (Δcb), repeatability, root-mean-square difference, and sensitivity/specificity. We proposed several calibration approaches designed to account for the non-uniform data density across the temperature range and a constant offset approach tended to show better ability to detect EBT. As in our prior study, inner canthi or full-face maximum temperatures provided the highest clinical accuracy. With an optimal calibration approach, these methods achieved a Δcb between ±0.03 °C with standard deviation (σΔcb) less than 0.3 °C, and sensitivity/specificity between 84% and 94%. Results of forehead-center measurements with NCITs or IRTs indicated reduced performance. An analysis of the complete clinical data set confirms the essential findings of our preliminary evaluation, with minor differences. Our findings provide novel insights into methods and metrics for the clinical accuracy assessment of IRTs. Furthermore, our results indicate that calibration approaches providing the highest clinical accuracy in the 37–38.5 °C range may be most effective for measuring EBT. While device performance depends on many factors, IRTs can provide superior performance to NCITs.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,396,2021,2021-12-29 00:00:00,28,68,"Quanzeng Wang, Yangling Zhou, Pejman Ghassemi, David McBride, J.

This present study aimed to investigate the association between stress hyperglycemia and SAP. Methods Patients were screened between February 2013 and August 2020 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. We divided the blood glucose of the patients at admission by the glycated hemoglobin to calculate the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between SAP and SHR, with the confounders being controlled. Further, subgroup analyses were separately performed for stroke patients with and without diabetes. Results A total of 2,039 patients were finally recruited, of which 533 (26.14%) were diagnosed with SAP. SHR were divided into four quartiles in the logistic regression analysis, the highest SHR quartile (SHR ≥ 1.15) indicated a higher risk of SAP (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.13–2.19, p = 0.01) in total patients. In patients without diabetes, the third quantile (SHR = 0.96–1.14) and the highest quantile (SHR ≥ 1.15) were both related to a higher risk of SAP (both p < 0.05).

Methods We included 205 patients with HCI from November 2018 to December 2019. The diagnostic criterion for SAP was occurrence within 7 days of the onset of stroke. Poor outcome was defined as a functional outcome based on a 3-months MRS score >3. The relationship of demographic, laboratory and neuroimaging variables with SAP and poor outcome was investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Fifty seven (27.8%) patients were diagnosed with SAP and 40 (19.5%) developed poor outcomes. A2DS2 score (OR = 1.284; 95% CI: 1.048–1.574; P = 0.016), previous stroke (OR = 2.630; 95% CI: 1.122–6.163; P = 0.026), consciousness (OR = 2.945; 95% CI: 1.514–5.729; P < 0.001), brain atrophy (OR = 1.427; 95% CI: 1.040–1.959; P = 0.028), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.715; 95% CI: 1.163–2.528; P = 0.006) were independently associated with the occurrence of SAP. Therefore, we combined these variables into a new SAP prediction model with the C-statistic of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78–0.90). Fasting plasma glucose (OR = 1.404; 95% CI: 1.202–1.640; P < 0.001), NIHSS score (OR = 1.088; 95% CI: 1.010–1.172; P = 0.026), previous stroke (OR = 4.333; 95% CI: 1.645–11.418; P = 0.003), SAP (OR = 3.420; 95% CI: 1.332–8.787; P = 0.011), basal ganglia-dilated perivascular spaces (BG-dPVS) (OR = 2.124; 95% CI: 1.313–3.436; P = 0.002), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.680; 95% CI: 1.166–2.420; P = 0.005) were independently associated with poor outcome. The C-statistic of the outcome model was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81–0.94). Furthermore, the SAP model significantly improved discrimination and net benefit more than the A2DS2 scale, with a C-statistic of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.83). Conclusions After the addition of neuroimaging features, the models exhibit good differentiation and calibration for the prediction of the occurrence of SAP and the development of poor outcomes in HCI patients. The SAP model could better predict the SAP, representing a helpful and valid tool to obtain a net benefit compared with the A2DS2 scale.",Frontiers in Neurology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3513ce18-3757-4358-b15f-7060af98e6d0,Frontiers in Neurology,,13,N/A,2022,2022-02-04 00:00:00,6,63,"Yaoyao Yu, Tianyi Xia, Zhouli Tan, Huwei Xia, Shenping He, Han Sun, Xifan Wang, Haolan Song, Weijian Chen","2129418111, 1651654814, 2152252911, 2152252251, 2154572155, 2143527495, 2155087662, 2122643023, 1944459462",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30fd98944b72c8e5e86cd6dea2aa1aff7607a38b,Medicine,2129418111

Purpose: To determine the microbiology and outcomes of SAP in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) for patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: In this observational study, included patients were divided into SAP and non-SAP based on a comprehensive analysis of symptom, imaging, and laboratory results. Baseline characteristics, clinical characteristics, microbiology, and outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: Of 200 patients, 42.5% developed SAP after the onset of stroke, and they had a lower proportion of non-smokers (p = 0.002), lower GCS score (p < 0.001), higher serum CRP (p < 0.001) at ICU admission, and a higher proportion of males (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.039) than patients with non-SAP. Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (78.8%), followed by Gram-positive aerobic cocci (29.4%). The main pathogens included K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Burkholderia cepacia. SAP prolonged length of MV (p < 0.001), duration of ICU stay (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p = 0.027), shortened MV-free days by 28 (p < 0.001), and caused elevated vasopressor application (p = 0.001) and 60-day mortality (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis suggested that patients with coma (p < 0.001) have a higher risk of developing SAP. Conclusion: The microbiology of SAP is similar to early phase of HAP and VAP. SAP prolongs the duration of MV and length of ICU and hospital stays, but also markedly increases 60-day mortality.",Frontiers in Microbiology,journal,,25a655e4-17da-4bfc-a246-5cd20202068d,Frontiers in Microbiology,,12,N/A,2021,2021-12-03 00:00:00,12,51,"Jie Zhao, Lei-qing Li, Ning Zhen, L.

Based on extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (xDLVO) theory, the major fouling mechanisms, i.e., Lifshitz–van der Waals (LW), electrostatic (EL), and acid–base (AB) interactions, were for the first time quantitatively analyzed for model HA–bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures at different solution conditions. Results indicated that the pH, ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration of the solution significantly affected the physicochemical properties and the interaction energy between the polyethersulfone (PES) membrane and HA–BSA mixtures. The free energy of cohesion of the HA–BSA mixtures was minimum at pH = 3.0, ionic strength = 100 mM, and c(Ca2+) = 1.0 mM. The AB interaction energy was a key contributor to the total interaction energy when the separation distance between the membrane surface and HA–BSA mixtures was less than 3 nm, while the influence of EL interaction energy was of less importance to the total interaction energy. The attractive interaction energies of membrane–foulant and foulant–foulant increased at low pH, high ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration, thus aggravating membrane fouling, which was supported by the fouling experimental results. The obtained findings would provide valuable insights for the quantitative understanding of membrane fouling mechanisms of mixed organics during MF.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2018,2018-09-22 00:00:00,14,49,"Chunyi Sun, N.

The increase in produced water stresses the currently deployed deoiling technologies, resulting in more oil in the discharged water. Deploying membrane filtration to reduce the hydrocarbon concentration inherits additional complications related to fouling of the membranes: A process where the accumulation of material within and on the membrane surface adds additional flow resistance. This paper reviews and analyses the fouling detection, removal, prevention, dynamical and static modeling, with emphasis on how the membrane process can be manipulated from a process control perspective. The majority of the models rely on static descriptions or are limited to a narrow range of operating conditions which limits the usability of the models. This paper concludes that although the membrane filtration has been successfully applied and matured in many other industrial areas, challenges regarding cost-effective mitigation of fouling in the offshore deoiling applications, still exist. Fouling-based modeling combined with online parameter identification could potentially expand the operating range of the models and facilitate advanced control design to address transient performance and scheduling of fouling removal methods, resulting in cost-effective operation of membrane filtration systems. With the benefits of membrane filtration, it is predicted that membrane technology will be incorporated in produced water treatment, if the zero-discharge policies are enforced globally.",Water,journal,['Review'],2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2018,2018-06-26 00:00:00,110,139,"Kasper L.

The failed unit is repaired either by an in-house repairer within an exponential patience time T or by an external expert who works faster but charges more. When there are two repair facilities, we allow the regular repairer to begin repair or to continue repair beyond T if the expert is busy. Two models arise accordingly as the expert repairs one or all failed units during each visit. We show that (1) adding a second spare to a one-unit system already backed by a spare raises A∞ as well as ω; (2) thereafter, adding a second repair facility improves both criteria further.

The goal of this study is to create a forecasting workflow that increases prediction accuracy independent of the machine learning method and has minimal computational requirements. The proposed trend decomposition method incorporates irradiance and seasonal features as exogenous inputs. In order to extract the linear part of the data, a moving average filter is used. The nonlinear (stable) component of the time series is then calculated by subtracting this linear part from the original data. The stable portion is modeled using several machine learning methods, while the ordinary least squares method is applied to the linear series. By aggregating both results, the final forecast is obtained. The forecasting performances of the machine learning algorithms on unprocessed data are used as baselines for evaluations. Improvements up to 39% in the mean absolute error and up to 31% in the root mean square error metrics are observed compared to the baselines. Experimental results show that the proposed trend decomposition with extrapolation method increases the forecasting performance and generalization capacity of machine learning algorithms.",Energy Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],d757e504-289c-4242-967d-647bd71c352f,Energy Technology,,,N/A,2023,2023-12-09 00:00:00,5,23,"Gurcan Kavakci, Begum Cicekdag, S.

The difficulty of creating a yield forecast system is in the correct choice of predictors that have the greatest impact on yield.
To build the model, moisture in the 100 cm layer of the soil, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, humus, and soil acidity in the soil were used as input parameters. The amount of precipitation over 4 months, the average air temperature for the same period, as well as the presence of diseases, pests, and weeds were also taken into consideration. Data on 13 districts of the North Kazakhstan region in the period from 2008 to 2017 were used. The output parameter was the yield of spring wheat over the same time period.
The relative importance of input variables in relation to the output variable was used to determine the weight values of input variables.
An artificial neural network of error backpropagation was used as a method. The advantage of this method is that the quality of the forecast increases with a large amount of training data, as well as the ability to model nonlinear relationships between different data sources.
After training the artificial neural network and obtaining predictive data, good results were achieved for predicting wheat yields (p=0.52, mean absolute error in percentage (MAPE)=12.02 %, root mean square error (RMSE)=3.368).
Thus, it is assumed that the developed model for forecasting wheat yields based on data can be easily adapted for other crops and places and will allow the adoption of the right strategies to ensure food security",Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,journal,,405a8682-2b02-472d-9d89-0115f4e329bc,Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-30 00:00:00,12,59,"Gailya Aubakirova, V.

Systems require high accuracy, low cost, and low computational complexity prediction methods. Although exponential smoothing is an effective method, there is a lack of use with cellular networks and research on data traffic. The accuracy and suitability of this method need to be evaluated using several types of traffic. Thus, this study introduces the application of exponential smoothing as a method of adaptive forecasting of cellular network traffic for cases of voice (in Erlang) and data (in megabytes or gigabytes). Simple and Error, Trend, Seasonal (ETS) methods are used for exponential smoothing. By investigating the effect of their smoothing factors in describing cellular network traffic, the accuracy of forecast using each method is evaluated. This research comprises a comprehensive analysis approach using multiple case study comparisons to determine the best fit model. Different exponential smoothing models are evaluated for various traffic types in different time scales. The experiments are implemented on real data from a commercial cellular network, which is divided into a training data part for modeling and test data part for forecasting comparison. This study found that ETS framework is not suitable for hourly voice traffic, but it provides nearly the same results with Holt–Winter’s multiplicative seasonal (HWMS) in both cases of daily voice and data traffic. HWMS is presumably encompassed by ETC framework and shows good results in all cases of traffic. Therefore, HWMS is recommended for cellular network traffic prediction due to its simplicity and high accuracy.  ",Journal of Information and Communication Technologies,journal,,8647ec57-7e23-4bf6-8daf-83a8b917e700,Journal of Information and Communication Technology,,,N/A,2018,2018-12-11 00:00:00,24,14,"Quang Thanh Tran, Li Hao, Q.

The impact of the analyzed solutions was evaluated on the basis of model tests carried out in laboratory conditions. For the needs of the planned tests, a reverberation chamber was appropriately modified, ensuring in it the so-called free field conditions. On such a research stand, the propagation of sound wave was investigated as a function of distance, at different heights, for situations without the acoustic screen and after its installation, testing various solutions on its upper edge. On the basis of the conducted tests, the shielding effectiveness of the analyzed test samples was determined. In the second part of the article, a computational model was made, which corresponded to laboratory conditions so that it was possible to carry out the simulation of acoustic field distribution in the same configuration as in the laboratory tests.

Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],2ca4279c-8ed7-4280-8022-09e577923a09,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,14,N/A,2020,2020-05-13 00:00:00,228,78,"Dan Pan, An Zeng, L.

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling chemistry at unprecedented computational speeds given accurate reference data. However, certain tasks, such as charge assignment, do not have a unique solution. Herein, we use a machine learning algorithm to discover a new charge assignment model by learning to replicate molecular dipole moments across a large, diverse set of nonequilibrium conformations of molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms. The new model, called Affordable Charge Assignment (ACA), is computationally inexpensive and predicts dipoles of out-of-sample molecules accurately. Furthermore, dipole-inferred ACA charges are transferable to dipole and even quadrupole moments of much larger molecules than those used for training. We apply ACA to dynamical trajectories of biomolecules and produce their infrared spectra. Additionally, we find that ACA assigns similar charges to Charge Model 5 but with greatly reduced computational cost.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,journal,['JournalArticle'],45c7ef3c-e436-428b-a856-c8d5b31b603b,The journal of physical chemistry letters,"

However, due to novel language and the rapid change of information, existing misinformation detection datasets are not effective for evaluating systems designed to detect misin-formation on this topic. Misinformation detection can be divided into two sub-tasks: (i) retrieval of misconceptions relevant to posts being checked for veracity, and (ii) stance detection to identify whether the posts Agree , Dis-agree , or express No Stance towards the retrieved misconceptions. To facilitate research on this task, we release C OVID L IES 1 , a dataset of 6761 expert-annotated tweets to evaluate the performance of misinformation detection systems on 86 different pieces of COVID-19 related misinformation.

However, its specific pathogenesis has not been clarified. This study aimed to identify biomarkers for OA diagnosis and elucidate their potential mechanisms for restoring OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis in vitro. Material and methods Two publicly available transcriptomic mRNA OA-related datasets (GSE10575 and GSE51588) were explored for biomarker identification by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). We applied the GSE32317 and GSE55457 cohorts to validate the markers’ efficacy for diagnosis. The connections of markers to chondrocyte autophagy and apoptosis in OA were also comprehensively explored in vitro using molecular biology approaches, including qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results We identified 286 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were enriched in the ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. After external cohort validation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, PDK1 was finally identified as a diagnostic marker for OA. The pharmacological properties of BX795-downregulated PDK1 expression inhibited LPS-induced chondrocyte inflammation and apoptosis and rescued OA-dysregulated autophagy. Additionally, the phosphorylation of the mediators associated with the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways was significantly downregulated, indicating the regulatory function of PDK1 in apoptosis and autophagy via MAPK and PI3K/AKT-associated signaling pathways in chondrocytes. A significantly positive association between the PDK1 expression and Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Plasma cells, and activated CD4 memory T cells, as well as an evident negative correlation between T cells follicular helper and CD4 naive T cells, were detected in the immune cell infiltration analysis. Conclusions PDK1 can be used as a diagnostic marker for OA. Inhibition of its expression can rescue OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibit apoptosis by reducing the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,13,N/A,2023,2023-01-06 00:00:00,11,43,"Jinzhi Meng, Huawei Du, Haiyuan Lv, Jinfeng Lu, Jia Li, Jun Yao","2153309361, 2199519898, 2140466182, 2115405513, 2118372427, 2109801692",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12d9dc29928fff4157ad8c3bdb56a6f263914743,"Biology, Medicine",2153309361

In recent years, some studies have shown that the pathological process of OA chondrocytes is related to ferroptosis. Our study aims to identify and validate differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) in OA chondrocytes and to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms. RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by four methods: limma-voom, edgeR, DESeq2, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interactions (PPI), and cytoHubba of Cytoscape were applied to identify hub genes. Clinical OA cartilage specimens were collected for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting (WB), histological staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and transfection. Sankey diagram was used to visualize the relationships between the expression level of SLC3A2 in the damaged area and clinical factors. Based on bioinformatics analysis, clinical factors, and experiment validation, SLC3A2 was identified as a hub gene. It was down-regulated in OA cartilage compared to normal cartilage (p < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that SLC3A2 was associated with ferroptosis-related functions. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression level of SLC3A2 in the OA cartilage-damaged area was closely related to BMI, obesity grade, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Furthermore, in vitro experiments validated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. In summary, we demonstrated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. These findings provide a new idea for the study of the pathogenesis of OA, thus providing new means for the clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy of OA.",Cells,journal,['JournalArticle'],51278f27-cfdd-4938-81e4-9d54ca7b3cd0,Cells,,11,N/A,2022,2022-10-30 00:00:00,33,40,"Hailong Liu, Zengfa Deng, Baoxi Yu, Hui Liu, Zhijian Yang, Anyu Zeng, M.

The incidence of OA is rising because of the ageing population and the epidemic of obesity. This research was designed for the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers for OA and analyzing the possible association between critical genes and infiltrated immune cells. 10 OA samples from patients with spinal OA and 10 normal samples were collected. GSE55235 and GSE55457 datasets including human OA and normal samples were downloaded from the GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between 20 OA and 20 controls. SVM-RFE analysis and LASSO regression model were carried out to screen possible markers. The compositional patterns of the 22 types of immune cell fraction in OA were determined by the use of CIBERSORT. The expression level of the biomarkers in OA was examined by the use of RT-PCR. In this study, an overall 44 DEGs were identified: 18 genes were remarkably upregulated and 26 genes were distinctly downregulated. KEGG pathway analyses revealed that pathways were significantly enriched including IL-17 signal path, rheumatoid arthritis, TNF signal path, and lipid and atherosclerosis. Based on the results of machine learning, we identified APOLD1 and EPYC as critical diagnostic genes in OA, which were further confirmed using ROC assays. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that APOLD1 was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Moreover, we found that EPYC was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Overall, our findings might provide some novel clue for the exploration of novel markers for OA diagnosis.

Existing studies have established the superiority of the artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms in this field. However, more recent studies have demonstrated promising PV solar power output forecasting performances by the decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Therefore, the present study aims to address a research gap in this field by determining the best performer among these 5 algorithms. A data set from the United States’ National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) consisting of weather parameters and solar power output data for a monocrystalline silicon PV module in Cocoa, Florida was utilized. Comparisons of forecasting scores show that the ANN algorithm is superior as the ANN16 model produces the best mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2) with values of 0.4693, 0.8816 W, and 0.9988, respectively.

The proliferation of data obtained from site investigations and data acquisition systems provides an opportunity for the application of machine learning (ML) techniques. ML algorithms have been successfully applied in TBM tunnelling because they are particularly effective in capturing complex, non-linear relationships. This study focuses on commonly used ML techniques for TBM tunnelling, with a particular emphasis on data processing, algorithms, optimisation techniques, and evaluation metrics. The primary concerns in TBM applications are discussed, including predicting TBM performance, predicting surface settlement, and time series forecasting. This study reviews the current progress, identifies the challenges, and suggests future developments in the field of intelligent TBM tunnelling construction.

It is important to study the urban haze risk assessment to manage the haze disaster. The haze risk assessment indexes of 11 cities in Fenwei Plain were selected from three aspects: the sensitivity of disaster-inducing environments, haze component hazards and the vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies, combined with regional disaster system theory. The haze hazard risk levels of 11 cities in Fenwei Plain were evaluated using the matter-element extension (MEE) model, and the indicator weights were determined by improving the principal component analysis (PCA) method using the entropy weight method, and finally, five haze hazard risk assessment models were established by improving the particle swarm optimization (IPSO) light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithm. It is used to assess the risk of affected populations, transportation damage risk, crop damage area risk, direct economic loss risk and comprehensive disaster risk before a disaster event occurs. The experimental comparison shows that the haze risk index of Xi’an city is the highest, and the full index can improve the evaluation accuracy by 4–16% compared with only the causative factor index, which indicates that the proposed PCA-MEE-ISPO-LightGBM model evaluation results are more realistic and reliable.",Syst.,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Syst.,263,10,Unknown,2022,2022-12-19 00:00:00,37,48,"Hongbin Dai, Guang-qiu Huang, Huibin Zeng, Rongchuan Yu","2151250109, 2015075, 2041306548, 2197278898",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e6b1ac5308f74abf5d3e09a490fae929ebd2c0e,"Computer Science, Environmental Science",2151250109

Artificial intelligence is a multidimensional technology with various components such as advanced algorithms, ML and DL. Together, AI, ML, and DL are expected to provide automated devices to ophthalmologists for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders in the near future. In fact, AI, ML, and DL have been used in ophthalmic setting to validate the diagnosis of diseases, read images, perform corneal topographic mapping and intraocular lens calculations. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the 3 most common causes of irreversible blindness on a global scale. Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively detect the progression of a number of pathologies including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders. There are 2 methods of imaging used as diagnostic methods in ophthalmic practice: fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Of note, OCT has become the most widely used imaging modality in ophthalmology settings in the developed world. Changes in population demographics and lifestyle, extension of average lifespan, and the changing pattern of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, DR, AMD, and glaucoma create a rising demand for such images. Furthermore, the limitation of availability of retina specialists and trained human graders is a major problem in many countries. Consequently, given the current population growth trends, it is inevitable that analyzing such images is time‐consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Therefore, the detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders through unmanned automated applications system in the near future will be inevitable. We provide an overview of the potential impact of the current AI, ML, and DL methods and their applications on the early detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic diseases.",Asia - Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology,Unknown,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",Unknown,Asia-Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology,264–272,8,Unknown,2019,2019-06-01 00:00:00,172,94,"L.

Genetic programming (GP) has been used to develop five models for the prediction of pavement distress: Model 1 for the cracking progression, Model 2 for the ravelling progression, Model 3 for the pothole progression, Model 4 for the rutting progression, and Model 5 for the roughness progression. The data have been collected from the roads of Patiala City, Punjab, India; during the years 2012–2015, the network of 16 roads have been selected for the data collection purposes. The data have been divided into two sets, that is, training dataset (data collected during the years 2012 and 2013) and validation dataset (data collected during the years 2014 and 2015). The two fitness functions have been used for the evaluation of the models, that is, coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE), and it is inferred that GP models predict with high accuracy for pavement distress and help the decision makers for adequate and timely fund allocations for preservation of the urban road network.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Advances in Civil Engineering,1-15,2018,Unknown,2018,2018-03-29 00:00:00,29,34,"T.

While shock tube testing has filled some of the data gap by replicating blast waves in a controlled fashion, there is only scant field explosion data that is easily accessible for the structural engineering community for hypothesis testing or model validation. This paper summarizes experimental design, pre-test sensor verification, and data collection from 10 reinforced concrete slabs subjected to field explosions using a modest budget. The experimental record contains pressure, displacement, and acceleration measurements of each slab except in a few cases where the sensors have failed. The data is archived at George Mason Dataverse.

We used extensive, empirically-driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests, and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency <10% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with ≥80% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies >25%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called “Winner’s Curse”, was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) which led to more accurate effect size estimation. These insights provide a foundation for future eQTL studies, especially those with sampling constraints and subtly different conditions.",bioRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,Nucleic Acids Research,e133 - e133,46,N/A,2017,2017-10-25 00:00:00,108,57,"Q.

8932f29b432ca127ce0df3469b6e67990deb9a1f,10.1101/208447,Genetics of trans-regulatory variation in gene expression,"Heritable variation in gene expression provides a critical bridge between differences in genome sequence and the biology of many traits, including common human diseases. However, the sources of most regulatory genetic variation remain unknown. Here, we used transcriptome profiling in 1,012 yeast segregants to map the genetic basis of variation in gene expression with high statistical power. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that together account for over 70% of the total genetic contribution to variation in mRNA levels, allowing us to examine the sources of regulatory variation comprehensively. We found that variation in the expression of a typical gene has a complex genetic architecture involving multiple eQTL. We also detected hundreds of eQTL pairs with significant non-additive interactions in an unbiased genome-wide scan. Although most genes were influenced by a local eQTL located close to the gene, most expression variation arose from distant, trans-acting eQTL located far from their target genes. Nearly all distant eQTL clustered at 102 “hotspot” locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes and altered expression of their target genes though both direct and indirect mechanisms. Many local eQTL had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in trans. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.",bioRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,eLife,,7,N/A,2017,2017-10-24 00:00:00,134,127,"F.

Institutions are working hard primarily for their survival and gradually for their stability and long-run businesses for the future. The education and training existing in urban areas and it is in rural areas differ in many respects. Technical Education in urban areas and it is in rural as well as remote rural has diversified thoughts in terms of enrollment issues of the students. It is urgent to know the interests of the students and participants, as well as why and how they are attracted to go for technical education or the general stream in the community. It is realized that there are relatively not only fewer students but also a smaller proportion of students in the enrollment. It seems like there are various areas that the current government should focus on for the sake of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) development regarding the enrollment issues in the Technical Education in Community Schools (TECS) modality program. The number of TECS modalities accredited is increasing trend in the country, but it is not realized as it should be by enrolling a higher number of students each year in multiple folds. Or the students are becoming self-driven, having their core interest to enroll for the course.

There is, however, still a dearth of study about whether graduate students acquire the employability skills that businesses want of them because of their higher education. To determine a student's future employment and career path, it is critical to evaluate their soft skills. An emerging area called educational data mining (EDM) aims to gather enormous volumes of academic data produced and maintained by educational institutions and to derive explicit and specific information from it. This paper aims to predict students' soft skills such as professional, analytical, linguistic, communication, and ethical skills, based on their socio-economic, academic, and institutional data by leveraging data mining methods and machine learning techniques. All five soft skills were predicted using prediction models created using linear regression, probabilistic neural networks, and simple regression tree techniques. This study used a dataset from an open source that Universidad Technologica de Bolivar published. It covers academic, social, and economic data for 12,411 students. The experimental results demonstrated that the linear regression algorithm performed better than the others in predicting all five soft skills compared to machine learning methods. This finding can assist higher education institutions in making informed decisions, providing tailored support, enhancing student success and employability, and continuously modifying their programs to meet the needs of students.",JOIV: International Journal on Informatics Visualization,journal,['JournalArticle'],0fa5fb50-57a4-4633-aa8f-91804e20ac17,JOIV : International Journal on Informatics Visualization,,,N/A,2023,2023-11-30 00:00:00,2,0,"Rathimala Kannan, Chew Chin Jet, Kannan Ramakrishnan, Sujatha Ramdass","2066417170, 2276693112, 26945108, 2276696902",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e43ff4d7efb4a5216f20ed5acb57929a97c759ae,"Computer Science, Economics, Education",2066417170

To predict students' employability before graduation, machine learning models were employed. These include logistic regression; decision tree, random forest, and an unsupervised clustering (K-Means) algorithm. This research, therefore, aims to predict the full-time employability of undergraduate students based on academic and experience employability attributes – including cumulative grade point average (CGPA), student industrial work experience scheme (SIWES), co-curricular activities, gender, and union groupings before graduation. Primary datasets of 218 graduate students in the last four academic calendar years (2016 – 2021) from the Computer Science Department of Federal University Dutse were rated. The results demonstrate that Random Forest Classifier predict students employability the best with an accuracy of 98% and f1-score of 0.99 compare to logistic regression and decision tree. Furthermore, using more students’ data with more attributes including academics and extracurricular activities can improve the models performance and predict students’ employability.  ",UMYU Scientifica,Unknown,,Unknown,UMYU Scientifica,,,Unknown,2023,2023-02-13 00:00:00,8,0,"Muhammad Hadiza Baffa, Muhammad Abubakar Miyim, Abdullahi Sani Dauda","2206579178, 2206591424, 2206417094",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a7d0d30cfaef2f7d43e229b49e89d53877a10e9,"Computer Science, Education",2206579178

It is particularly difficult for governments in low-income countries, where informal industry is responsible for a large amount of pollution, because the governments lack the ability to locate and monitor large numbers of dispersed polluters. This study demonstrates an accurate, scalable machine-learning approach for identifying brick kilns, a highly polluting informal industry in Bangladesh, in satellite imagery. Our data reveal widespread violations of the national regulations governing brick manufacturing, which has implications for the health and well-being of the country. Our approach offers a low-cost, replicable method for regulatory agencies to generate information on key pollution sources. Improving compliance with environmental regulations is critical for promoting clean environments and healthy populations. In South Asia, brick manufacturing is a major source of pollution but is dominated by small-scale, informal producers who are difficult to monitor and regulate—a common challenge in low-income settings. We demonstrate a low-cost, scalable approach for locating brick kilns in high-resolution satellite imagery from Bangladesh. Our approach identifies kilns with 94.2% accuracy and 88.7% precision and extracts the precise GPS coordinates of every brick kiln across Bangladesh. Using these estimates, we show that at least 12% of the population of Bangladesh (>18 million people) live within 1 km of a kiln and that 77% and 9% of kilns are (illegally) within 1 km of schools and health facilities, respectively. Finally, we show how kilns contribute up to 20.4 μg/m3 of PM2.5 (particulate matter of a diameter less than 2.5 μm) in Dhaka when the wind blows from an unfavorable direction. We document inaccuracies and potential bias with respect to local regulations in the government data.

Until recently, its extent was poorly understood and no tools existed for systematically detecting forced labor risk on individual fishing vessels on a global scale. Here we use satellite data and machine learning to identify these high-risk vessels and find widespread risk of forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet. This information provides new opportunities for unique market, enforcement, and policy interventions. This also provides a proof of concept for how remotely sensed dynamic individual behavior can be used to infer forced labor abuses. While forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet has been widely documented, its extent remains unknown. No methods previously existed for remotely identifying individual fishing vessels potentially engaged in these abuses on a global scale. By combining expertise from human rights practitioners and satellite vessel monitoring data, we show that vessels reported to use forced labor behave in systematically different ways from other vessels. We exploit this insight by using machine learning to identify high-risk vessels from among 16,000 industrial longliner, squid jigger, and trawler fishing vessels. Our model reveals that between 14% and 26% of vessels were high-risk, and also reveals patterns of where these vessels fished and which ports they visited. Between 57,000 and 100,000 individuals worked on these vessels, many of whom may have been forced labor victims. This information provides unprecedented opportunities for novel interventions to combat this humanitarian tragedy.

Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activities in rural and remote locations may provide heightened opportunities to conceal the alleged human rights violations associated with mining, such as: hazardous working conditions, health impacts, child labour, child trafficking, and debt bondage. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method, teamed with high temporal frequency Sentinel-1 imagery, for monitoring ASM activity in rural locations of the “Copperbelt”, the DRC. The results show that the ISBAS descriptive variables (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) were significantly different (p-value = ≤ 0.05) between mining and non-mining areas. Additionally, a significant difference was found for the ISBAS descriptive variables mean, standard deviation, and minimum between the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnels). As expected, a high level of subsidence (i.e., negative ISBAS pixel value) was a clear indicator of mine activity. Trial activity thresholds were set for the descriptive variables mean (-2.43 mm/yr) and minimum (-5.36 mm/yr) to explore an ISBAS approach to active mine identification. The study concluded that the ISBAS method has great potential as a monitoring tool for ASM, with the ability to separate mining and non-mining areas based on surface motion values, and further distinguish the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnel). Ground data collection and further development of ISBAS analysis needs to be made to fully understand the value of an ISBAS-based ASM monitoring system.

Recycling the world’s increasing debris has taken on critical importance. Pyrolysis is one of the most practical techniques for recycling plastic because of its intrinsic qualities and environmental friendliness. For scale-up and reactor design, an understanding of the degradation process is essential. Using one model-free kinetic approach (Friedman) and two model-fitting kinetic methods (Arrhenius and Coats-Redfern), the thermal degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) microplastics at heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 °C/min was examined in this work. Additionally, a powerful artificial neural network (ANN) model was created to forecast the heat deterioration of PET MPs. At various heating rates, the TG and DTG thermograms from the PET MPs degradation revealed the same patterns and trends. This showed that the heating rates do not impact the decomposition processes. The Friedman model showed activation energy values ranging from 3.31 to 8.79 kJ/mol. The average activation energy value was 1278.88 kJ/mol from the Arrhenius model, while, from the Coats-Redfern model, the average was 1.05 × 104 kJ/mol. The thermodynamics of the degradation process of the PET MPs by thermal treatment were all non-spontaneous and endergonic, and energy was absorbed for the degradation. It was discovered that an ANN, with a two-layer hidden architecture, was the most effective network for predicting the output variable (mass loss%) with a regression coefficient value of (0.951–1.0).",Processes,,,939ba3df-4270-4ba0-ad98-ffe889f3546e,Processes,,,Unknown,2023,2023-02-07 00:00:00,24,33,"T.

The present study focuses on the identification, characterization, and quantification techniques for tracking microplastics. Due to their unique compositional structure, unambiguous identification of individual polymers in various plastic samples, usually comprised of mixtures of individual polymers, remains a challenge. Therefore, there is limited research on the pyrolysis characterization of mixed samples. In this study, two analytical methods, TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS combined with thermogravimetric analysis were used to evaluate the thermal-degradation process of individual and mixed samples of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The primary interaction was the volatilization of terephthalic acid bound to chlorine molecules. The reduction of vinyl-ester functional groups and aromatic hydrocarbon intermediates related to olefin branching was confirmed. Char formation was increased, due to aromatic compounds from PET and PVC. All of the polymers used in the study may be underestimated in quantity, due to combined volatilizations during pyrolysis. TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS showed forceful advantages in identifying mixed microplastics through different discrimination mechanisms. The study provides deep insight into pyrolysis behaviors and the interactions of mixed polymers, and the obtained results can help better comprehend the complex pyrolysis process.",Polymers,journal,['JournalArticle'],4efb9ad7-9740-4922-b9c8-c29376ca2223,Polymers,,15,N/A,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,20,59,"M.

It is detected by trained microscopists who analyze microscopic blood smear images. Modern deep learning techniques may be used to do this analysis automatically. The need for the trained personnel can be greatly reduced with the development of an automatic accurate and efficient model. In this article, we propose an entirely automated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for the diagnosis of malaria from the microscopic blood smear images. A variety of techniques including knowledge distillation, data augmentation, Autoencoder, feature extraction by a CNN model and classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are performed under three training procedures named general training, distillation training and autoencoder training to optimize and improve the model accuracy and inference performance. Our deep learning-based model can detect malarial parasites from microscopic images with an accuracy of 99.23% while requiring just over 4600 floating point operations. For practical validation of model efficiency, we have deployed the miniaturized model in different mobile phones and a server-backed web application. Data gathered from these environments show that the model can be used to perform inference under 1 s per sample in both offline (mobile only) and online (web application) mode, thus engendering confidence that such models may be deployed for efficient practical inferential systems.",Diagnostics,,['JournalArticle'],1944b6e1-2c1d-4f42-88e3-9f8a52f57e47,Diagnostics,,10,Unknown,2020,2020-05-01 00:00:00,117,80,"K.

However, the application of convolutional networks has been proposed only very recently and has remained largely unexplored. In this paper we describe a convolutional neural network architecture for functional connectome classification called connectome-convolutional neural network (CCNN). Our results on simulated datasets and a publicly available dataset for amnestic mild cognitive impairment classification demonstrate that our CCNN model can efficiently distinguish between subject groups. We also show that the connectome-convolutional network is capable to combine information from diverse functional connectivity metrics and that models using a combination of different connectivity descriptors are able to outperform classifiers using only one metric. From this flexibility follows that our proposed CCNN model can be easily adapted to a wide range of connectome based classification or regression tasks, by varying which connectivity descriptor combinations are used to train the network.",Front.

However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions. Method: First, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of AD subjects. Coefficients of MIE with values higher than 0.98 quantile were highlighted to obtain the discriminant regions that distinguish AD from NC. Results: The experiments showed that the proposed method can predict AD subjects with a competitive performance with existing methods, especially the accuracy of the polynomial kernel (92.36 ± 0.94) was better than the linear kernel of 91.47 ± 1.02 and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of 86.71 ± 1.93. The proposed eigenbrain-based CAD system detected 30 AD-related brain regions (Anterior Cingulate, Caudate Nucleus, Cerebellum, Cingulate Gyrus, Claustrum, Inferior Frontal Gyrus, Inferior Parietal Lobule, Insula, Lateral Ventricle, Lentiform Nucleus, Lingual Gyrus, Medial Frontal Gyrus, Middle Frontal Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Paracentral Lobule, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Postcentral Gyrus, Posterial Cingulate, Precentral Gyrus, Precuneus, Subcallosal Gyrus, Sub-Gyral, Superior Frontal Gyrus, Superior Parietal Lobule, Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, Thalamus, Transverse Temporal Gyrus, and Uncus). The results were coherent with existing literatures.

The above problems mean that the manufacturing industry knowledge utilization rate is low. This paper proposes a novel Chinese fine-grained NER (named entity recognition) method based on symmetry lightweight deep multinetwork collaboration (ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF) and model transfer considering active learning (MTAL) to research fine-grained named entity recognition of a few labeled Chinese textual data types. The method is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF was applied for verification in the CLUENER2020 dataset (Public dataset) to get a pretrained model; the experiments show that the model obtains an F1 score of 0.8962, which is better than the best baseline algorithm, an improvement of 9.2%. In the second stage, the pretrained model was transferred into the Manufacturing-NER dataset (our dataset), and we used the active learning strategy to optimize the model effect. The final F1 result of Manufacturing-NER was 0.8931 after the model transfer (it was higher than 0.8576 before the model transfer); so, this method represents an improvement of 3.55%. Our method effectively transfers the existing knowledge from public source data to scientific target data, solving the problem of named entity recognition with scarce labeled domain data, and proves its effectiveness.",Symmetry,journal,['JournalArticle'],1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,1986,12,N/A,2020,2020-11-30 00:00:00,20,48,"Liguo Yao, Haisong Huang, Kuan-Wei Wang, Shih-Huan Chen, Qiaoqiao Xiong","113765846, 2899585, 3723159, 153064823, 2041658772",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53d1c4cce25c5d9f74b0c1c8a32341e69752ebfe,"Computer Science, Engineering",113765846

The recognition of named entities based on Chinese is more complicated and difficult than English, which makes the task of NER in Chinese more challenging. In particular, fine-grained named entity recognition is more challenging than traditional named entity recognition tasks, mainly because fine-grained tasks have higher requirements for the ability of automatic feature extraction and information representation of deep neural models. In this paper, we propose an innovative neural network model named En2BiLSTM-CRF to improve the effect of fine-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks. This proposed model including the initial encoding layer, the enhanced encoding layer, and the decoding layer combines the advantages of pre-training model encoding, dual bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and a residual connection mechanism. Hence, it can encode information multiple times and extract contextual features hierarchically. We conducted sufficient experiments on two representative datasets using multiple important metrics and compared them with other advanced baselines. We present promising results showing that our proposed En2BiLSTM-CRF has better performance as well as better generalization ability in both fine-grained and coarse-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2020,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,45,"Jingang Liu, Chunhe Xia, Haihua Yan, Wenjing Xu","49721680, 2056988799, 48506966, 2152921552",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9e45d4a6b3de0186e2cb430ecf01dcf17697342,Computer Science,49721680

Named entity recognition is a natural language processing task carried out to obtain morpheme sequences with specific meanings, such as person, location, and organization names. Although morphological analysis and named entity recognition are closely associated with each other, they have been independently studied and have exhibited the inevitable error propagation problem. Hence, we propose an integrated model based on label attention networks that simultaneously performs morphological analysis and named entity recognition. The proposed model comprises two layers of neural network models that are closely associated with each other. The lower layer performs a morphological analysis, whereas the upper layer performs a named entity recognition. In our experiments using a public gold-labeled dataset, the proposed model outperformed previous state-of-the-art models used for morphological analysis and named entity recognition. Furthermore, the results indicated that the integrated architecture could alleviate the error propagation problem.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2020,2020-05-28 00:00:00,5,19,"Hongjin Kim, H.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has shown promising performance in tackling feature selection problems, but still faces challenges in dealing with large-scale feature selection in Big Data environment because of the large search space. Hence, this article proposes a bi-directional feature fixation (BDFF) framework for PSO and provides a novel idea to reduce the search space in large-scale feature selection. BDFF uses two opposite search directions to guide particles to adequately search for feature subsets with different sizes. Based on the two different search directions, BDFF can fix the selection states of some features and then focus on the others when updating particles, thus narrowing the large search space. Besides, a self-adaptive strategy is designed to help the swarm concentrate on a more promising direction for search in different stages of evolution and achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on 12 widely-used public datasets show that BDFF can improve the performance of PSO on large-scale feature selection and obtain smaller feature subsets with higher classification accuracy.",IEEE Transactions on Big Data,journal,['JournalArticle'],9cc701cf-1f49-4121-8ea9-11bac24d61ad,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,1004-1017,9,N/A,2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,22,60,"Jia-Quan Yang, Qi-Te Yang, Ke-Jing Du, Chun-Hua Chen, Hua Wang, Sang-Woon Jeon, Jinchao Zhang, Zhi-hui Zhan","2167905528, 2187161662, 2196699, 2168924226, 2197900893, 1699638, 27672597, 1680620",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b94342c6c5a493f8bad55c030ab1319c05b597a6,Computer Science,2167905528

Energy use depends upon various factors, such as climate, household characteristics, and behavior. Of these, income, education, and size of the family are very vital socio-economic factors that depict energy consumption levels and their pattern. The utmost objective of this research project was to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to analyze household energy consumption trends in the USA, integrating socioeconomic factors such as income, family size, and education. The dataset retrieved from Kaggle integrates detailed weather patterns with energy consumption data, putting into perspective the interaction between climatic variables and household energy use. It included key features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, along with time-series data on energy consumption metrics like electricity and natural gas usage at the household level. It provided information on several geographic zones across extended periods, so seasonality and regional variations may be studied. It was complemented with metadata that included timestamps, energy pricing, and household attributes and should therefore be a rich resource for predictive modeling and extracting relationships between weather conditions and energy demand. For this research project, three models were selected: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, each possessing particular strengths for the nature of the problem. This study employed key performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy. The Random Forest model had the highest value for accuracy, similarly, the highest AUC was for the Random Forest with the best AUC. As such, it was concluded that the Random Forest model provided the best trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate and can be relied upon for this classification task. The machine learning models generate valuable predictions about household energy use. Particularly, Random Forest models, which are trained on socioeconomic and weather data to predict the likelihood of a given household having high energy usage. The predictions by such models can be used to help energy providers determine when to invoke tiered pricing or encourage energy-saving behavior.",The American Journal of Engineering and Technology,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,The American Journal of Engineering and Technology,,,Unknown,2024,2024-12-19 00:00:00,9,0,"Muhammad Shoyaibur Rahman Chowdhury, Mohammad Saiful Islam, Md Abdullah Al Montaser, M.

We intended to investigate nonlinear relationships typical of the atmospheric variables using state-of-the-art ML methods for more accurate rainfall predictions. For this research project on rainfall forecasting in the USA, we utilized an extensive dataset that comprises historical rainfall data collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other meteorological agencies. The main dataset we use in this paper consists of daily rainfall measurements across various geographical locations of the USA, thus capturing the wide-ranging historical data necessary for both training and validation of the model. Besides measuring rainfall, we included meteorological data from sources such as NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications. These datasets further provided key variables that are known to affect rain, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The performance metrics used in this research work for the models considered include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The above table shows that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other models, achieving perfect accuracy. That indicated that it rightly classified all the instances in the test set. The Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models gave a quite good performance by giving above average accuracy but had lower precision and recall for the rainfall prediction. Accurate rainfall forecasting has direct consequences on agriculture, greatly empowering farmers and agricultural planners to make more effective decisions regarding planting, harvesting, and crop management. The forecasts of rainfall are also of critical importance in disaster management regarding planning for flood emergencies. Moreover, precise forecasting of rainfall, particularly in sustainable water resources management, presents the most important data in planning for and conserving these resources.",Journal of Environmental and Agricultural Studies,journal,['JournalArticle'],b843beae-7645-4217-9445-0f380ec83b64,Journal of Environmental and Agricultural Studies,,,N/A,2024,2024-11-09 00:00:00,7,0,"Abdullah Al Mukaddim, MD Rashed Mohaimin, Mohammad Abir Hider, Mitu Karmakar, Md Nasiruddin, Shah Alam, Farhana Rahman Anonna","2324999202, 2330095522, 2324991673, 2327913220, 2300776156, 2330092919, 2330094449",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfca42eafdd857b52a16778a31b49e35e1b7e353,"Computer Science, Environmental Science",2324999202

The disproportionate spatial accumulation of a drug in the interstitium is determined by several microenvironmental properties (blood vessel distribution and permeability, gradients in the interstitial fluid pressure). Predictions of tumour perfusion are key determinants of drug delivery and responsiveness to therapy. Pharmacokinetic models allow for the quantification of tracer perfusion based on contrast enhancement measured with non-invasive imaging techniques. An advanced cross-voxel exchange model (CVXM) was recently developed to provide a comprehensive description of tracer extravasation as well as advection and diffusion based on cross-voxel tracer kinetics (Sinno et al 2021). Transport parameters were derived from DCE-MRI of twenty TS-415 human cervical carcinoma xenografts by using CVXM. Tracer velocity flows were measured at the tumour periphery (mean 1.78–5.82 μm.s−1) pushing the contrast outward towards normal tissue. These elevated velocity measures and extravasation rates explain the heterogeneous distribution of tracer across the tumour and its accumulation at the periphery. Significant values for diffusivity were deduced across the tumours (mean 152–499 μm2.s−1). CVXM resulted in generally smaller values for the extravasation parameter Kext (mean 0.01–0.04 min−1) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction ve (mean 0.05–0.17) compared to the standard Tofts parameters, suggesting that Toft model underestimates the effects of inter-voxel exchange. The ratio of Tofts’ extravasation parameters over CVXM’s was significantly positively correlated to the cross-voxel diffusivity (P < 0.0001) and velocity (P = 0.0005). Tofts’ increased ve measurements were explained using Sinno et al (2021)’s theoretical work. Finally, a scan time of 15 min renders informative estimations of the transport parameters. However, a duration as low as 7.5 min is acceptable to recognize the spatial variation of transport parameters. The results demonstrate the potential of utilizing CVXM for determining metrics characterizing the exchange of tracer between the vasculature and the tumour tissue. Like for many earlier models, additional work is strongly recommended, in terms of validation, to develop more confidence in the results, motivating future laboratory work in this regard.",Physics in Medicine and Biology,journal,['JournalArticle'],d5594aad-095f-4587-802a-b011732c7100,Physics in Medicine & Biology,,67,N/A,2022,2022-11-22 00:00:00,2,56,"N.

Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects; while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body’s immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data; predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.",Vaccines,,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",057c6386-3be2-4649-8e9d-95d09e29102a,Vaccines,,9,Unknown,2021,2021-05-26 00:00:00,173,56,"Ma’mon M.

In this paper, in order to further constrain the mapping problem and reinforce the cycle consistency between two domains, we also introduce a novel regularization method based on the alignment of feature maps probability distributions. This type of optimization constraint, expressed via an additional loss function, allows for further reducing the size of the regions that are mapped from the source domain into the same image in the target domain, which leads to mapping closer to the bijective and thus better performance. By selecting feature maps of the network layers with the same depth d in the encoder of the direct generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the decoder of the inverse GAN, it is possible to describe their d-dimensional probability distributions and, through novel regularization term, enforce similarity between representations of the same image in both domains during the mapping cycle. We introduce several ground distances between Gaussian distributions of the corresponding feature maps used in the regularization. In the experiments conducted on several real datasets, we achieved better performance in the unsupervised image transfer task in comparison to the baseline CycleGAN, and obtained results that were much closer to the fully supervised pix2pix method for all used datasets. The PSNR measure of the proposed method was, on average, 4.7% closer to the results of the pix2pix method in comparison to the baseline CycleGAN over all datasets. This also held for SSIM, where the described percentage was 8.3% on average over all datasets.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-01-10 00:00:00,4,0,"Lidija Krstanović, Branislav M.

Nevertheless, in many real-world applications one of the domains is reduced, i.e., scarce. This means that it has much less training data available in comparison to the other domain, which is fully observable. In order to tackle the problem of using CycleGAN framework in such unfavorable application scenarios, we propose and invoke a novel Bootstrapped SSL CycleGAN architecture (BTS-SSL), where the mentioned problem is overcome using two strategies. Firstly, by using a relatively small percentage of available labelled training data from the reduced or scarce domain and a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach, we prevent overfitting of the discriminator belonging to the reduced domain, which would otherwise occur during initial training iterations due to the small amount of available training data in the scarce domain. Secondly, after initial learning guided by the described SSL strategy, additional bootstrapping (BTS) of the reduced data domain is performed by inserting artifically generated training examples into the training poll of the data discriminator belonging to the scarce domain. Bootstrapped samples are generated by the already trained neural network that performs transferring from the fully observable to the scarce domain. The described procedure is periodically repeated during the training process several times and results in significantly improved performance of the final model in comparison to the original unsupervised CycleGAN approach. The same also holds in comparison to the solutions that are exclusively based either on the described SSL, or on the bootstrapping strategy, i.e., when these are applied separately. Moreover, in the considered scarce scenarios it also shows competitive results in comparison to the fully supervised solution based on the pix2pix method. In that sense, it is directly applicable to many domain transfer tasks that are relying on the CycleGAN architecture.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2022,2022-03-27 00:00:00,3,5,"Lidija Krstanović, Branislav M.

Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3D printing community.",J.

Plant diseases and pests are considered one of the most imperative factors influencing food production, quality, and minimize losses in production. Farmers are currently facing difficulty in identifying various plant diseases and pests, which are important to prevent plant diseases effectively in a complicated environment. The recent development of deep learning techniques has found use in the diagnosis of plant diseases and pests, providing a robust tool with highly accurate results. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature that aims to identify the state of the art of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the process of diagnosing and identification of plant pest and diseases. In addition, it presents some issues that are facing the models performance, and also indicates gaps that should be addressed in the future. In this regard, we review studies with various methods that addressed plant disease detection, dataset characteristics, the crops, and pathogens. Moreover, it discusses the commonly employed five-step methodology for plant disease recognition, involving data acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. It discusses various deep learning architecture-based solutions that have a faster convergence rate of plant disease recognition. From this review, it is possible to understand the innovative trends regarding the use of CNN’s algorithms in the plant diseases diagnosis and to recognize the gaps that need the attention of the research community.",ARO.

The SDN enables the network operators to manage the overall network consistently and holistically, regardless the complexity of infrastructure devices. The promising features of the SDN enhance network security and facilitate the implementation of threat detection systems through software applications using open APIs. However, the emerging technology creates new security concerns and new threats that do not exist in the current traditional networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) are one of the most rampant attacks that can interrupt the functionality of the network and make most of the network services unreachable for network users. The efficient identification of DDos attacks on SDN environments in literature is still a challenge because of the number of network features taken into account and the overhead of applying machine learning based anomaly detection techniques. Hence, in this paper, we aim to use two popular feature selection methods, i.e., Information Gain (IG) and Random Forest (RF) in order to analyse the most comprehensive relevant features of DDoS attacks in SDN networks. Using the most relevant features will improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection system and reduce the false alarm rates. Moreover, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) technique based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoencoder to tackle the problem of DDoS attacks in SDNs. We perform our analysis and evaluation on three different datasets, i.e., InSDN, CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018. We also measure the overhead of the proposed DL model on the SDN controller and test the network performance in terms of network throughput and end-to-end latency. The results validate that the DL approach can efficiently identify DDoS attacks in SDN environments without any significant degradation in the controller performance.",IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,journal,['JournalArticle'],65e58b80-9699-4da6-bd60-929b57b8533d,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,1862-1880,8,N/A,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,82,71,"Mahmoud Said El Sayed, Nhien-An Le-Khac, Marianne A.

Web servers that run on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) are exposed to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A sophisticated version of this attack known as distributed denial of service (DDOS) is among the most dangerous Internet attacks, with the ability to overwhelm a web server, thereby slowing it down and potentially taking it down completely. This paper reviewed 12 recent detection of DDoS attack at the application layer published between January 2014 and December 2018. A summary of each detection method is summarised in table view, along with in-depth critical analysis, for future studies to conduct research pertaining to detection of HTTP DDoS attack.",J. Comput.

The IoT layer contains various intelligent IoT devices that generate a large number of tasks, each characterized by distinct specifications such as size, computational demand, communication requirements, and latency constraints. owing to the limited storage and computing capacity of resource-constrained IoT devices, it is essential to offload these tasks to different layers to ensure effective processing while satisfying the required Quality of Service (QoS) goals. To address this challenge, a fuzzy logic-based task scheduler is employed to make informed offloading decisions, considering task attributes and determining the most suitable processing layers—whether locally at the IoT layer, on collaborative fog nodes, or in the cloud. Furthermore, the study leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) method, a form of deep reinforcement learning, to identify the optimal fog node for offloading tasks and to maintain a balanced workload distribution across collaborative fog nodes. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of latency, power consumption, network usage, throughput, and offloading rate in comparison with the Non-offload, First-Fit, GASDEO, and NAFITO-FLA methods.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,39936-39952,12,N/A,2024,,14,40,"Dezheen H.

Addressing a single dataset alone to build a machine learning model for the identification of heart problems is not practical because each country and hospital has its own data schema, structure, and quality. On this basis, a generic framework has been built for heart problem diagnosis. This framework is a hybrid framework that employs multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques and votes for the best outcome based on a novel voting technique with the intention to remove bias from the model. The framework contains two consequent layers. The first layer contains simultaneous machine learning models running over a given dataset. The second layer consolidates the outputs of the first layer and classifies them as a second classification layer based on novel voting techniques. Prior to the classification process, the framework selects the top features using a proposed feature selection framework. It starts by filtering the columns using multiple feature selection methods and considers the top common features selected. Results from the proposed framework, with 95.6% accuracy, show its superiority over the single machine learning model, classical stacking technique, and traditional voting technique. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate how the prediction probabilities of multiple models can be exploited for the purpose of creating another layer for final output; this step neutralizes any model bias. Another experimental contribution is proving the complete pipeline’s ability to be retrained and used for other datasets collected using different measurements and with different distributions.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,396,2023,2023-01-26 00:00:00,15,49,"A.

In this work, the effects of prickly ash on key taste compounds in stewed sheep tail fat soup were investigated. Results showed that the taste intensity of sheep tail fat soup cooked with 0.2% prickly ash increased significantly. The concentration of organic acids and free amino acids in sheep tail fat soup significantly increased with the addition of prickly ash. The concentration of succinic acid (2.637 to 4.580 mg/g) and Thr (2.558 to 12.466 mg/g) increased the most among organic acids and amino acids, respectively. Spearman’s correlation analysis elucidated that seven taste compounds were positively correlated (correlation coefficient > 0.7) with the overall taste intensity of the soup sample including Thr, Asp, oxalic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, and ascorbic acid. Additional experiments and quantitative descriptive analysis further confirmed that Asp, lactic acid and citric acid were the key taste compounds to improve saltiness and umami taste in sheep tail fat soup with prickly ash.",Foods,journal,['JournalArticle'],e9a44b89-3d84-4bff-8c78-c53cd2ad7cf8,Foods,,11,N/A,2022,2022-03-22 00:00:00,11,42,"Yan Huang, Dandan Pu, Zhilin Hao, Li Liang, Jing Zhao, Yizhuang Tang, Yuyu Zhang","2155605291, 30451093, 2147215420, 2087343708, 2151692457, 1560603063, 2108306996",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40fe4fbb9f6bbbf733cc3bd3bf7b0dd06d2e6731,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Medicine",2155605291

We tackle the challenge of finding a closed-loop control policy to optimally schedule the operation of a storage device, in order to maximize self-consumption of local photovoltaic production in a microgrid. In this work, the fitted Q-iteration algorithm, a standard batch RL technique, is used by an RL agent to construct a control policy. The proposed method is data-driven and uses a state-action value function to find an optimal scheduling plan for a battery. The battery’s charge and discharge efficiencies, and the nonlinearity in the microgrid due to the inverter’s efficiency are taken into account. The proposed approach has been tested by simulation in a residential setting using data from Belgian residential consumers. The developed framework is benchmarked with a model-based technique, and the simulation results show a performance gap of 19%. The simulation results provide insight for developing optimal policies in more realistically-scaled and interconnected microgrids and for including uncertainties in generation and consumption for which white-box models become inaccurate and/or infeasible.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Energies,1846,10,Unknown,2017,2017-11-12 00:00:00,141,36,"Brida V.

This paper presents a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) self-tuning temperature sensing and control system for efficiently modulating the temperature environment within a multi-module instrument. The smart system ensures that the internal temperature of the instrument converges to a target without the need of a system model, thus making the control robust. The system consists of a fully-connected proportional–integral–derivative (PID) neural network (FCPIDNN) and an on-line self-tuning module. The experimental results show that the presented system can effectively control the internal temperature under various mission scenarios, in particular, it is able to self-reconfigure upon actuator failure. The system provides a new scheme for a complex and time-variant MIMO control system which can be widely applied for the distributed measurement and control of the environment in instruments, integration electronics, and house constructions.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,16,396,2016,2016-10-01 00:00:00,6,20,"Zhen Zhang, Cheng Ma, Rong Zhu","2118029605, 144970602, 2070270377",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9ecf47e17a8d890884c94eae4995db47a83cf06,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2118029605

It advances dynamic resource allocation and power management. This study employs deep neural networks including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) techniques to one-hour-ahead forecast the volume of expected traffic and compares this approach to other methods including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). The deep neural network implementation in this study analyses, evaluates and generates predictions based on the data of telecommunications activity every one hour, continuously in one year, released by Viettel Telecom in Vietnam. The performance indexes, including RMSE, MAPE, MAE, R and Theil’s U are used to make comparison of the developed models. The obtained results show that both LSTM and GRU model outperformed the ANFIS, ANN and GMDH models. The research findings are expected to provide an assistance and forecasting tool for telecom network operators. The experimental results also indicate that the proposed model is efficient and suitable for real-world network traffic prediction.",Journal of Computer Science,journal,,449b5e8b-cda2-4a8e-b27b-9b7917ded9eb,Journal of Computer Science,,,N/A,2020,2020-09-01 00:00:00,18,19,"Quang Hung Do, Thi Thanh Hang Doan, T.

This result indicates the possibility that BERT networks capture structural information about language. In this work, we provide novel support for this claim by performing a series of experiments to unpack the elements of English language structure learned by BERT. Our findings are fourfold. BERT’s phrasal representation captures the phrase-level information in the lower layers. The intermediate layers of BERT compose a rich hierarchy of linguistic information, starting with surface features at the bottom, syntactic features in the middle followed by semantic features at the top. BERT requires deeper layers while tracking subject-verb agreement to handle long-term dependency problem. Finally, the compositional scheme underlying BERT mimics classical, tree-like structures.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,,3651-3657,,396,2019,2019-07-28 00:00:00,1220,24,"Ganesh Jawahar, Benoît Sagot, Djamé Seddah","145123979, 68990982, 1679170",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/335613303ebc5eac98de757ed02a56377d99e03a,"Computer Science, Linguistics",145123979

For retailers and marketing analysts, such methods can support the understanding of customers' attitudes towards brands, especially to handle crises that cause behavioural changes in customers, including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the increasing adoption of black-box machine learning-based techniques, transparency becomes a need for those stakeholders to understand why a given sentiment is predicted, which is rarely explored for retailers facing social media crises. This study develops an Explainable Sentiment Analysis (XSA) application for Twitter data, and proposes research propositions focused on evaluating such application in a hypothetical crisis management scenario. Particularly, we evaluate, through discussions and a simulated user experiment, the XSA support for understanding customer's needs, as well as if marketing analysts would trust such an application for their decision-making processes. Results illustrate the XSA application can be effective in providing the most important words addressing customers sentiment out of individual tweets, as well as the potential to foster analysts' confidence in such support.

This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the development of theoretical models in the area of social media crisis communication and management. The study aims to review and analyse the relationship of social media-based crisis communication in the context of crisis informatics and its taxonomy and the related crisis communication theoretical models to derive the challenges and limitations. A total of 207 articles were selected for the evaluation based on quality, relevancy, and contribution. The findings revealed that the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) is the most dominant theory, followed by social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) and integrated crisis mapping (ICM) models. The study identified theories such as the STREMII model, social media crisis management matrix/framework (SMSMF), and an interactive crisis communication model (ICCM) as emerging models. Moreover, the result of the finding shows that stakeholder interaction is an understudied field, while information reliability and processing for decision-making purposes, the wider application of social media sites, privacy issues, and how social media interaction can improve community resilience or build stakeholders relationships remain suitable topics for future research.",IEEE Access,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,185842-185869,8,N/A,2020,2020-10-12 00:00:00,37,180,"U.

In parallel, a method to optimize the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of PET detectors by use of the DOI information is proposed and tested. For these purposes, a dedicated 64-channels readout setup has been developed with intrinsic timing resolution of 16 ps FWHM. Several PET modules have been produced, based on LYSO:Ce scintillators and commercial silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays, with mm2 individual SiPM size. The results show the possibility to achieve a timing resolution of 157 ps FWHM, combined with the already demonstrated spatial resolution of 1.5 mm FWHM, DOI resolution of 3 mm FWHM, and energy resolution of 9% FWHM at 511 keV, with 15 mm long crystals of section mm2 and mm2.

GTB models have been shown to be implementable in FPGA if the memory requirement fits the available resources. We propose two optimization scenarios for the best possible positioning performance: One restricting the available memory to enable a future FPGA implementation and one without any restrictions. The positioning performance of the GTB models is compared with a DOI estimation method based on a single DOI observable (SO) comparable to other methods presented in literature. For a 12 mm high monolith, we achieve an averaged spatial resolution of 2.15 mm and 2.12 mm FWHM for SO and GTB models, respectively.

6236a56c9ffaa3f96c17b90e3f93cf1604db8aec,10.1002/mp.12906,"An edge‐readout, multilayer detector for positron emission tomography","Purpose We present a novel gamma‐ray‐detector design based on total internal reflection (TIR) of scintillation photons within a crystal that addresses many limitations of traditional PET detectors. Our approach has appealing features, including submillimeter lateral resolution, DOI positioning from layer thickness, and excellent energy resolution. The design places light sensors on the edges of a stack of scintillator slabs separated by small air gaps and exploits the phenomenon that more than 80% of scintillation light emitted during a gamma‐ray event reaches the edges of a thin crystal with polished faces due to TIR. Gamma‐ray stopping power is achieved by stacking multiple layers, and DOI is determined by which layer the gamma ray interacts in. Method The concept of edge readouts of a thin slab was verified by Monte Carlo simulation of scintillation light transport. An LYSO crystal of dimensions 50.8 mm × 50.8 mm × 3.0 mm was modeled with five rectangular SiPMs placed along each edge face. The mean‐detector‐response functions (MDRFs) were calculated by simulating signals from 511 keV gamma‐ray interactions in a grid of locations. Simulations were carried out to study the influence of choice of scintillator material and dimensions, gamma‐ray photon energies, introduction of laser or mechanically induced optical barriers (LIOBs, MIOBs), and refractive indices of optical‐coupling media and SiPM windows. We also analyzed timing performance including influence of gamma‐ray interaction position and presence of optical barriers. We also modeled and built a prototype detector, a 27.4 mm × 27.4 mm × 3.0 mm CsI(Tl) crystal with 4 SiPMs per edge to experimentally validate the results predicted by the simulations. The prototype detector used CsI(Tl) crystals from Proteus outfitted with 16 Hamamatsu model S13360‐6050PE MPPCs read out by an AiT‐16‐channel readout. The MDRFs were measured by scanning the detector with a collimated beam of 662‐keV photons from a 137Cs source. The spatial resolution was experimentally determined by imaging a tungsten slit that created a beam of 0.44 mm (FWHM) width normal to the detector surface. The energy resolution was evaluated by analyzing list‐mode data from flood illumination by the 137Cs source. Result We find that in a block‐detector‐sized LYSO layer read out by five SiPMs per edge, illuminated by 511‐keV photons, the average resolution is 1.49 mm (FWHM). With the introduction of optical barriers, average spatial resolution improves to 0.56 mm (FWHM). The DOI resolution is the layer thickness of 3.0 mm. We also find that optical‐coupling media and SiPM‐window materials have an impact on spatial resolution. The timing simulation with LYSO crystal yields a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of 200–400 ps, which is slightly position dependent. And the introduction of optical barriers has minimum influence. The prototype CsI(Tl) detector, with a smaller area and fewer SiPMs, was measured to have central‐area spatial resolutions of 0.70 and 0.39 mm without and with optical barriers, respectively. These results match well with our simulations. An energy resolution of 6.4% was achieved at 662 keV. Conclusion A detector design based on a stack of monolithic scintillator layers that uses edge readouts offers several advantages over current block detectors for PET. For example, there is no tradeoff between spatial resolution and detection sensitivity since no reflector material displaces scintillator crystal, and submillimeter resolution can be achieved.

The trained models succeed in differentiating major secondary sources and quantitatively estimating the contributions of both primary and secondary sources at least during the last glacial‐interglacial cycle.

 The geochemistry of Cenozoic intracontinental high-Mg andesites (HMAs) in northeast Asia, together with regional geophysical data, offers an opportunity to explore the genetic relationship between the formation of intracontinental HMAs and subduction of the Pacific plate. Compared with primary HMAs in arcs, Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia have lower Mg# [100 × Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)] values (53–56) and CaO contents (5.8–6.6 wt%), higher alkali (Na2O + K2O) contents (5.15–6.45 wt%), and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7056–0.7059; εNd = −4.9 to −3.4; εHf = −4.7 to −2.6) as well as lower Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb = 16.76–19.19; 207Pb/204Pb = 15.42–15.45; 208Pb/204Pb = 36.71–37.11). These Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs are similar to Cenozoic potassic basalts in northeast China with respect to their Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions but have higher SiO2 and Al2O3 contents and lower K2O, MgO, and light rare earth element contents. These features indicate that these Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs originated from the mantle, where recycled ancient sediments and water contributed to partial melting of peridotite. Combined with the presence of a large low-resistivity anomaly derived from the mantle transition zone (MTZ) near these intracontinental HMAs, and their occurrence above the stagnant slab front within the MTZ (at 600 km depth) in northeast Asia, we conclude that the stagnant slab front, with high contents of recycled ancient sediments and water, has controlled the formation of Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia.",Geology,journal,,c152ea18-c087-4170-bce5-8c752e71e7c8,Geology,,,N/A,2020,2020-08-07 00:00:00,28,43,"Wenliang Xu, Jia-hui Chen, A.

A rigorous approach to observational studies involves collecting data from different sensors to comprehensively capture the situation of the subject. However, this leads to technical difficulties especially if the sensors are from different manufacturers, as multiple data collection tools have to run simultaneously. We present SensorHub, a system that can collect data from various wearable devices from different manufacturers, such as inertial measurement units, portable electrocardiographs, portable electroencephalographs, portable photoplethysmographs, and sensors for electrodermal activity. Additionally, our tool offers the possibility to include ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in studies. Hence, SensorHub enables multimodal sensor data collection under real-world conditions and allows direct user feedback to be collected through questionnaires, enabling studies at home. In a first study with 11 participants, we successfully used SensorHub to record multiple signals with different devices and collected additional information with the help of EMAs. In addition, we evaluated SensorHub’s technical capabilities in several trials with up to 21 participants recording simultaneously using multiple sensors with sampling frequencies as high as 1000 Hz. We could show that although there is a theoretical limitation to the transmissible data rate, in practice this limitation is not an issue and data loss is rare. We conclude that with modern communication protocols and with the increasingly powerful smartphones and wearables, a system like our SensorHub establishes an interoperability framework to adequately combine consumer-grade sensing hardware which enables observational studies in real life.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,396,2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,9,25,"Jonas Chromik, Kristina Kirsten, Arne Herdick, A.

In particular, physiological signals are widely used to detect and classify affective states in lab conditions. However, physiological reactions to emotional stimuli have been found to differ in laboratory and natural settings. Thanks to recent technological progress (e.g., in wearables) the creation of EMSR systems for a large number of consumers during their everyday activities is increasingly possible. Therefore, datasets created in the wild are needed to insure the validity and the exploitability of EMSR models for real-life applications. In this paper, we initially present common techniques used in laboratory settings to induce emotions for the purpose of physiological dataset creation. Next, advantages and challenges of data collection in the wild are discussed. To assess the applicability of existing datasets to real-life applications, we propose a set of categories to guide and compare at a glance different methodologies used by researchers to collect such data. For this purpose, we also introduce a visual tool called Graphical Assessment of Real-life Application-Focused Emotional Dataset (GARAFED). In the last part of the paper, we apply the proposed tool to compare existing physiological datasets for EMSR in the wild and to show possible improvements and future directions of research.

However, GPS does not work indoors due to a lack of direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) satellite signals received from the End Device (ED) due to thick solid materials blocking the ultra-high frequency signals. Furthermore, fingerprint localization using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values is typical for localization in indoor environments. Therefore, this paper develops a low-power intelligent localization system for indoor environments using Long-Range Wide-Area Networks (LoRaWAN) RSSI values with Random Neural Networks (RNN). The proposed localization system demonstrates 98.5% improvement in average localization error compared to related studies with a minimum average localization error of 0.12 m in the Line-of-Sight (LOS). The obtained results confirm LoRaWAN-RNN-based localization systems suitable for indoor environments in LOS applied in big sports halls, hospital wards, shopping malls, airports, and many more with the highest accuracy of 99.52%. Furthermore, a minimum average localization error of 13.94 m was obtained in the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenario, and this result is appropriate for the management and control of vehicles in indoor car parks, industries, or any other fleet in a pre-defined area in the NLOS with the highest accuracy of 44.24%.",Inf.,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Inf.,303,13,Unknown,2022,2022-06-16 00:00:00,14,23,"Winfred Ingabire, H.

In this paper, we present printed sensor antennas for the [862–928] MHz band supporting LoRa and Sigfox and the [2.4–2.5] GHz band for WiFi, Bluetooth, and IEEE802.15.4 communication. To integrate them into smart suitcases, the antennas are printed, overmolded, tested, and measured, following a dedicated conformal integration strategy consisting of two design iterations. Additionally, as a more convenient connection to the printed antennas, printed transmission lines along with a dedicated transition to printed circuit board technologies are implemented and characterized, avoiding rigid coaxial connectors that exhibit fragile mounting on flexible substrates. The overmolded stand-alone antennas achieve fractional impedance bandwidths of 26% and 15% covering the [862–928] MHz and [2.4–2.5] GHz bands, respectively, with a substantial margin and with in-band simulated total efficiencies of 94% and 88%, respectively.

Our method combines a unique problem representation and an unbiased optimization protocol to learn from mirBase19.0 an accurate predictive model, termed MiRduplexSVM. This is the first model that provides precise information about all four ends of the miRNA duplex. We show that (a) our method outperforms four state-of-the-art tools, namely MaturePred, MiRPara, MatureBayes, MiRdup as well as a Simple Geometric Locator when applied on the same training datasets employed for each tool and evaluated on a common blind test set. (b) In all comparisons, MiRduplexSVM shows superior performance, achieving up to a 60% increase in prediction accuracy for mammalian hairpins and can generalize very well on plant hairpins, without any special optimization. (c) The tool has a number of important applications such as the ability to accurately predict the miRNA or the miRNA*, given the opposite strand of a duplex. Its performance on this task is superior to the 2nts overhang rule commonly used in computational studies and similar to that of a comparative genomic approach, without the need for prior knowledge or the complexity of performing multiple alignments. Finally, it is able to evaluate novel, potential miRNAs found either computationally or experimentally. In relation with recent confidence evaluation methods used in miRBase, MiRduplexSVM was successful in identifying high confidence potential miRNAs.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,10,N/A,2015,2015-05-11 00:00:00,22,32,"Nestoras Karathanasis, I.

Most computational tools labeled as miRNA predictors are in fact pre-miRNA predictors and provide no information about the putative miRNA location within the pre-miRNA. Sequence and structural features that determine the location of the miRNA, and the extent to which these properties vary from species to species, are poorly understood. We have developed miRdup, a computational predictor for the identification of the most likely miRNA location within a given pre-miRNA or the validation of a candidate miRNA. MiRdup is based on a random forest classifier trained with experimentally validated miRNAs from miRbase, with features that characterize the miRNA–miRNA* duplex. Because we observed that miRNAs have sequence and structural properties that differ between species, mostly in terms of duplex stability, we trained various clade-specific miRdup models and obtained increased accuracy. MiRdup self-trains on the most recent version of miRbase and is easy to use. Combined with existing pre-miRNA predictors, it will be valuable for both de novo mapping of miRNAs and filtering of large sets of candidate miRNAs obtained from transcriptome sequencing projects.

Less is known about the presence of messenger RNA (mRNA). This report profiles the human circulating mRNA transcriptome in people with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to determine whether mRNA analytes can be used as biomarkers of liver disease. Using RNAseq and RT-qPCR, we investigate circulating mRNA in plasma from HCC and LC patients and demonstrate detection of transcripts representing more than 19,000 different protein coding genes. Remarkably, the circulating mRNA expression levels were similar from person to person over the 21 individuals whose samples were analyzed by RNAseq. Liver derived circulating transcripts such as albumin (ALB), apolipoprotein (APO) A1, A2 & H, serpin A1 & E1, ferritin light chain (FTL) and fibrinogen like 1 (FGL1) were significantly upregulated in HCC patient samples. Higher levels of some of these liver-specific transcripts in the plasma of HCC patients were confirmed by RT-qPCR in another cohort of 20 individuals. Several less abundant circulating transcripts associated with cancer were detected in most HCC samples, but not in healthy subjects. Liver specificity of circulating transcripts was confirmed by investigating their expression in HCC tumor and liver cancer cell lines. Liver specific mRNA sequences in the plasma were predominantly present outside circulating extracellular vesicles. Conclusions: The circulating “mRNA” transcriptome is remarkably consistent in diversity and expression from person to person. Detection of transcripts corresponding to disease selective polypeptides suggests the possibility that circulating mRNA can work as a biomarker analyte for cancer detection.",OncoTarget,journal,['JournalArticle'],106ecc86-1801-4b36-a05c-d36db69a968c,Oncotarget,2216 - 2232,11,N/A,2020,2020-06-09 00:00:00,15,53,"A.

Many targets of PARP-1/2-dependent PARylation are involved in the DNA damage response and hence, the loss of these proteins disrupts a wide range of biological processes, from DNA repair and epigenetics to telomere and centromere regulation. The central role of these PARPs in DNA metabolism in cancer cells has led to the development of PARP inhibitors as new cancer therapeutics, both as adjuvant treatment potentiating chemo-, radio-, and immuno-therapies and as monotherapy exploiting cancer-specific defects in DNA repair. However, a cancer is not just made up of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment also includes multiple other cell types, particularly stromal and immune cells. Interactions between these cells—cancerous and non-cancerous—are known to either favor or limit tumorigenesis. In recent years, an important role of PARP-1 and PARP-2 has been demonstrated in different aspects of the immune response, modulating both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is now emerging that PARP-1 and PARP-2 may not only impact cancer cell biology, but also modulate the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the immunomodulatory roles of PARP-1 and PARP-2 may provide invaluable clues to the rational development of more selective PARP-centered therapies which target both the cancer and its microenvironment.",Cancers,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,12,N/A,2020,2020-02-01 00:00:00,56,104,"J.

Centralized Training Data","Federated learning (also known as collaborative learning) is a machine learning technique that trains
an algorithm without transferring data samples across numerous decentralized edge devices or
servers. This strategy differs from standard centralized machine learning techniques in which all local
datasets are uploaded to a single server, as well as more traditional decentralized alternatives, which
frequently presume that local data samples are uniformly distributed.
Federated learning allows several actors to collaborate on the development of a single, robust
machine learning model without sharing data, allowing crucial issues such as data privacy, data
security, data access rights, and access to heterogeneous data to be addressed. Defence,
telecommunications, internet of things, and pharmaceutical industries are just a few of the sectors

The use of non-verbal cues such as gestures, body movement, and facial expressions convey the feeling and the feedback to the user. This discipline of Human–Computer Interaction places reliance on the algorithmic robustness and the sensitivity of the sensor to ameliorate the recognition. Sensors play a significant role in accurate detection by providing a very high-quality input, hence increasing the efficiency and the reliability of the system. Automatic recognition of human emotions would help in teaching social intelligence in the machines. This paper presents a brief study of the various approaches and the techniques of emotion recognition. The survey covers a succinct review of the databases that are considered as data sets for algorithms detecting the emotions by facial expressions. Later, mixed reality device Microsoft HoloLens (MHL) is introduced for observing emotion recognition in Augmented Reality (AR). A brief introduction of its sensors, their application in emotion recognition and some preliminary results of emotion recognition using MHL are presented. The paper then concludes by comparing results of emotion recognition by the MHL and a regular webcam.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,396,2018,2018-02-01 00:00:00,134,73,"Dhwani Mehta, M.

Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG “combo” pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting “clean” PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment. The proposed system has been validated and the results confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,396,2018,2018-01-30 00:00:00,125,42,"F.

It plays an important role in many natural language processing applications such as text summarization, question answering, machine translation, information retrieval, dialog systems, plagiarism detection, and query ranking. STS has been widely studied in the general English domain. However, there exists few resources for STS tasks in the clinical domain and in languages other than English, such as Japanese. Objective The objective of this study is to capture semantic similarity between Japanese clinical texts (Japanese clinical STS) by creating a Japanese dataset that is publicly available. Materials We created two datasets for Japanese clinical STS: (1) Japanese case reports (CR dataset) and (2) Japanese electronic medical records (EMR dataset). The CR dataset was created from publicly available case reports extracted from the CiNii database. The EMR dataset was created from Japanese electronic medical records. Methods We used an approach based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to capture the semantic similarity between the clinical domain texts. BERT is a popular approach for transfer learning and has been proven to be effective in achieving high accuracy for small datasets. We implemented two Japanese pretrained BERT models: a general Japanese BERT and a clinical Japanese BERT. The general Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese Wikipedia texts while the clinical Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese clinical texts. Results The BERT models performed well in capturing semantic similarity in our datasets. The general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT and achieved a high correlation with human score (0.904 in the CR dataset and 0.875 in the EMR dataset). It was unexpected that the general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT on clinical domain dataset. This could be due to the fact that the general Japanese BERT is pretrained on a wide range of texts compared with the clinical Japanese BERT.",Methods of Information in Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],95f5bdab-1f05-4090-899f-3869a15b5707,Methods of Information in Medicine,e56 - e64,60,N/A,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,24,28,"Faith W.

Although multilingual LMs were also introduced to serve many languages, these have limitations such as being costly at inference time and the size and diversity of non-English data involved in their pre-training. We remedy these issues for a collection of diverse Arabic varieties by introducing two powerful deep bidirectional transformer-based models, ARBERT and MARBERT. To evaluate our models, we also introduce ARLUE, a new benchmark for multi-dialectal Arabic language understanding evaluation. ARLUE is built using 42 datasets targeting six different task clusters, allowing us to offer a series of standardized experiments under rich conditions. When fine-tuned on ARLUE, our models collectively achieve new state-of-the-art results across the majority of tasks (37 out of 48 classification tasks, on the 42 datasets). Our best model acquires the highest ARLUE score (77.40) across all six task clusters, outperforming all other models including XLM-R Large ( 3.4x larger size).

We also calculated and obtained the dVMHC value between the cerebral cortexes. Results Compared with the normal control group, the dVMHC of the lingual gyrus (Ling) and the calcarine sulcus (CAL), which represented the visual network (VN), increased significantly in the asthma group, while the dVMHC of the medial superior frontal gyrus (MSFG), the anterior/middle/posterior cingulate gyrus (A/M/PCG), and the supplementary motor area (SMA) of the sensorimotor network decreased significantly in the asthma group. Conclusion This study showed that the ability of emotion regulation and the efficiency of visual and cognitive information processing in patients with BA was lower than in those in the HC group.

This is achieved by combining a quadrupole-based transverse phase-space tomography with the adjustable streaking angle of a polarizable X-band transverse deflection structure. We demonstrate with detailed simulations that the method is able to reconstruct various complex phase-space distributions and that the quality of the reconstruction depends on the number of input projections. This method allows for the identification and visualization of previously unnoticed detailed features in the phase-space distribution and can thereby be used as a tool toward improving the performance of particle accelerators or performing more accurate simulation studies.

Contributing to this problem are change in burn appearance throughout the first week requiring periodic evaluation until a confident diagnosis can be made. To overcome these issues, we investigated the feasibility of an artificial intelligence algorithm trained with multispectral images of burn injuries to predict burn depth rapidly and accurately, including burns of indeterminate depth. In a feasibility study, 406 multispectral images of burns were collected within 72 hours of injury and then serially for up to 7 days. Simultaneously, the subject’s clinician indicated whether the burn was of indeterminate depth. The final depth of burned regions within images were agreed upon by a panel of burn practitioners using biopsies and 21-day healing assessments as reference standards. We compared three convolutional neural network architectures and an ensemble in their capability to automatically highlight areas of nonhealing burn regions within images. The top algorithm was the ensemble with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 97% positive predictive value (PPV). Its sensitivity and PPV were found to increase in a sigmoid shape during the first week postburn, with the inflection point at day 2.5. Additionally, when burns were labeled as indeterminate, the algorithm’s sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value were: 70%, 100%, 97%, and 100%. These results suggest multispectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence is feasible for detecting nonhealing burn tissue and could play an important role in aiding the earlier diagnosis of indeterminate burns.",Journal of Burn Care & Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],ee38b919-df66-49ac-a082-bdbeaea54293,Journal of Burn Care & Research: Official Publication of the American Burn Association,969 - 981,44,N/A,2023,2023-04-21 00:00:00,5,48,"Jeffrey E.

However, severe skin burns are highly dynamic and hard to predict. This results in a low accuracy rate of about 60 - 75% in the diagnosis of partial-thickness burns in the acute post-burn period. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has demonstrated a significant potential for non-invasive and timely estimation of the burn severity. Here, we describe a methodology for the measurement and numerical modeling of the dielectric permittivity of the in vivo porcine skin burns. We use the double Debye dielectric relaxation theory to model the permittivity of the burned tissue. We further investigate the origins of dielectric contrast between the burns of various severity, as determined histologically based on the percentage of the burned dermis, using the empirical Debye parameters. We demonstrate that the five parameters of the double Debye model can form an artificial neural network classification algorithm capable of automatic diagnosis of the severity of the burn injuries, and predicting its ultimate wound healing outcome by forecasting its re-epithelialization status in 28 days. Our results demonstrate that the Debye dielectric parameters provide a physics-based approach for the extraction of the biomedical diagnostic markers from the broadband THz pulses. This method can significantly boost dimensionality reduction of THz training data in artificial intelligence models and streamline machine learning algorithms.",Biomedical Optics Express,journal,['JournalArticle'],7e331686-6620-4481-a3d5-5effffe9ab83,Biomedical optics express,"

Wearable biosensors have been widely applied in, among others, biometrics, sports, health care, rehabilitation assistance, and edutainment. Continuous data collection from biodevices provides a valuable volume of information, which needs to be curated and prepared before serving machine learning applications. One of the universal preparation steps is data segmentation and labelling/annotation. This work proposes a practical and manageable way to automatically segment and label single-channel or multimodal biosignal data using a self-similarity matrix (SSM) computed with signals’ feature-based representation. Applied to public biosignal datasets and a benchmark for change point detection, the proposed approach delivered lucid visual support in interpreting the biosignals with the SSM while performing accurate automatic segmentation of biosignals with the help of the novelty function and associating the segments grounded on their similarity measures with the similarity profiles. The proposed method performed superior to other algorithms in most cases of a series of automatic biosignal segmentation tasks; of equal appeal is that it provides an intuitive visualization for information retrieval of multimodal biosignals.",Biosensors,journal,['JournalArticle'],fe3b42b8-4af0-4a32-870f-e07da5a91be7,Biosensors,,12,N/A,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,33,97,"João Rodrigues, Hui Liu, Duarte Folgado, David Belo, Tanja Schultz, Hugo Gamboa","152794065, 2146672447, 50816880, 3333688, 2134361463, 2161060249",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c824d095fbf7d9afdde8c36909fc70eb569f15c3,"Biology, Computer Science, Medicine",152794065

A total of 250 Taiwanese adults (total group, TOG) aged 22-64 years participated in this study, and were stratified into a normal group (NOG: 135), an overweight group (OVG: 69), and an obesity group (OBG: 46), according to the BMI classification recommended by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare. VO2max was directly measured on an electromagnetic bicycle ergometer. Using the participant's heart rate in the 3-min incremental step-in-place test and demographic parameters, VO2max prediction models established for four groups were TOG model, NOG model, OVG model, and OBG model, respectively. Compared with the TOG model, the OVG and OBG models had higher coefficients of determination and lower standard error of estimates (SEEs), or %SEEs. The validities of the NOG (r = 0.780), OVG (r = 0.776), and OBG (r = 0.791) models for BMI subgroups increased by 1.79%, 4.64%, and 8.22% respectively, and the reliabilities (NOG model: ICC = 0.755; OVG model: ICC = 0.765; OBG model: ICC = 0.779) increased by 3.18%, 3.27%, and 9.63%, respectively. These results suggested using separate models established in BMI stratifications can effectively improve the prediction of VO2max.",International Journal of Medical Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],066cdb7e-e208-48f2-a573-c3638ce71926,International Journal of Medical Sciences,1929 - 1941,19,N/A,2022,2022-10-31 00:00:00,4,52,"Fang Li, Cheng-Pang Yang, Cheng-You Wu, Chia-An Ho, Hung-Chih Yeh, Yuan-Shuo Chan, Wen-Sheng ChangChien, Chin-Shan Ho","2146328975, 35340512, 2151102932, 2149653880, 145485683, 4881470, 2134140687, 2256144995",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/053ce79596ea7bdcf63776c642e94f444cb3f97e,Medicine,2146328975

The experimental results prove that the reliability and validity of the second-level quantitative load scheme for power vehicles are better and can be used as the maximum oxygen uptake in the laboratory, directly tested with alternative submaximal solutions, and used for large-scale investigation of maximum oxygen uptake data. At the same time, since the load is submaximal, it can also be used to clinically assess the patient’s cardiorespiratory endurance.",Advances in Multimedia,,,37555ef6-5b69-4ae8-a9b3-f2052c7552a5,Advances in Multimedia,,,Unknown,2022,2022-05-19 00:00:00,2,29,J.

The typical mobile-based HRV device simply records interbeat intervals, without differentiation between noise or arrythmia as can be done with an electrocardiogram (ECG). The intent of this report is to validate a new single channel ECG device, the Movesense Medical sensor, against a conventional 12 channel ECG. A heterogeneous group of 21 participants performed an incremental cycling ramp to failure with measurements of HRV, before (PRE), during (EX), and after (POST). Results showed excellent correlations between devices for linear indexes with Pearson’s r between 0.98 to 1.0 for meanRR, SDNN, RMSSD, and 0.95 to 0.97 for the non-linear index DFA a1 during PRE, EX, and POST. There was no significant difference in device specific meanRR during PRE and POST. Bland–Altman analysis showed high agreement between devices (PRE and POST: meanRR bias of 0.0 and 0.4 ms, LOA of 1.9 to −1.8 ms and 2.3 to −1.5; EX: meanRR bias of 11.2 to 6.0 ms; LOA of 29.8 to −7.4 ms during low intensity exercise and 8.5 to 3.5 ms during high intensity exercise). The Movesense Medical device can be used in lieu of a reference ECG for the calculation of HRV with the potential to differentiate noise from atrial fibrillation and represents a significant advance in both a HR and HRV recording device in a chest belt form factor for lab-based or remote field-application.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,396,2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,27,74,"B.

However, the methodology underlying machine learning in spine research is often overlooked as the subject matter is quite novel and may be foreign to practicing spine surgeons. Improper application of machine learning is a significant bioethics challenge, given the potential consequences of over- or underestimating the results of such studies for clinical decision-making processes. Proper peer review of these publications requires a baseline familiarity of the language associated with machine learning, and how it differs from classical statistical analyses. This narrative review first introduces the overall field of machine learning and its role in artificial intelligence, and defines basic terminology. In addition, common modalities for applying machine learning, including classification and regression decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are examined in the context of examples gathered from the spine literature. Lastly, the ethical challenges associated with adapting machine learning for research related to patient care, as well as future perspectives on the potential use of machine learning in spine surgery, are discussed specifically.",Frontiers in Surgery,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",20f49295-6ad9-4d39-ac66-a41cd69f0e19,Frontiers in Surgery,,7,N/A,2020,2020-08-21 00:00:00,69,96,"Michael Chang, J.

A central question of GPCR drug discovery is to understand what determines the agonism or antagonism of ligands which bind them. Ligands exert their action via the interactions in the ligand binding pocket. We hypothesised that there is a common set of receptor interactions made by ligands of diverse structures that mediate their action and that among a large dataset of different ligands, the functionally important interactions will be over-represented. We computationally docked ~2700 known β2AR ligands to multiple β2AR structures, generating ca 75,000 docking poses and predicted all atomic interactions between the receptor and the ligand. We used machine learning (ML) techniques to identify specific interactions that correlate with the agonist or antagonist activity of these ligands. The interpretation of ML analysis in human understandable form allowed us to construct an exquisitely detailed structure-activity relationship that identifies small changes to the ligands that invert their activity and thus helps to guide the drug discovery process. This approach can be readily applied to any drug target.",bioRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,Pharmacology Research & Perspectives,,10,N/A,2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,8,52,"Mireia Jiménez-Rosés, B.

The variations of the Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene locus are associated with intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the detailed molecular function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis remains obscure. Our study reveals the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and provides new clues for improving the palatability of meat and enhancing the nutritional value of pork for human health. Abstract The intramuscular fat is a major quality trait of meat, affecting sensory attributes such as flavor and texture. Several previous GWAS studies identified Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene as the candidate gene to regulate intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the underlying molecular function of ACSL4 in adipogenesis within pig skeletal muscle is not fully investigated. In this study, we isolated porcine endogenous intramuscular adipocyte progenitors and performed ACSL4 loss- and gain-of-function experiments during adipogenic differentiation. Our data showed that ACSL4 is a positive regulator of adipogenesis in intramuscular fat cells isolated from pigs. More interestingly, the enhanced expression of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipocytes could increase the cellular content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as gamma-L eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The above results not only confirmed the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and meat quality attributes, but also provided new clues for the improvement of the nutritional value of pork for human health.",Animals,,['JournalArticle'],2c30e84c-941b-45b8-b015-9284a1afdb14,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,,12,Unknown,2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,12,36,"H.

Thus, ACAA1 is an important regulator of lipid metabolism and plays an essential role in fatty acid oxidation and lipid metabolism. Our previous study findings revealed that ACAA1 is closely associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and fatty acid metabolism pathways, which are involved in fat deposition in sheep, leading to our hypothesis that ACAA1 may be involved in fat deposition by regulating lipid metabolism. However, the associated molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, to assess the potential function of ACAA1 in sheep preadipocyte differentiation, we knocked down and overexpressed ACAA1 in sheep preadipocytes and evaluated the pattern of ACAA1 gene expression during preadipocyte differentiation by qRT-PCR. ACAA1 was significantly expressed in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, and then its expression decreased. ACAA1 deficiency increased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content and promoted sheep preadipocyte differentiation, whereas ACAA1 overexpression inhibited adipogenesis and decreased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content. Simultaneously, we demonstrated that ACAA1 deficiency upregulated the expressions of the adipogenic marker genes PPARγ and C/EBPα in sheep preadipocytes, but ACAA1 overexpression inhibited the expressions of these markers, indicating that ACAA1 affects lipid metabolism by regulating adipogenic marker genes. Our results may promote a better understanding of the regulation of adipogenesis by ACAA1.",Frontiers in Genetics,journal,['JournalArticle'],9ec189b3-db0f-41d8-9c82-21ef5fa9b87e,Frontiers in Genetics,,12,N/A,2021,2021-06-21 00:00:00,25,39,"Yanli Wang, Xin Li, Yang Cao, C.

We enhance our method by incorporating deep learning techniques and multi-modal imaging data, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) images alongside fundus photographs, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of retinal pathology. The advanced EDL integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms with Capsule Networks (CapsNet) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for more nuanced feature extraction and classification. We introduce a novel ensemble adaptive weighting approach that dynamically adjusts classifier weights based on performance across disease types and severity levels, significantly improving the algorithm's handling of complex and rare cases. To enhance model interpretability, we implement an explainable AI component that provides visual heatmaps of the most significant regions for each diagnosis to clinicians. We evaluate the enhanced EDL on a large, diverse dataset encompassing multiple retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma, across various ethnicities and age groups.

Previous work in cyber bullying detection is often confronted with limitations in accurately detecting abusive behavior because of the intricacies in cyber space and evolution of cyber bullying practices. A new approach of Cyber bullying detection and classification network (CBDC- Net) for improving the effectiveness of detection of cyber bullying in OSNs based on natural language processing features, feature selection techniques, and deep learning algorithms is also presented in this study. CBDC-Net can overcome these challenges to existing detection methods of cyber bullying using innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning approaches. In the data preprocessing step, CBDC-Net filter and normalize the text data that is openly collected from OSNs. After that, CBDC-Net extracts features using a Synonym Level N-Gram (SLNG) approach and it incorporates both the word and character-based information to make the synonyms of text much better than the other method. After that, CSI of CBDC-Net applied Textual Similarity Resilient Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (TSR-SCSO) for feature selection to give an iterative value of their features’ importance level to detect cyber bullying. Last, in CBDC-Net, a Recurrent Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)Neural Network for classification (RBLNN) is used as classification approach is applied, which recognizes the sequential nature of textual data enabling proper distinction between cyber bullying cases.

Video Analytics for human action recognition is given significance due to its utility. However, it is very challenging to analyze live-streaming videos to identify human actions across the frames in the video. The literature showed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among computer vision applications' most popular deep learning algorithms. Another important observation is that Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) architecture with deep learning has the potential to leverage effectiveness in applications using computer vision. Inspired by this finding, we created a GAN-based framework (called HARGAN) in this research for human activity identification from surveillance films. The framework exploits a retrained deep learning model known as ResNet50 and convolutional LSTM for better performance in action recognition. Our framework has two critical functionalities: feature learning and human action recognition. The ResNet50 model achieves the former, while the GAN-based convolutional LSTM model achieves the latter. We proposed an algorithm called the Generative Adversarial Approach for Human Action Recognition (GAA-HAR) to realize the framework. We used a benchmark dataset known as UCF50, which is extensively used in studies on human action identification. Based on our experimental findings, the suggested framework performs better than the current baseline models like CNN, LSTM, and convolutional LSTM, with the highest accuracy of 97.73%.

The inherent diversity within IoT networks renders them suitable for a myriad of real-time applications, firmly embedding them into the fabric of daily life. While IoT devices streamline various activities, their susceptibility to security threats is a glaring concern. Current inadequacies in security measures render IoT networks vulnerable, presenting an enticing target for attackers. This study suggests a novel dealing to address this challenge through the execution of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) leveraging superior deep learning models. Inspired by the benefits of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), we introduce the Genetic Bee LSTM(GBLSTM) networks for the development of intelligent IDS capable of detecting a wide range of cyber-attacks targeting IoT area. The methodology comprises four key execution: (i) collection of unit for profiling normal IoT device behavior, (ii) Identification of malicious devices during an attack, (iii) Prediction of attack types implemented in the network. Intensive experimentations of the suggested IDS are conducted using various validation methods and prominent metrics across different IoT threat scenarios.

Most machine detection methods are constrained by congenital observations, although computers have been utilized in several recent research studies to diagnose AD. In AD, the hippocampus is usually the first part of the brain to be affected. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (SMRI) can be used to assist in diagnosing AD by measuring the hippocampus’s form and volume (MRI). The information encoded by these attributes is restricted and may be affected by segmentation problems. These traits are also extracted independently of the classification, which could result in lower-than-desired classification accuracy. Researchers in this study used structural MRI data to develop a deep learning framework for combined automatic hippocampus segmentation and AD categorization. Multi-task deep learning (MTDL) is used to learn hippocampus segmentation simultaneously. The hyperparameter optimization of the CNN model (capsule network) for illness classification is then carried out using the deer hunting optimization (DHO) technique. ADNI-standardized MRI datasets have been used to test the suggested method, and it is accurate.

Devices can minimize interference and optimize bandwidth usage by using directional antennas and by avoiding overlapping communication ranges. In addition, devices need to carefully manage their use of resources, such as bandwidth and energy. Bandwidth is limited in wireless personal area networks (WPANs), so devices need to carefully select which data to send and receive. In this paper, an intelligent performance analysis of energy‐efficient resource optimization model has been proposed for device‐to‐device (D2D) communication in fifth‐generation (5G) WPAN. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation in D2D communication is important because it helps reduce energy consumption and extend the lifespan of devices that are communicating with each other. By allocating resources in an efficient manner, communication between two devices can be optimized for maximum efficiency. This helps reduce the amount of energy needed to power the communication, as well as the amount of energy needed to power the device that is communicating with another device. Additionally, efficient resource allocation helps reduce the overall cost of communication, as the use of fewer resources results in a lower overall cost. The proposed efficient resource allocation helps reduce the environmental impact of communication, as less energy is used for communication. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation model (EERAM) has reached 92.97% of energy allocation, 88.72% of power allocation, 87.79% of bandwidth allocation, 87.93% of spectrum allocation, 88.43% of channel allocation, 25.47% of end‐to‐end delay, 94.33% of network data speed, and 90.99% of network throughput.",International Journal of Communication Systems,journal,['JournalArticle'],657efb9d-473f-4e6b-b416-eaa71d96e4dd,International Journal of Communication Systems,,36,N/A,2023,2023-05-22 00:00:00,64,40,"J.

Manual logging of drill holes can be difficult to exploit as the results may not be comparable between holes due to the subjective nature of geological logging. Exploration and mining companies commonly collect geochemical or mineralogical data from diamond drill core or drill chips; however, manual interpretation of multivariate data can be slow and challenging; therefore, automation of any of the steps in the interpretation process would be valuable. Hyperspectral analysis of drill chips provides a relatively inexpensive method of collecting very detailed information rapidly and consistently. However, the challenge of such data is the high dimensionality of the data’s variables in comparison to the number of samples. Hyperspectral data is usually processed to produce mineral abundances generally involving a range of assumptions. This paper presents the results of testing a new fast and objective methodology to identify the lithological boundaries from high dimensional hyperspectral data. This method applies a quadrant scan analysis to recurrence plots. The results, applied to nickel laterite deposits from New Caledonia, demonstrate that this method can identify transitions in the downhole data. These are interpreted as reflecting mineralogical changes that can be used as an aid in geological logging to improve boundary detection.",Minerals,journal,,05479075-64ee-4b95-b9a7-023afff1b556,Minerals,,,N/A,2021,2021-12-29 00:00:00,4,25,"Ayham A.

However, large multi-element data sets are slow and challenging to interpret without using some form of automated analysis, such as mathematical, statistical or machine learning techniques. Automated analysis techniques also have the advantage in that they are repeatable and can provide consistent results, even for very large data sets. In this paper, an automated litho-geochemical interpretation workflow is demonstrated, which includes data exploration and data preparation using appropriate compositional data-analysis techniques. Multiscale analysis using a modified wavelet tessellation has been applied to the data to provide coherent geological domains. Unsupervised machine learning (clustering) has been used to provide a first-pass classification. The results are compared with the detailed geologist’s logs. The comparison shows how the integration of automated analysis of geochemical data can be used to enhance traditional geological logging and demonstrates the identification of new geological units from the automated litho-geochemical logging that were not apparent from visual logging but are geochemically distinct. KEY POINTS To reduce computational complexity and facilitate interpretation, a subset of geochemical elements is selected, and then a centred log-ratio transform is applied. The wavelet tessellation method is used to domain the drill holes into rock units at a range of scales. Several clustering methods were tested to identify distinct rock units in the samples and multiscale domains for classification.

One important step in the area of manufacturing is feature recognition that aims to detect all the machining features from a 3-D model. In this research area, recognizing and locating a wide variety of highly intersecting features are extremely challenging as the topology information of features is substantially damaged because of the feature intersection. Motivated by the single shot multibox detector (SSD), this article presents a novel deep learning approach named SsdNet to tackle the machining feature localization and recognition problem. The typical SSD is designed for 2-D image objection detection rather than 3-D feature recognition. Therefore, the network architecture and output of SSD are modified to fulfil the purpose of this research. In addition, some advanced techniques are also utilized to further enhance the recognition performance. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art feature recognition performance (95.20% F-score), localization performance (90.62% F-score), and recognition efficiency (243.85 ms per model).",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],2135230a-3b24-4b71-9583-60624389377a,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,3292-3302,17,N/A,2021,2021-05-01 00:00:00,26,37,"Peizhi Shi, Q.

This region experiences groundwater ecosystem degradation as a result of the rapid conversion of rural agricultural land to urban areas under chronic drought conditions. This study aims to enhance Groundwater Pollution Risk (GwPR) mapping by integrating the DRASTIC index with machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), alongside hydrogeochemical investigations, to promote sustainable water management in Kerman Province. The RF model achieved the highest accuracy with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.995 in predicting GwPR, outperforming BRT (0.988), SVM (0.977), MARS (0.951), and GLM (0.887). The RF-based map identified new high-vulnerability zones in the northeast and northwest and showed an expanded moderate vulnerability zone, covering 48.46% of the study area. Analysis revealed exceedances of WHO standards for total hardness (TH), sodium, sulfates, chlorides, and electrical conductivity (EC) in these high-vulnerability areas, indicating contamination from mineralized aquifers and unsustainable agricultural practices. The findings underscore the RF model’s effectiveness in groundwater prediction and highlight the need for stricter monitoring and management, including regulating groundwater extraction and improving water use efficiency in riverine aquifers.",Water,journal,['JournalArticle'],2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2024,2024-09-27 00:00:00,10,70,"Mortaza Tavakoli, Zeynab Karimzadeh Motlagh, M.

Language identification (“LI”) is the problem of determining the natural language that a document or part thereof is written in. Automatic LI has been extensively researched for over fifty years. Today, LI is a key part of many text processing pipelines, as text processing techniques generally assume that the language of the input text is known. Research in this area has recently been especially active. This article provides a brief history of LI research, and an extensive survey of the features and methods used in the LI literature. We describe the features and methods using a unified notation, to make the relationships between methods clearer. We discuss evaluation methods, applications of LI, as well as off-the-shelfLI systems that do not require training by the end user.

Each type of bark made by dogs has a distinct context. The classification of dog bark pattern will aid in the understanding of barking action. In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used to analyze the pattern of barking from two different dog species: Rajapalayam Hound and Kombai Hound. The objective is to find the context of the dog barking pattern based on various real-time scenarios, including whether the dogs are alone, looking at strangers, or showing an eagerness to fight. The barks of the dogs were recorded inside the house under different scenarios, such as while identifying the owner or strangers. Machine learning algorithms, such as the reinforcement learning method, were used in predicting and classifying the dog sounds. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning that will generate the next best action for the given state. It is a model-free learning used to find the best course of dog action for the given current state of the dog. The Q-learning algorithm had been used in improving the prediction of dog sounds by updating the values of learning, where the values with the highest reward were taken into consideration. In total, 6171 barks were collected from the dogs chosen for study, and the proposed approach achieved a correct prediction accuracy of 85.19% of the dog sounds.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2022,2022-10-21 00:00:00,2,40,"Prabu Mohandas, Jerline Sheebha Anni, K.

In this work, we propose a deep-learning-assisted implementation incorporating a wearable device, a base station, a mobile application, and a cloud-based infrastructure that can first monitor in real-time the activity, the audio signals, and the location of a SaR dog, and second, recognize and alert the rescuing team whenever the SaR dog spots a victim. For this purpose, we employed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) both for the activity recognition and the sound classification, which are trained using data from inertial sensors, such as 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope and from the wearable’s microphone, respectively. The developed deep learning models were deployed on the wearable device, while the overall proposed implementation was validated in two discrete search and rescue scenarios, managing to successfully spot the victim (i.e., obtained F1-score more than 99%) and inform the rescue team in real-time for both scenarios.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,396,2022,2022-01-27 00:00:00,25,52,"P.

With many independent teams working in different research areas, shared standards become an essential safeguard to ensure compliance with state-of-the-art methods allowing appropriate comparison of results across studies and potential integration and combination of extraction and recognition systems. In this paper we propose a basic standard acoustic parameter set for various areas of automatic voice analysis, such as paralinguistic or clinical speech analysis. In contrast to a large brute-force parameter set, we present a minimalistic set of voice parameters here. These were selected based on a) their potential to index affective physiological changes in voice production, b) their proven value in former studies as well as their automatic extractability, and c) their theoretical significance. The set is intended to provide a common baseline for evaluation of future research and eliminate differences caused by varying parameter sets or even different implementations of the same parameters. Our implementation is publicly available with the openSMILE toolkit. Comparative evaluations of the proposed feature set and large baseline feature sets of INTERSPEECH challenges show a high performance of the proposed set in relation to its size.",IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,journal,['JournalArticle'],a88e2a6c-903f-42e1-8dfc-f2547e32020a,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,190-202,7,N/A,2016,2016-04-01 00:00:00,1428,73,"F.

The use of NIR spectra, therefore, requires a preprocessing step. This article reviews the main preprocessing methods in the light of aquaphotomics. Simple methods for visualizing the spectra are proposed in order to guide the user in the choice of the best preprocessing. The most common chemometrics preprocessing are presented and illustrated by three real datasets. Some preprocessing aims to produce a spectrum as close as possible to the absorbance that would have been measured under ideal conditions and is very useful for the establishment of an aquagram. Others, dedicated to the improvement of the resolution of the spectra, are very useful for the identification of the peaks. Finally, special attention is given to the problem of reducing multiplicative effects and to the potential pitfalls of some very popular methods in chemometrics.

In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus‐associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.",Ca,journal,['JournalArticle'],7777b179-7a66-44e1-bcc7-b454f2057262,CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians,17 - 48,73,N/A,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,9888,124,"R.

Here, we describe the technical details of the implementation of fluorescence lifetime and diffuse reflectance measurements by the system, equipped with an original needle optical probe, compatible with the 17.5G biopsy needle standard. The fluorescence lifetime measurements observed by the setup were verified in fresh solutions of NADH and FAD++, and then applied in a murine model for the characterisation of inoculated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent liver tissue. The technique, applied in vivo and in situ and supplemented by measurements of blood oxygen saturation, made it possible to reveal statistically significant transformation in the set of measured parameters linked with the cellular pools of NADH and NADPH. In the animal model, we demonstrate that the characteristic changes in registered fluorescent parameters can be used to reliably distinguish the HCC tissue, liver tissue in the control, and the metabolically changed liver tissues of animals with the developed HCC tumour. For further transition to clinical applications, the optical biopsy system was tested during the routing procedure of the PNB in humans with suspected HCC. The comparison of the data from murine and human HCC tissues suggests that the tested animal model is generally representative in the sense of the registered fluorescence lifetime parameters, while statistically significant differences between their absolute values can still be observed.",Biomedical Optics Express,journal,['JournalArticle'],7e331686-6620-4481-a3d5-5effffe9ab83,Biomedical optics express,"

ff15e5a042c5a987b20c13377894762e70f48175,10.1002/asi.24493,Lexical data augmentation for sentiment analysis,"Machine learning methods, especially deep learning models, have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks including sentiment analysis. However, deep learning models are more demanding for training data. Data augmentation techniques are widely used to generate new instances based on modifications to existing data or relying on external knowledge bases to address annotated data scarcity, which hinders the full potential of machine learning techniques. This paper presents our work using part‐of‐speech (POS) focused lexical substitution for data augmentation (PLSDA) to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms in sentiment analysis. We exploit POS information to identify words to be replaced and investigate different augmentation strategies to find semantically related substitutions when generating new instances. The choice of POS tags as well as a variety of strategies such as semantic‐based substitution methods and sampling methods are discussed in detail. Performance evaluation focuses on the comparison between PLSDA and two previous lexical substitution‐based data augmentation methods, one of which is thesaurus‐based, and the other is lexicon manipulation based. Our approach is tested on five English sentiment analysis benchmarks: SST‐2, MR, IMDB, Twitter, and AirRecord. Hyperparameters such as the candidate similarity threshold and number of newly generated instances are optimized. Results show that six classifiers (SVM, LSTM, BiLSTM‐AT, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers [BERT], XLNet, and RoBERTa) trained with PLSDA achieve accuracy improvement of more than 0.6% comparing to two previous lexical substitution methods averaged on five benchmarks. Introducing POS constraint and well‐designed augmentation strategies can improve the reliability of lexical data augmentation methods. Consequently, PLSDA significantly improves the performance of sentiment analysis algorithms.",J. Assoc. Inf. Sci.

In NLP similar results are reported most commonly for low data regimes, non-pretrained models, or situationally for pretrained models. In this paper we ask how effective these techniques really are when applied to pretrained transformers. Using two popular varieties of task-agnostic data augmentation (not tailored to any particular task), Easy Data Augmentation (Wei andZou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrichet al., 2015), we conduct a systematic examination of their effects across 5 classification tasks, 6 datasets, and 3 variants of modern pretrained transformers, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. We observe a negative result, finding that techniques which previously reported strong improvements for non-pretrained models fail to consistently improve performance for pretrained transformers, even when training data is limited. We hope this empirical analysis helps inform practitioners where data augmentation techniques may confer improvements.",Findings,journal,['JournalArticle'],479d5605-51be-4346-b1d6-4334084504df,,4401-4411,,N/A,2020,2020-10-05 00:00:00,80,35,"S.

477cc5801615317ab1fe5e4ca392ae78ccd68ff7,10.3389/frai.2021.622616,A Machine Learning Approach to Monitor the Emergence of Late Intrauterine Growth Restriction,"Late intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a fetal pathological condition characterized by chronic hypoxia secondary to placental insufficiency, resulting in an abnormal rate of fetal growth. This pathology has been associated with increased fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In standard clinical practice, late IUGR diagnosis can only be suspected in the third trimester and ultimately confirmed at birth. This study presents a radial basis function support vector machine (RBF-SVM) classification based on quantitative features extracted from fetal heart rate (FHR) signals acquired using routine cardiotocography (CTG) in a population of 160 healthy and 102 late IUGR fetuses. First, the individual performance of each time, frequency, and nonlinear feature was tested. To improve the unsatisfactory results of univariate analysis we firstly adopted a Recursive Feature Elimination approach to select the best subset of FHR-based parameters contributing to the discrimination of healthy vs. late IUGR fetuses. A fine tuning of the RBF-SVM model parameters resulted in a satisfactory classification performance in the training set (accuracy 0.93, sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.84). Comparable results were obtained when applying the model on a totally independent testing set. This investigation supports the use of a multivariate approach for the in utero identification of late IUGR condition based on quantitative FHR features encompassing different domains. The proposed model allows describing the relationships among features beyond the traditional linear approaches, thus improving the classification performance. This framework has the potential to be proposed as a screening tool for the identification of late IUGR fetuses.",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,,['JournalArticle'],6a8c0041-d0b7-4e32-b52c-33adef005c7e,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,,4,Unknown,2021,2021-03-08 00:00:00,20,51,"N.

The study employs the Su-Schrieffer–Heeger model along with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and frequency-domain analysis methods to analyze the Bloch-like oscillations. It is found that the fundamental frequencies of the current density agree well with the theoretical Bloch frequencies of the perfect crystals. The electron–phonon coupling is a key factor in inducing the deviation between the Bloch-like oscillation behavior in conjugated polymers and that in perfect superlattices. Moreover, the increase in lattice thermal fluctuation is not conducive to the maintenance of Bloch-like oscillation behavior in conjugated polymers.",ACS Omega,,['JournalArticle'],d516f81c-009b-445d-b748-c827efa137d3,ACS Omega,40456 - 40462,8,Unknown,2023,2023-10-17 00:00:00,2,31,Sutao Sun,2157769282,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea867699ca1ad6ec6326d53dbccfcea1c51e6411,"Medicine, Physics",2157769282

Trajectories are treated as time-series data, with the features for clustering selected by variance mapping of normalized data. The L2-norm and dynamic time warping are proposed as suitable similarity measures for calculating the distance matrices, and these are clustered using the unsupervised density-based DBSCAN algorithm. The silhouette coefficient and the number of trajectories classified as noise are used as quality measures for the clustering. The ability of clustering to provide rapid overview of large and complex trajectory data sets, and its utility for extracting chemical and physical insight, is demonstrated on trajectories corresponding to the photochemical ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, noting that the clustering can be used to generate reduced dimensionality representations in an unbiased manner.",Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",05f4640f-1261-4186-8153-0cb50b1169b3,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,6126 - 6138,19,N/A,2023,2023-09-13 00:00:00,3,89,"Kyle Acheson, A.

1897d451b669ea9e69484a31a44aa2175cb33449,10.3389/fmolb.2020.00106,On Calculating Free Energy Differences Using Ensembles of Transition Paths,"The free energy of a process is the fundamental quantity that determines its spontaneity or propensity at a given temperature. In particular, the binding free energy of a drug candidate to its biomolecular target is used as an objective quantity in drug design. Recently, binding kinetics—rates of association (kon) and dissociation (koff)—have also demonstrated utility for their ability to predict efficacy and in some cases have been shown to be more predictive than the binding free energy alone. Some methods exist to calculate binding kinetics from molecular simulations, although these are typically more difficult to calculate than the binding affinity as they depend on details of the transition path ensemble. Assessing these rate constants can be difficult, due to uncertainty in the definition of the bound and unbound states, large error bars and the lack of experimental data. As an additional consistency check, rate constants from simulation can be used to calculate free energies (using the log of their ratio) which can then be compared to free energies obtained experimentally or using alchemical free energy perturbation. However, in this calculation it is not straightforward to account for common, practical details such as the finite simulation volume or the particular definition of the “bound” and “unbound” states. Here we derive a set of correction terms that can be applied to calculations of binding free energies using full reactive trajectories. We apply these correction terms to revisit the calculation of binding free energies from rate constants for a host-guest system that was part of a blind prediction challenge, where significant deviations were observed between free energies calculated with rate ratios and those calculated from alchemical perturbation. The correction terms combine to significantly decrease the error with respect to computational benchmarks, from 3.4 to 0.76 kcal/mol. Although these terms were derived with weighted ensemble simulations in mind, some of the correction terms are generally applicable to free energies calculated using physical pathways via methods such as Markov state modeling, metadynamics, milestoning, or umbrella sampling.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],a75714cc-ae87-4828-a0a2-e7f8d57a5632,Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,,7,N/A,2020,2020-06-05 00:00:00,33,73,"Robert Hall, Tom Dixon, Alex Dickson","2069314965, 2067829627, 48487951",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1897d451b669ea9e69484a31a44aa2175cb33449,"Chemistry, Medicine, Physics",2069314965

Thus, the modelling, characterization, classification, diagnosis, and analysis of such mental disorders bears great significance in medical research. Electroencephalogram records provide important information to improve clinical diagnosis and are very useful in the scientific community. In this work, electroencephalogram records and patient data from the Hospital Virgen de la Luz in Cuenca (Spain) were processed for a correct classification of bipolar disorders. This work implemented an innovative radial basis function-based neural network employing a fuzzy means algorithm. The results show that the proposed method is an effective approach for discrimination of two kinds of classes, i.e., bipolar disorder patients and healthy persons. The proposed algorithm achieved the best performance compared with other machine learning techniques such as Bayesian linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian naive Bayes, decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, or support vector machine, showing a very high accuracy close to 97%. Therefore, the neural network technique presented could be used as a new tool for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, considering the possibility of integrating this method into medical software.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2022,2022-01-23 00:00:00,9,62,"M.

Currently, several approaches classified as electrical, magnetic, neuroimaging recordings and brain stimulations are available to obtain neural activity of the human brain. Among them, non-invasive methods like electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly employed, as they can provide a high degree of temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds) and acceptable space resolution. In addition, it is simple, quick, and does not create any physical harm or stress to patients. Concerning signal processing, once the neural signals are acquired, different procedures can be applied for feature extraction. In particular, brain signals are normally processed in time, frequency, and/or space domains. The features extracted are then used for signal classification depending on its characteristics such us the mean, variance or band power. The role of machine learning in this regard has become of key importance during the last years due to its high capacity to analyze complex amounts of data. The algorithms employed are generally classified in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement techniques. A deep review of the most used machine learning algorithms and the advantages/drawbacks of most used methods is presented. Finally, a study of these procedures utilized in a very specific and novel research field of electroencephalography, i.e., autobiographical memory deficits in schizophrenia, is outlined.",Electronics,journal,['Review'],ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2021,2021-12-05 00:00:00,32,47,"M.

This paper describes the development of a model for the turbulence spectrum measured by a short-range, continuous-wave lidar. The lidar performance was assessed by measurements conducted with two WindScanners in an open jet wind tunnel equipped with an active grid, for a range of different turbulent wind conditions. A one-dimensional hot wire anemometer was used as a reference for characterising the lidar turbulence measurement. In addition to addressing the statistics, the correlation between the time series and the mean error on the wind speed, the lidar measurement turbulence spectrum is compared with a theoretical spectrum using Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A theoretical model for the probe length averaging effect is applied in the frequency domain, using a Lorentzian filter in combination with generated white noise, and evaluated by qualitatively matching the lidar measurement spectrum. High goodness of fit coefficients and low mean absolute errors between hot wire and WindScanner were observed for the measured time series. The correlation showed an inverse relationship with the prevalent turbulence intensity in the flow for cases with a comparable power spectrum shape. Larger flow structures can be captured more accurately by the lidar, whereas small-scale turbulent flow structures are partly filtered out as a result of the lidars' probe volume averaging. It is demonstrated that an accurate way to define the frequency at which the lidar power spectrum starts to deviate from the hot wire reference spectrum is the point at which the coherence drops below 0.5. This coherence-based cut-off frequency increases linearly with the mean wind speed and is generally an order of magnitude lower than the probe length cut-off frequency, estimated according to a simple model based on Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A convincing match between the modelled and the actual WindScanner power spectrum was found for various different cases, which confirmed that the deviation of the lidar measurement power spectrum in the higher frequency range can be analytically explained and modelled as a combination of a Lorentzian probe length averaging effect and white noise in the lidar measurement.

The technique is applied after quality assurance/quality control (QAQC) processing to quantify residual error, both bias and random, from solid-body interference, shot noise, and any additional uncertainty introduced to the data from the QAQC process itself. The approach follows from the one-time construction of a high-dimensional parametric database of synthetic lidar spectra and subsequent processing with an existing QAQC technique. A model of the correspondence between the spectral shape and the associated residual errors due to non-ideal features is then developed for quantities of interest (QOIs) including the geometric median and spectral standard deviation of line-of-sight velocity. The model is preliminarily implemented within a neural network framework that is then applied in post-processing to sample returns from a DTU SpinnerLidar. The initial analysis uncovers the effects of specific sources of uncertainty in the context of both individual spectra and full-field maps of the measurement domain.

Interest is particularly directed at the structures and spectra which are influential for wake recovery and downstream turbine loading. This initial work is to determine the feasibility of using nacelle-mounted, continuous-wave lidars to measure and validate wake physics via comparisons of full actuator line simulation results with those obtained from a virtual lidar embedded within the computational domain. Analyses are conducted on the dominant large-scale flow structures via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and on the various scales of wake-added turbulence through spectral comparisons. The virtual lidar adequately reproduces spatial structures and energies compared to the full simulation results.

The consumer culture of livestream e-commerce is becoming popular in China. However, a report from Southern Finance Omnimedia Corp of China pointed out that among China's top 1,000 livestream sellers, the top 20 sellers have contributed to nearly half of the gross merchandise volume (GMV), using three major Chinese streaming platforms: Taobao, Douyin, and Kuaishou. Moreover, a novice in livestream e-commerce knows less about the important impact factors of the realm. Akin to the adage, “well aware is well prepared,” knowing more about the influencing factors of livestream e-commerce more will be the chances to promote the commercial value. A benchmark research is needed to systematically trace out the most important and influencing factors and to make possible the rising of selling with less effort, hence this study. The research intends to sort out the relevant influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce by reviewing previous related literature. Then, through the Delphi method, eight experts constructed the 14 main influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce. Through DEMATEL-ANP, we can not only find the key factors but also sort out the causal relationship between the main key factors, forming a preliminary evaluation model of the commercial value of livestream sellers. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) of these impact factors found that “seller popularity” is the most critical factor affecting consumers’ shopping motivation. At the same time, product discounts, product quality, and the attractiveness of the sellers are being included in effects by the “seller popularity.” The investigation followed in this study revealed that characteristics of the livestream seller are one of the most influencing factor achieving a total weight of 0.3020, whereas the streaming platform is the least influencing factor (total weight is 0.1333). The assessment made the study explore the sustainability of livestream e-commerce in China, and the proposed evaluation model can be used for the preliminary business value evaluation of people engaged in livestream sellers and related industries.",Scientific Programming,journal,['Review'],d5b215f3-f737-45b2-875b-df309ce14c43,Scientific Programming,,,N/A,2022,2022-02-21 00:00:00,14,87,"Haonan Cheng, Yitian Huang, Jesheng Huang","2182553767, 115026140, 2155720642",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9710f7a0bf137cf2610bc6b1ebcf5319b1cb711e,"Business, Computer Science, Economics, Medicine",2182553767

The guidance of public opinion in the converged media environment is a new research topic. Users participate in the discussion of different media, and flow in and out from different media, which gradually generate a new complex dynamics model of the dissemination of public opinion information. An index system for evaluating the influence of converged media communication that combines the advantages of traditional media and new media is constructed. We use AHP to determine the index weights in the evaluation system and conduct consistency tests. The final weight of each media is determined through the combination of subjective and objective methods, which provides data supports for later determining the participation of various media in the dissemination process of public opinion information. Based on the SIR model, a UCIR (unknown-contact-infected-recovered) dynamic model is established. The simulation results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the UCIR model is 31.6% lower than that of the SIR model. Finally, by fixing the key parameters α, β, θ, ε, p, q in the UCIR model, and changing only one of them, we studied the effect of the transition probability between different states on the process of public opinion information transmission, and then proposed corresponding guidance. In addition, from the two perspectives of network media and government, the countermeasures and suggestions for the guidance of public opinion are proposed. We try to solve the problems of humanities and social sciences with the method of natural science. These research results can provide theoretical and methodological support for people to understand the law of public opinion information transmission and establish a guiding mechanism for public opinion information transmission.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,"

Reflectance indices obtained by an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Spec 4 hyperspectral spectrometer from tomato growth in two soil texture types exposed to four water stress levels (70–100% FC, 60–70% FC, 50–60% FC, and 40–50% FC) was deployed to schedule irrigation and management of crops’ water stress. The treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in a 2 × 4 factorial experiment. Water stress treatments were monitored with Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) every 12 h before and after irrigation to maintain soil water content at the desired (FC%). Soil electrical conductivity (Ec) was measured daily throughout the growth cycle of tomatoes in both soil types. Ec was revealing a strong correlation with water stress at R2 above 0.95 p < 0.001. Yield was measured at the end of the end of the growing season. The results revealed that yield had a high correlation with water stress at R2 = 0.9758 and 0.9816 p < 0.01 for sandy loam and silty loam soils, respectively. Leaf temperature (LT °C), relative leaf water content (RLWC), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), Leaf area index (LAI), were measured at each growth stage at the same time spectral reflectance data were measured throughout the growth period. Spectral reflectance indices used were grouped into three: (1) greenness vegetative indices; (2) water overtone vegetation indices; (3) Photochemical Reflectance Index centered at 570 nm (PRI570), and normalized PRI (PRInorm). These reflectance indices were strongly correlated with all four water stress indicators and yield. The results revealed that NDVI, RDVI, WI, NDWI, NDWI1640, PRI570, and PRInorm were the most sensitive indices for estimating crop water stress at each growth stage in both sandy loam and silty loam soils at R2 above 0.35. This study recounts the depth of 858 to 1640 nm band absorption to water stress estimation, comparing it to other band depths to give an insight into the usefulness of ground-based hyperspectral reflectance indices for assessing crop water stress at different growth stages in different soil types.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,396,2021,2021-08-24 00:00:00,28,76,"K.

Breeding programs are in search of new drought tolerant forage grass varieties, but those programs still rely on time-consuming and less consistent visual scoring by breeders. In this study, we evaluate whether Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing can complement or replace this visual breeder score. A field experiment was set up to test the drought tolerance of genotypes from three common forage types of two different species: Festuca arundinacea, diploid Lolium perenne and tetraploid Lolium perenne. Drought stress was imposed by using mobile rainout shelters. UAV flights with RGB and thermal sensors were conducted at five time points during the experiment. Visual-based indices from different colour spaces were selected that were closely correlated to the breeder score. Furthermore, several indices, in particular H and NDLab, from the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and CIELab (Commission Internationale de l’éclairage) colour space, respectively, displayed a broad-sense heritability that was as high or higher than the visual breeder score, making these indices highly suited for high-throughput field phenotyping applications that can complement or even replace the breeder score. The thermal-based Crop Water Stress Index CWSI provided complementary information to visual-based indices, enabling the analysis of differences in ecophysiological mechanisms for coping with reduced water availability between species and ploidy levels. All species/types displayed variation in drought stress tolerance, which confirms that there is sufficient variation for selection within these groups of grasses. Our results confirmed the better drought tolerance potential of Festuca arundinacea, but also showed which Lolium perenne genotypes are more tolerant.",Remote Sensing,journal,['JournalArticle'],8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

Utilizing the rule of deep learning (DL), we introduce and fine-tune two robust frameworks, ResNet 50 and Inception V3, specifically designed for the classification of brain MRI images. Building upon the previous success of ResNet 50 and Inception V3 in classifying other medical imaging datasets, our investigation encompasses datasets with distinct characteristics, including one with four classes and another with two. The primary contribution of our research lies in the meticulous curation of these paired datasets. We have also integrated essential techniques, including Early Stopping and ReduceLROnPlateau, to refine the model through hyperparameter optimization. This involved adding extra layers, experimenting with various loss functions and learning rates, and incorporating dropout layers and regularization to ensure model convergence in predictions. Furthermore, strategic enhancements, such as customized pooling and regularization layers, have significantly elevated the accuracy of our models, resulting in remarkable classification accuracy. Notably, the pairing of ResNet 50 with the Nadam optimizer yields extraordinary accuracy rates, reaching 99.34% for gliomas, 93.52% for meningiomas, 98.68% for non-tumorous images, and 97.70% for pituitary tumors. These results underscore the transformative potential of our custom-made approach, achieving an aggregate testing accuracy of 97.68% for these four distinct classes. In a two-class dataset, Resnet 50 with the Adam optimizer excels, demonstrating better precision, recall, F1 score, and an overall accuracy of 99.84%. Moreover, it attains perfect per-class accuracy of 99.62% for ‘Tumor Positive’ and 100% for ‘Tumor Negative’, underscoring a remarkable advancement in the realm of brain tumor categorization.

Big data is a crucial aspect of modern computing, and the choice of processing framework can significantly impact performance and efficiency. The technical revolution of big data has changed how organizations handle and value large databases. As data quantities expand quickly, effective and scalable data processing systems are essential. MapReduce and Apache Spark are two of the most popular large data processing techniques. This study compares these two frameworks to determine their merits, shortcomings, and applicability for big data applications. Nearly quintillion bytes of data are created daily. Approximately 90% of data was produced in the previous two years. At this stage, data comes from temperature sensors, social media, movies, photographs, transaction records (like banking records), mobile phone conversations, GPS signals, etc. In this article, all key big data technologies are introduced. This document compares all big data technologies and discusses their merits and downsides. Run trials using multiple data sets of varying sizes to validate and explain the study. Graphical depiction shows how one tool outperforms others for given data. Big Data is data generated by the rapid usage of the internet, sensors, and heavy machinery, with great volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Numbers, photos, videos, and text are omnipresent in every sector. Due to the pace and amount of data generation, the computing system struggles to manage large data. Data is stored in a distributed architectural file system due to its size and complexity. Big distributed file systems, which must be fault-tolerant, adaptable, and scalable, make complicated data analysis dangerous and time-consuming. Big data collection is called ‘datafication’. Big data is ‘datafied’ for productivity.

Based on a large cohort of newly diagnosed CLL/SLL patients from China, we investigated immunophenotypes, genetic abnormalities, and their correlations. Eighty-four percent of the CLL/SLL patients showed typical immunophenotypes with scores of 4 or 5 points in the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) scoring system (classic group), and the remaining 16% of patients were atypical with scores lower than 4 points (atypical group). Trisomy 12 and variants of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, ATM, and MYD88 were the most recurrent genetic aberrations. Additionally, unsupervised genomic analysis based on molecular genetics revealed distinctive characteristics of MYD88 variants in CLL/SLL. By overlapping different correlation grouping analysis from genetics to immunophenotypes, the results showed MYD88 variants to be highly related to atypical CLL/SLL immunophenotypes. Furthermore, compared with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the genetic landscape showed potential value in clinical differential diagnosis of atypical CLL/SLL and MCL patients. These results reveal immunophenotypic and genetic features, and may provide insights into the tumorigenesis and clinical management of Chinese CLL/SLL patients.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],7fe84005-586f-4604-98ee-fa60fe8ae618,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,12,N/A,2023,2023-04-01 00:00:00,2,32,"Yafei Mu, Xijie Fan, Tao Chen, Yuhuan Meng, Junwei Lin, Jiecheng Yuan, Shihui Yu, Yuxin Chen, Lingling Liu","2174182590, 2148285161, 2213345932, 34437182, 2213355286, 2174199158, 2152831865, 2213150142, 49479926",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e45c9012f7d222231cbb1018e7bf317ca4c3640,Medicine,2174182590

Their use guides the identification of pathogenic variants amidst the sea of benign variation present in every human genome, and supports the discovery of new disease–gene relationships. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is currently the largest and most widely used publicly available collection of population variation from harmonized sequencing data. The data is available through the online gnomAD browser (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) that enables rapid and intuitive variant analysis. This review provides guidance on the content of the gnomAD browser, and its usage for variant and gene interpretation.

Germline variants can influence treatment response and contribute to the development of treatment-related second neoplasms, especially in childhood leukemia. We aimed to analyze the genomes of patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders for the discovery of genes enriched in rare pathogenic variants. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in germline rare and dysfunctional variants. Additionally, we detected rare and likely pathogenic variants associated with disease prognosis and potential druggability, indicating a relevant role of these events in the variability of cancer phenotypes. Abstract There is growing evidence indicating the implication of germline variation in cancer predisposition and prognostication. Here, we describe an analysis of likely disruptive rare variants across the genomes of 726 patients with B-cell lymphoid neoplasms. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in rare dysfunctional variants, both of which participate in the regulation of oxidative stress pathways (CHMP6 and GSTA4). Additionally, we detected 1675 likely disrupting variants in genes associated with cancer, of which 44.75% were novel events and 7.88% were protein-truncating variants. Among these, the most frequently affected genes were ATM, BIRC6, CLTCL1A, and TSC2. Homozygous or germline double-hit variants were detected in 28 cases, and coexisting somatic events were observed in 17 patients, some of which affected key lymphoma drivers such as ATM, KMT2D, and MYC. Finally, we observed that variants in six different genes were independently associated with shorter survival in CLL. Our study results support an important role for rare germline variation in the pathogenesis and prognosis of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms.",Cancers,journal,['JournalArticle'],d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,13,N/A,2021,2021-03-01 00:00:00,13,88,"A.

07a5a4418c0b84a88c2a03487affcccc4bf245e7,10.2196/17125,A Deep Artificial Neural Network−Based Model for Prediction of Underlying Cause of Death From Death Certificates: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Background Coding of underlying causes of death from death certificates is a process that is nowadays undertaken mostly by humans with potential assistance from expert systems, such as the Iris software. It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the CépiDc (Centre d’épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de Décès) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner. Objective This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death. Methods The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject’s age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject’s underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network−based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach’s superiority was assessed via bootstrap. Results The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010. Conclusions This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.",JMIR Medical Informatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],dc6419f3-98b3-4718-bba0-6b6d6c3d192b,JMIR Medical Informatics,,8,N/A,2020,2020-04-01 00:00:00,18,43,"Louis Falissard, C.

This work studies a mathematical problem motivated by the bi‐objective optimization of data‐parallel applications on such platforms for performance and energy. First, we formulate the problem and present an exact algorithm of polynomial complexity solving the problem where all the application profiles of objective type one are continuous and strictly increasing, and all the application profiles of objective type two are linear increasing. We then apply the algorithm to develop solutions for two related optimization problems of parallel applications on heterogeneous hybrid platforms, one for performance and dynamic energy and the other for performance and total energy. Our proposed solution methods are then employed to solve the two bi‐objective optimization problems for two data‐parallel applications, matrix multiplication and gene sequencing, on a hybrid platform employing five heterogeneous processors, namely, two different Intel multicore CPUs, an Nvidia K40c GPU, an Nvidia P100 PCIe GPU, and an Intel Xeon Phi.",Concurrency and Computation,journal,['JournalArticle'],312ca99c-9149-490d-813e-c60d5e949f65,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,,35,N/A,2022,2022-09-02 00:00:00,4,39,"Hamidreza Khaleghzadeh, Ravi Reddy, Alexey L.

The proposed system first uses the separability filter proposed by Fukui and Yamaguchi (Trans. IEICE Japan J80-D-II. 8, 2170-2177, 1997) to obtain the best object candidates and next, the system uses the Circular Hough Transform (CHT) to detect the presence of circular shape. The main contribution of this work consists of using together two different techniques in order to take advantages from the peculiarity of each of them. As the results of the experiments, the object detection rate of the proposed system was 96% for 25 images by moving the circle template every 20 pixels to right and down.",,Unknown,,Unknown,American Journal of Applied Sciences,1606-1609,2,Unknown,2005,2005-12-31 00:00:00,158,8,"M.

The main objectives of this study were to use a feature engineering approach to incorporate clinical expert knowledge prior to applying machine learning techniques, and to assess the impact of the approach on model complexity and performance. Four machine learning models were trained to predict mortality with a severe asthma case study. Experiments to select fewer input features based on a discriminative score showed low to moderate precision for discovering clinically meaningful triplets, indicating that discriminative score alone cannot replace clinical input. When compared to baseline machine learning models, we found a decrease in model complexity with use of fewer features informed by discriminative score and filtering of laboratory features with clinical input. We also found a small difference in performance for the mortality prediction task when comparing baseline ML models to models that used filtered features. Encoding demographic and triplet information in ML models with filtered features appeared to show performance improvements from the baseline. These findings indicated that the use of filtered features may reduce model complexity, and with little impact on performance.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,15,N/A,2020,2020-04-23 00:00:00,28,29,"Kenneth D Roe, Vibhu Jawa, X.

A panel regression model analyzes trade between Russia and its 15 top trading partners, exploring both direct and indirect effects. The analysis focuses on how accumulated foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange rate fluctuations mediate these relationships. The findings reveal that global geopolitical instability decrease Russian trade by 0.0558. Interestingly, this negative impact is partially mediated by a decrease in FDI (-0.0805). This aligns with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, which show a significant negative effect of global geopolitical instability on FDI (-1.209). This suggests that FDI acts as a key transmitter of the negative effects of global instability on Russian trade. The role of exchange rate fluctuations, however, is more complex. While the Sobel Test indicated a negative indirect effect, the SEM analysis shows a positive indirect effect through exchange rate fluctuations on trade. This suggests potentially countervailing effects of currency fluctuations, with depreciation potentially incentivizing exports while appreciation might make imports cheaper. The impact of country-specific geopolitical instability varies depending on the context. Industries like food products and textiles are significantly affected by geopolitical instability increase, while sectors such as fuels, metals and raw materials show resilience. Close trading partners are less affected by global instability but suffer from partner- specific instability. Geographically, Western Europe benefits from global instability but faces challenges from partner-specific instability, contrasting with Eastern Europe and Asia. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how geopolitical instability, mediated by FDI and exchange rates, shapes Russia's trade performance.",International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],dc8f13a2-4e40-4171-8418-7e5648ecf441,International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology (IJISRT),,,N/A,2024,2024-08-03 00:00:00,929,17,Pavel Talamanov,2200259444,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9b0bcfe881b6c90f76dfe7a913b0e022682ceb5,"Economics, Political Science",2200259444

A detailed case study of deviations, out-of-Specification and CAPA generation is beneficial for improving pharmaceutical capabilities and understanding the documentation associated with a quality management system. It is essential for understanding deviations and out-of-spec in the pharmaceutical industry. The quality of medicines means that they meet the required specifications. The quality management system in the pharmaceutical industry is essential because the drugs or pharmaceutical products are delivered directly to the customer's body. Therefore, identity, purity, safety, and the quality of the products are critical. A Deviation can define as ""a deviation from an approved instruction or established standard"" The deviation process helps identify potential risks to product quality and patient safety and establish the root cause. Once the root cause identifies, appropriate corrective and preventive actions take to prevent reoccurrence. OOS defines as ""A result that is outside the specifications or acceptance criteria established by the manufacturer or laboratory"" As the industry moves to newer and more complicated products, quality control procedures must be in place to ensure consistent product quality.

In this age of Industry 4.0 the fruit sorting is an important part in the food processing wherein this work plays a vital role. In this study, a solution for the detection and classification of apple fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. Deep learning models offer promise for automating disease identification using fruit images, but encounter obstacles such as therequirement for extensive training data, computational complexity, and the risk of overfitting. This study introduces an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture aimed at addressing these challenges by incorporating a reduced number of layers, thus alleviating computational burdens while maintaining performance. Additionally, augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are employed to diversify the training set without additional image acquisition. Our CNN model is specifically trained to identify common apple crop diseases like Scab, Rot, and Blotch. Rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness ofour model, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 95.37%. Significantly, our model demonstrates reduced storage requirements and faster execution times compared to existing deep CNN architectures, enabling deployment on handheld devices and resource-limited environments. While other CNN models may offer similar accuracy levels, our approach emphasizes efficiency and resource optimization, rendering it practical for real-world applications in agriculture. Furthermore, our CNN model exhibits resilience to environmental variations and imaging parameters, enhancing its applicability across diverse agricultural settings. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the approach developed in this experimental work contributes to modernizing fruits and vegetables sorting operations in food processing, crop management practices thus promoting agricultural sustainability. The scalability and portability of our model make it suitable for deployment in both small-scale farms and large-scale agricultural operations.",International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],dc8f13a2-4e40-4171-8418-7e5648ecf441,International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology (IJISRT),,,N/A,2024,2024-07-25 00:00:00,926,51,"Arpit Patidar, Abir Chakravorty","2301073891, 95703942",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d2c38b39f73003ec23ee3e2382e319e20bd5d18,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science",2301073891

Here, we present decoupleR, a Bioconductor package containing computational methods to extract these activities within a unified framework. decoupleR allows us to flexibly run any method with a given resource, including methods that leverage mode of regulation and weights of interactions. Using decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of methods on transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments. Our findings suggest that simple linear models and the consensus score across methods perform better than other methods at predicting perturbed regulators. Availability and Implementation decoupleR is open source available in Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/decoupleR.html).

In this context, the present research comes to connect the local sustainable tourism development with the sporting events, and to come up with relevant proposals for the reference area, but also for their generalization in the whole tourist areas. Based on the research purpose, a quantitative research was conducted on a sample of 448 residents, randomly selected from a sampling frame. Several scales from previous studies were used to collect primary data, and they were adapted according to the research purpose. Research findings indicate that the acceptance of sustainable tourism development through sports can be predicted by several variables, such as the economic impact (b = 0.343), residents’ attitude towards sports events (b = 0.287), and citizens’ tendency to entrepreneurship (b = 0.113). Additionally, sports events affect the tendency of citizens towards entrepreneurship (r = 0.519, p < 0.01). In conclusion, the impact of sports events is multiple, and it affects many aspects of a tourism destination, and the effect of sports events on the destination is connected with the tendency of citizens towards entrepreneurship related to sports events.",Sustainability,journal,,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,N/A,2022,2022-04-07 00:00:00,22,71,"G.

This ecosystem makes its presence felt in every aspect of our lives, along with all other emerging technologies. Unfortunately, despite the significant benefits brought by the IoT, the increased attack surface built upon it has become more critical than ever. Devices have limited resources and are not typically created with security features. Lately, a trend of botnet threats transitioning to the IoT environment has been observed, and an army of infected IoT devices can expand quickly and be used for effective attacks. Therefore, identifying proper solutions for securing IoT systems is currently an important and challenging research topic. Machine learning-based approaches are a promising alternative, allowing the identification of abnormal behaviors and the detection of attacks. This paper proposes an anomaly-based detection solution that uses unsupervised deep learning techniques to identify IoT botnet activities. An empirical evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on both balanced and unbalanced datasets to assess its threat detection capability. False-positive rate reduction and its impact on the detection system are also analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison with other unsupervised learning approaches is included. The experimental results reveal the performance of the proposed detection method.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2021,2021-08-04 00:00:00,48,44,"Ioana Apostol, Marius Preda, Constantin Nila, I.

However, its reliability has been a concern, possibly due to its high-dimensional nature. This study aims to quantitatively investigate the impact of randomly generated irrelevant features on MRI radiomics feature selection, modeling, and performance by progressively adding randomly generated features. Two multiparametric-MRI radiomics PC datasets were used (dataset 1 (n = 260), dataset 2 (n = 100)). The endpoint was to differentiate pathology-confirmed clinically significant (Gleason score (GS) ≥ 7) from insignificant (GS < 7) PC. Random features were generated at 12 levels with a 10% increment from 0% to 100% and an additional 5%. Three feature selection algorithms and two classifiers were used to build the models. The area under the curve and accuracy were used to evaluate the model’s performance. Feature importance was calculated to assess features’ contributions to the models. The metrics of each model were compared using an ANOVA test with a Bonferroni correction. A slight tendency to select more random features with the increasing number of random features introduced to the datasets was observed. However, the performance of the radiomics-built models was not significantly affected, which was partially due to the higher contribution of radiomics features toward the models compared to the random features. These reliability effects also vary among datasets. In conclusion, while the inclusion of additional random features may still slightly impact the performance of the feature selection, it may not have a substantial impact on the MRI radiomics model performance.",Diagnostics,,['JournalArticle'],1944b6e1-2c1d-4f42-88e3-9f8a52f57e47,Diagnostics,,13,Unknown,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,3,28,"Cindy Xue, Jing Yuan, Gladys G.

It leverages the extraordinary data-fitting capacity of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) while preserving high interpretability and robustness by embedding widely applicable physical laws such as the law of mass action and the Arrhenius law. In this paper, we further developed Bayesian CRNN to not only reconstruct but also quantify the uncertainty of chemical kinetic models from data. Two methods, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and variational inference, were used to perform the Bayesian CRNN, with the latter mainly adopted for its speed. We demonstrated the capability of Bayesian CRNN in the kinetic uncertainty quantification of different types of chemical systems and discussed the importance of embedding physical laws in data-driven modeling. Finally, we discussed the adaptation of Bayesian CRNN for incomplete measurements and model mixing for global uncertainty quantification.","Physical Chemistry, Chemical Physics - PCCP",journal,['JournalArticle'],63ed87ae-e104-4cfe-91c9-eb1f2f9ed5b0,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,,,N/A,2023,2023-01-20 00:00:00,17,7,"Qiaofeng Li, Huaibo Chen, Benjamin C.

Despite this, coffee remains vulnerable to several plant diseases that may result in significant financial losses for the agricultural industry. Traditionally, plant diseases are detected by expert observation with the naked eye. Traditional methods for managing such diseases are arduous, time-consuming, and costly, especially when dealing with expansive territories. Using a model based on transfer learning and deep learning model, we present in this study a technique for classifying Robusta coffee leaf disease photos into healthy and unhealthy classes. The MobileNetV2 network serves as the model since its network design is simple. Therefore, it is likely that the suggested approach will be deployed further on mobile devices. In addition, the transfer learning and experimental learning paradigms. Because it is such a lightweight net, the MobileNetV2 system serves as the foundational model. Results on Robusta coffee leaf disease datasets indicate that the suggested technique can achieve a high level of accuracy, up to 99.93%. The accuracy of other architectures besides MobileNetV2 such as DenseNet169 is 99.74%, ResNet50 architecture is 99.41%, and InceptionResNetV2 architecture is 99.09%.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,N/A,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,12,24,"Y.

Food image classification is a challenging problem, the solution of which can be of great benefit to many real-world applications such as nutrition and allergy estimation. Most of the previous studies proposed to use variations of convolutional neural networks to tackle the problem. However, due to the limited number of annotated food image datasets, there is still some room for improvement, especially in terms of accuracy and speed. Generally speaking, neural networks trained to solve image classification problems on a small dataset benefit from utilizing the weights of the networks that have been pre-trained on a large image classification dataset such as ImageNet. In this paper, we compare the trade-offs between training networks from scratch, deploying pre-trained networks as feature extractors, and fine-tuning the networks for Thai food image classification. By utilizing Transfer Learning with EfficientNetV1, we were able to achieve higher accuracy for Thai Food Image Classification on the largest publicly available Thai food image dataset, THFOOD-50. In particular, our proposed method improves upon the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art method from 84.06% to 91.49% while maintaining the speed for the prediction at 103 ms and 1205 ms for GPU and CPU, respectively.",Engineering Journal,journal,,363b13a4-48da-4c84-80db-f138f0e981a0,Engineering Journal,,,N/A,2022,2022-10-31 00:00:00,5,53,"Sirawit Ittisoponpisan, Chayanat Kaipan, Somporn Ruang-on, Rattayagon Thaiphan, Kritaphat Songsri-in","13394408, 2192457036, 2187087969, 51360797, 1412969516",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d97f2bc35be350d8c420bfcb32a6699f85a6d3a8,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science",13394408

To protect birds and the diversity of species on earth, it is urgent to build an automatic bird image recognition system. Therefore, this paper assesses the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning models on image recognition. Also, the help-ability of transfer learning in the field of image recognition is tested to evaluate the best model for bird recognition systems. Three groups of classifiers for bird recognition were constructed, namely, classifiers based on the traditional machine learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning-based convolutional neural networks. After experiments, these three classifiers showed significant differences in the classification effect on the Kaggle-180-birds dataset. The experimental results finally prove that deep learning is more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms in image recognition as the number of bird species increases. Besides, the obtained results show that when the sample data is small, transfer learning can help the deep neural network classifier to improve classification accuracy.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,N/A,2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,16,0,"Mohammed Alswaitti, Liao Zihao, Waleed Alomoush, Ayat Alrosan, Khalid A.

This could be solved through automatic identification and diagnoses using deep learning. However, this technology is not yet explored and examined in the case of peanut leaf spot disease due to some aspects, such as the availability of sufficient data to be used for training and testing the model. This study is intended to explore the use of pre-trained visual geometry group–16 (VGG16), visual geometry group–19 (VGG19), InceptionV3, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 architectures and deep learning optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Momentum, adaptive moment estimation (Adam), root mean square propagation (RMSProp), and adaptive gradient algorithm (Adagrad) in creating a model that can identify leaf spot disease by using a total of 1,000 images of leaves captured using a mobile camera. Confusion matrix was used to assess the accuracy and precision of the results. The result of the study shows that DenseNet-169 trained using SGD with momentum, Adam, and RMSProp attained the highest accuracy of 98%, while DenseNet-169 trained using RMSProp achieved the highest precision of 98% among pre-trained deep convolutional neural network architectures.

Net benefit is an increasingly reported decision analytic measure that puts benefits and harms on the same scale. This is achieved by specifying an exchange rate, a clinical judgment of the relative value of benefits (such as detecting a cancer) and harms (such as unnecessary biopsy) associated with models, markers, and tests. The exchange rate can be derived by asking simple questions, such as the maximum number of patients a doctor would recommend for biopsy to find one cancer. As the answers to these sorts of questions are subjective, it is possible to plot net benefit for a range of reasonable exchange rates in a “decision curve.” For clinical prediction models, the exchange rate is related to the probability threshold to determine whether a patient is classified as being positive or negative for a disease. Net benefit is useful for determining whether basing clinical decisions on a model, marker, or test would do more good than harm. This is in contrast to traditional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are statistical abstractions not directly informative about clinical value. Recent years have seen an increase in practical applications of net benefit analysis to research data. This is a welcome development, since decision analytic techniques are of particular value when the purpose of a model, marker, or test is to help doctors make better clinical decisions.",British medical journal,journal,['JournalArticle'],3048b449-a773-4256-9bb5-5e61fbb61e52,The BMJ,,352,N/A,2016,2016-01-25 00:00:00,748,22,"A.

As the thyroid gland controls human metabolism, thyroid illness is a matter of concern for human health. To save time and reduce error rates, an automatic, reliable, and accurate thyroid identification machine-learning (ML) system is essential. The proposed model aims to address existing work limitations such as the lack of detailed feature analysis, visualization, improvement in prediction accuracy, and reliability. Here, a public thyroid illness dataset containing 29 clinical features from the University of California, Irvine ML repository was used. The clinical features helped us to build an ML model that can predict thyroid illness by analyzing early symptoms and replacing the manual analysis of these attributes. Feature analysis and visualization facilitate an understanding of the role of features in thyroid prediction tasks. In addition, the overfitting problem was eliminated by 5-fold cross-validation and data balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Ensemble learning ensures prediction model reliability owing to the involvement of multiple classifiers in the prediction decisions. The proposed model achieved 99.5% accuracy, 99.39% sensitivity, and 99.59% specificity with the boosting method which is applicable to real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to ease diagnosis and promote early treatment.",Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction,,['JournalArticle'],472fe64a-ea91-4506-8d2d-4c9a9374e1ea,Mach.

Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, 3194 SPECT thyroid images were collected for model training (n=2067), internal validation (n=514) and external validation (n=613). First, four pretrained DCNN models (AlexNet, ShuffleNetV2, MobileNetV3 and ResNet-34) for were tested multiple medical image classification of thyroid disease types (i.e., Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, thyroid tumor and normal thyroid). The best performing model was then subjected to fivefold cross-validation to further assess its performance, and the diagnostic performance of this model was compared with that of junior and senior nuclear medicine physicians. Finally, class-specific attentional regions were visualized with attention heatmaps using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Results Each of the four pretrained neural networks attained an overall accuracy of more than 0.85 for the classification of SPECT thyroid images. The improved ResNet-34 model performed best, with an accuracy of 0.944. For the internal validation set, the ResNet-34 model showed higher accuracy (p < 0.001) when compared to that of the senior nuclear medicine physician, with an improvement of nearly 10%. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.931 for the external dataset, a significantly higher accuracy than that of the senior physician (0.931 vs. 0.868, p < 0.001). Conclusion The DCNN-based model performed well in terms of diagnosing thyroid scintillation images. The DCNN model showed higher sensitivity and greater specificity in identifying Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid tumors compared to those of nuclear medicine physicians, illustrating the feasibility of deep learning models to improve the diagnostic efficiency for assisting clinicians.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,journal,['JournalArticle'],baea33cc-0a71-4b2a-9f01-5071f7b1abc9,Frontiers in Endocrinology,,14,N/A,2023,2023-08-11 00:00:00,14,42,"Huayi Zhao, C.

Traditional physical and chemical analysis methods for green plum acidity detection are destructive, time-consuming, and unable to achieve online detection. In response, a rapid and non-destructive detection method based on hyperspectral imaging technology was studied in this paper. Research on prediction performance comparisons between supervised learning methods and unsupervised learning methods is currently popular. To further improve the accuracy of component prediction, a new hyperspectral imaging system was developed, and the kernel principle component analysis—linear discriminant analysis—extreme gradient boosting algorithm (KPCA-LDA-XGB) model was proposed to predict the acidity of green plum. The KPCA-LDA-XGB model is a supervised learning model combined with the extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental results proved that the KPCA-LDA-XGB model offers good acidity predictions for green plum, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.829 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.107 for the prediction set.

However, for these large amounts of data, many common and cutting‐edge effective bioinformatics research methods still cannot be widely used. This has encouraged the establishment of many analytical platforms, a portion of databases or platforms were designed to solve the special analysis needs of users, for instance, MG RAST, IMG/M, Qiita, BIGSdb, and TRAPR were developed for specific omics research, and some databases or servers provide solutions for special problems solutions. Metascape was designed to only provide functional annotations of genes as well as function enrichment analysis; BioNumerics and RidomSeqSphere+ perform multilocus sequence typing; CARD provides only antimicrobial resistance annotations. Additionally, some web services are outdated, and inefficient interaction often fails to meet the needs of researchers, such as our previous versions of the platform. Therefore, the demand to complete massive data processing tasks urgently requires a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis platform. Hence, we have developed a website platform, Sangerbox 3.0 (http://vip.sangerbox.com/), a web‐based tool platform. On a user‐friendly interface that also supports differential analysis, the platform provides interactive customizable analysis tools, including various kinds of correlation analyses, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted correlation network analysis, and other common tools and functions, users only need to upload their own corresponding data into Sangerbox 3.0, select required parameters, submit, and wait for the results after the task has been completed. We have also established a new interactive plotting system that allows users to adjust the parameters in the image; moreover, optimized plotting performance enables users to adjust large‐capacity vector maps on the web site. At the same time, we have integrated GEO, TCGA, ICGC, and other databases and processed data in batches, greatly reducing the difficulty to obtain data and improving the efficiency of bioimformatics study for users. Finally, we also provide users with rich sources of bioinformatics analysis courses, offering a platform for researchers to share and exchange knowledge.",iMeta,,['JournalArticle'],033b2db2-7ddc-466e-ad41-adbf06e29ef3,iMeta,,1,Unknown,2022,2022-07-08 00:00:00,596,25,"Weitao Shen, Ziguang Song, Xiao Zhong, Mei Huang, Danting Shen, Pingping Gao, Xiaoqian Qian, Mengmeng Wang, Xiubin He, Tonglian Wang, Shuang Li, Xiangyuan Song","2149662145, 1785367067, 2113309268, 2175549323, 52211482, 2147233971, 5743381, 2175581044, 2175540259, 87679026, 2175859828, 2118944636",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fabff697cd0ec343490f89e8e6587200d97f378,"Biology, Computer Science, Medicine",2149662145

Unfortunately, 10%–40% of patients have primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy. TNF family genes play crucial roles in inflammation and immune regulation; however, the effects of TNF family genes on CD remain unclear. Methods CD expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Unsupervised clustering was then used to identify the gene subtypes in CD based on the expressions of TNF family genes. The features of the gene subtypes were characterized using functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses, and biomarkers of the gene subtypes were identified. Results Patients with CD were divided on the basis of unsupervised clustering into two gene subtypes: immune and metabolic. Gene subtype A was significantly correlated with leukocyte migration and cytokine interactions, whereas gene subtype B was associated with metabolic pathways. Whereas 89.5% of the patients in gene subtype B responded to infliximab, only 16.7% of patients in gene subtype A responded. In addition, a combination of interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), interleukin 6 (IL6), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) can effectively distinguish between gene subtypes A and B. Conclusion Comprehensive analyses of the TNF family genes may reveal the underlying pathogenesis of CD. The classification of subtypes may provide new ideas for the personalized treatment of patients with CD.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,13,N/A,2022,2022-04-22 00:00:00,4,34,"Chenglin Ye, Sizhe Zhu, Jingping Yuan","80080655, 2110018754, 2150063854",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03327d34c5a42b422a0ce9596f4ca6c7767f1425,Medicine,80080655

Validation of candidate biomarkers in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced experimental colitis model and ceRNA network in an HCT116 cell line was also an aim, along with purposing to reveal the pathogenesis of CD. Methods GSE102134 and GSE67106 datasets were obtained and used to screen the differentially expressed genes. WCGNA was applied to identify the relative model to construct the ceRNA network. Furthermore, the relationship between candidate gene and immune infiltration was investigated. Then, the expression of potential biomarkers was validated via qRT-PCR in a TNBS induced experimental colitis model. Finally, the ceRNA network was confirmed by RNAi experiments in an HCT116 cell line. Results The ceRNA network, consisting of four lncRNAs, four miRNAs, and eight mRNAs, was constructed and the ROC analysis showed four mRNAs (PTGS2, LPL, STAT1, and TRIB2) had high diagnostic accuracy (AUC>0.9). In addition, upregulated PTGS2 was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including Natural killer cells, exhausted T-cells, monocytes, and Dendritic cells. The outcome of this TNBS induced experimental colitis model verified that the expression of PTGS2 and mir-429 was consistent with results of previous bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the predicted ceRNA network MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 were validated via RNA interference. Knockout of MIR3142HG decreased the mRNA level of PTGS2, whereas inhibition of mir-429 increased the mRNA level of PTGS2 in the HCT116 cell line. Conclusion The exploration of the ceRNA network in this work might contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of CD. The constructed MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 ceRNA network may play a role in CD, and PTGS2 can be a potential immune-related biomarker in CD.",Journal of Inflammation Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],2264e13c-a38e-4a95-ad47-1fd698d3fc68,Journal of Inflammation Research,6447 - 6459,14,N/A,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,7,47,"Chenglin Ye, Sizhe Zhu, Jingping Yuan","80080655, 2110018754, 7998468",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a80c4f36fffb31d3ec222d31aba34a185d35e2d,"Biology, Medicine",80080655

Baseline β7 expression does not impact αE induction or gene expression in T cells. Phospho-SMAD3 is increased in inflamed mucosa in IBD. Targeting interactions between α4β7 integrin and endothelial adhesion molecule MAdCAM-1 to inhibit lymphocyte migration to the gastrointestinal tract is an effective therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Following lymphocyte entry into the mucosa, a subset of these cells expresses αEβ7 integrin, which is expressed on proinflammatory lymphocytes, to increase cell retention. The factors governing lymphocyte migration into the intestinal mucosa and αE integrin expression in healthy subjects and IBD patients remain incompletely understood. We evaluated changes in factors involved in lymphocyte migration and differentiation within tissues. Both ileal and colonic tissue from active IBD patients showed upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1 at the gene and protein levels compared with healthy subjects and/or inactive IBD patients. β1 and β7 integrin expression on circulating lymphocytes was similar across groups. TGF-β1 treatment induced expression of αE on both β7+ and β7− T cells, suggesting that cells entering the mucosa independently of MAdCAM-1/α4β7 can become αEβ7+. ITGAE gene polymorphisms did not alter protein induction following TGF-β1 stimulation. Increased phospho-SMAD3, which is directly downstream of TGF-β, and increased TGF-β–responsive gene expression were observed in the colonic mucosa of IBD patients. Finally, in vitro stimulation experiments showed that baseline β7 expression had little effect on cytokine, chemokine, transcription factor, and effector molecule gene expression in αE+ and αE− T cells. These findings suggest cell migration to the gut mucosa may be altered in IBD and α4β7−, and α4β7+ T cells may upregulate αEβ7 in response to TGF-β once within the gut mucosa.",Journal of Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3456d2d7-a9b4-495f-a7a0-a238096ee07a,The Journal of Immunology Author Choice,2245 - 2254,207,N/A,2021,2021-09-24 00:00:00,36,48,"M.

No study has yet evaluated the effects of applying the water supply adjustment standard (Standard) and activating the reservoir emergency storage in response to extreme drought. The main objective is to assess the effects of applying Standard and activating emergency storage in meeting the water demand under extreme drought at six multipurpose reservoirs (Andong, Gimcheon-Buhang, Gunwi, Hapcheon, Imha, and Milyang) in the Nakdong River Basin, South Korea. We built a reservoir simulation model (HEC-ResSim), determined the extreme drought scenarios, and emergency storage capacity. We evaluated three reservoir operation cases (general operation, regular Standard, and revised Standard) from 2011 to 2100. The results show that applying the Standard and activating the emergency storage are effective in meeting the future water demand during extreme drought. In conclusion, we need to secure 110 million cubic meters (MCM) (Hapcheon reservoir) and 8 MCM (Gunwi reservoir) of water to reduce the number of days in the emergency stage. This research serves as a fundamental study that can help establish Standard and emergency storage activation criteria for other multipurpose reservoirs in preparation for extreme drought.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2022,2022-10-14 00:00:00,5,32,"Heechan Chae, J.

Left unnoticed and untreated, the deterioration in a health condition could even result in mortality. If it can be detected early, with proper treatment, undesirable outcomes can be avoided. Until now, the gold standard is the invasive way of measuring blood pressure (BP) using a catheter. Additionally, the cuff-based and noninvasive methods are too cumbersome or inconvenient for frequent measurement of BP. With the advancement of sensor technology, signal processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms, researchers are trying to find the perfect relationships between biomedical signals and changes in BP. This paper is a literature review of the studies conducted on the cuffless noninvasive measurement of BP using biomedical signals. Relevant articles were selected using specific criteria, then traditional techniques for BP measurement were discussed along with a motivation for cuffless measurement use of biomedical signals and machine learning algorithms. The review focused on the progression of different noninvasive cuffless techniques rather than comparing performance among different studies. The literature survey concluded that the use of deep learning proved to be the most accurate among all the cuffless measurement techniques. On the other side, this accuracy has several disadvantages, such as lack of interpretability, computationally extensive, standard validation protocol, and lack of collaboration with health professionals. Additionally, the continuing work by researchers is progressing with a potential solution for these challenges. Finally, future research directions have been provided to encounter the challenges.",Bioengineering,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",103075b0-1b66-4b69-9c47-f54875634fba,Bioengineering,,10,N/A,2022,2022-12-24 00:00:00,17,236,"M.

However, for conscious individuals, traditional cuff-based BP monitoring devices are often uncomfortable, intermittent, and impractical for frequent measurements. Continuous and non-invasive BP (NIBP) monitoring is currently gaining attention in the human health monitoring area due to its promising potentials in assessing the health status of an individual, enabled by machine learning (ML), for various purposes such as early prediction of disease and intervention treatment. This review presents the development of a non-invasive BP measuring tool called sphygmomanometer in brief, summarizes state-of-the-art NIBP sensors, and identifies extended works on continuous NIBP monitoring using commercial devices. Moreover, the NIBP predictive techniques including pulse arrival time, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, and ML are elaborated on the basis of bio-signals acquisition from these sensors. Additionally, the different BP values (systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure) of the various ML models adopted in several reported studies are compared in terms of the international validation standards developed by the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) for clinically-approved BP monitors. Finally, several challenges and possible solutions for the implementation and realization of continuous NIBP technology are addressed.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,396,2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,27,118,"Siti Nor Ashikin Ismail, Nazrul Anuar, R.

This work demonstrates a new hollow core optical fiber based on a different guiding mechanism, which confines light with a cladding made of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material through total internal reflection. We show that the addition of a layer of ENZ material coating (e.g. indium tin oxide layer) significantly reduces the loss of the waveguide compared to the structure without the ENZ layer. We also show that the propagation loss of the ENZ hollow core fiber can be further improved by integrating ENZ materials with lower loss. This study presents a novel type of hollow core fiber, and can find advanced in-fiber photonic applications such as laser surgery/spectroscopy, novel gas-filled/discharge laser, in-fiber molecular/gas sensing, and low-latency optical fiber communication.",Nanophotonics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1025 - 1031,13,N/A,2024,2024-03-01 00:00:00,2,38,"Leon Zhang, Stuart Love, Aleksei Anopchenko, H.

Up until now, no discussion of phase transitions of nodal lines in photonic crystals using the Euler class has been reported, despite the fact that the Euler class and topological phase transition have recently been addressed in metallic or acoustic crystals. Here, we show how the deformation of a photonic crystal causes topological phase transitions in the nodal lines, and the Euler class can be used to theoretically predict the nodal lines’ stability based on the non-Abelian topological charge theory. Specifically, by manipulating the separation between the two single diamond structures and the extent of structural distortion, we numerically demonstrate the topological transition of nodal lines, e.g., from nodal lines to nodal rings. We then demonstrate that the range of surface states is strongly influenced by the topological phase transition of nodal lines. Moreover, the Zak phase was used to explain the surface states’ existence.",Nanophotonics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1079 - 1089,13,N/A,2024,2024-02-23 00:00:00,1,43,"Haedong Park, Alexander Jones, Minkyung Kim, S.

Despite remarkable progress, dynamically tunable metasurface holography in the visible band has rarely been reported due to limited available tuning methods. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate a thermally tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanofin based binary-phase metasurface, which generates holographic information in the visible varying with temperature. The insulator-to-metal phase transition in VO2 nanofins allows two independent binary-phase holograms generated by machine learning to be encoded in the respective phases of VO2 and switched under thermal regulation. By elaborately designing the dimensions and compensated phase of VO2 nanofins, high-quality images are reconstructed at corresponding temperatures under appropriate chiral illumination. In contrast, much poorer images are produced under inappropriate chiral illumination. We further demonstrate the advantage of applying the VO2 phase-compensated metasurface in high-security digital encryption, where two desired character combinations are read out with appropriate excitations and temperatures, whereas one identical fraudulent message is received with inappropriate excitations.

Experimentally determined aspect ratio, i.e. the ratio between the cavity and nanoparticle size, for hollow structures formed under different irradiation conditions shows a very good agreement with values obtained by means of atomistic simulations. According to the predictions of the atomistic model, one can produce at will hollow silver nanoparticles with cavities of tailored dimensions, having an accurate control. Hence, laser irradiation can be used to control and design the optical response by tuning the localized surface plasmon resonances of the hollow nanoparticles.",Nanophotonics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1149 - 1157,13,N/A,2024,2024-02-16 00:00:00,3,65,"Francisco Sánchez-Pérez, Olivia Borrell-Grueiro, Alfredo Casasnovas-Melián, D.

To explore metamaterials with nanoscale topologies, interest in three-dimensional nanofabrication methods has grown and led to rapid production of target nanostructures over large areas. Additionally, inverse design methods have revolutionized materials science, enabling the optimization of microstructures and topologies to achieve the desired properties without extensive experimental cycles. This review highlights the recent progress in inverse design methods applied in proximity-field nanopatterning. It introduces novel approaches, such as adjoint methods and particle swarm optimization, to achieve target topologies and high-resolution nanostructures. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms for inverse design are explored, demonstrating the potential efficacy of the phase-mask design.

The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes’ demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons. Methods We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy. Results The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p < 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.50). Conclusions These results suggest that cultures of concussion non-disclosure can develop in any population where disclosure is perceived as having undesirable consequences, not just athletic populations. Concussion researchers and practitioners should devote more attention to the perceived cost-benefit structures that create concussion non-disclosure to address this crucial public health issue more effectively.",PLoS ONE,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,14,N/A,2019,2019-05-01 00:00:00,33,55,"C.

A condition assessment framework that utilizes AI and sensor data is an important part of such an autonomous control system. A nuclear power plant has various structures, systems, and components (SSCs) such as piping-equipment that carries coolant to the reactor. Piping systems can degrade over time because of flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion. Any cracks and leakages can cause loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The current industry standards for conducting maintenance of vital SSCs can be time and cost-intensive. AI can play a greater role in the condition assessment and can be extended to recognize concrete degradation (chloride-induced damage and alkali–silica reaction) before cracks develop. This paper reviews developments in condition assessment and AI applications of structural and mechanical systems. The applicability of existing techniques to nuclear systems is somewhat limited because its response requires characterization of high and low-frequency vibration modes, whereas previous studies focus on systems where a single vibration mode can define the degraded state. Data assimilation and storage is another challenging aspect of autonomous control. Advances in AI and data mining world can help to address these challenges.",Energies,journal,['Review'],1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,18,180,"H.

In recent years however, synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SRμCT) has become a tool for extending the imaging of two-dimensional thin sections into three-dimensional imaging of tissue blocks, enabling so-called virtual histology with arbitrary clipping planes, volumetric rendering and automatic segmentation. In this study, we present a thorough characterization of human carotid plaques after endarterectomy of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), investigating several different pathologic structures using both SRμCT and histology. Phase-contrast SRμCT was performed with two different magnifications (voxel sizes 6.5 μm and 0.65 μm, respectively), and histology was performed with multiple different stainings (Alpha-actin, Glycophorin A, von Kossa, Movat, CD68). The 0.65 μm high-resolution SRμCT was performed on selected areas with plaque typical relevant morphology, identified on the 6.5 μm low-resolution SRμCT. The tomography datasets were reconstructed with additional 3D volume rendering and compared to histology. In total, nine different regions with typical pathologic structures were identified and imaged with high-resolution SRμCT. The results show many characteristics typical for advanced atherosclerotic plaques, clinically relevant, namely ruptures with thrombosis, neo-vascularization, inflammatory infiltrates in shoulder regions, lipid rich necrotic cores (LRNC), thin fibrous cap, calcifications, lumen irregularities, and changes in vessel wall structures such as the internal elastic membrane. This method’s non-destructive nature renders details of micro-structures with an excellent visual likeness to histology, with the additional strength of multiplanar and 3D visualization and the possibility of multiple re-scans.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,17,N/A,2022,2022-04-26 00:00:00,4,24,"My Truong, T.

Most beers are produced in modern and technologically advanced breweries that use high quality raw materials, thus resulting in minor differences of physical–chemical properties between various beers (of the same style). However, consumers focus on constant quality and sensory properties of their chosen beer. Sensory evaluation is not an easy task and involves flexible methods for determination of differences and changes between beers. It is commonly used in breweries to provide constant quality of finished products, but also to ensure the quality of different raw materials (water, malt, hops) and to minimize the influence of the production process on final quality of beer.",Beverages,,,8f17045e-30f6-4ca1-ae5f-2b261bef44c2,Beverages,,,Unknown,2022,2022-03-02 00:00:00,7,24,"Kristina Habschied, Vinko Krstanović, K.

A human taste panel was conducted to assess the potential of infant formula milk (Aptamil® 1) to mask the taste of two model WHO priority medicines, zinc sulfate and paracetamol, manufactured as dispersible tablets. Simultaneously, the palatability of powder blends of the tablet platforms was assessed. Twenty healthy adult volunteers performed a swirl-and-spit assessment of placebos and API-containing blends in either a lactose-based or a mannitol-based dispersible tablet platform, reconstituted in 10 mL of either water or Aptamil® 1. Eighteen samples were rated for aversion using a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale, grittiness using a 5-point Likert scale, and “acceptability-as-a-medicine” evaluated as: “Would you find this sample acceptable to swallow as a medicine?” with binary answers of Yes/No. The API-containing formulations were more aversive than the placebos; the paracetamol-containing samples being more aversive than zinc sulfate samples. The platforms themselves were not aversive. Non-gritty samples had four-fold greater odds of being acceptable as a medicine. Aptamil® 1 masked the taste of zinc sulfate in the mannitol-based formulation but did not mask the taste of paracetamol in either platform, suggesting a limited taste-masking ability, which may be API and formulation dependent.",Pharmaceutics,journal,['JournalArticle'],3c77be64-fcd3-444d-a98d-f563ab841a7e,Pharmaceutics,,14,N/A,2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,4,47,"Samuel E.

Since the number of known protein sequences currently increases much faster than the number of known protein structures, and is likely to continue to do so in the foreseeable future, reliable ab initio protein structure prediction, without recourse to templates, would be highly desirable. It is currently not possible to achieve sufficient sampling in unrestrained folding to achieve predictions close to the native structure. Recently, very important progress has been made on the restricted problem of predicting spatial amino acid contacts in proteins from many homologous sequences [2]. While it is not yet clear if these techniques, collectively known as direct coupling analysis (DCA), can be leveraged to systematically predict full protein structures, preliminary results indicate that this may be the case [3,4]. DCA has also been used with success for several related problems, such as predicting structures of protein complexes [4] or alternative protein conformations [5]. 
 
The central ingredient in DCA is to learn generative probabilistic models from a set of homologous protein sequences. These models are chosen from an exponential family with linear and quadratic interactions, commonly referred to as Potts models (see Eq 1) [6]. In the literature, this procedure has been motivated by maximum entropy arguments [7–10]. In this Perspective, I will point out that these arguments are mistaken and that the successes of DCA can have nothing to do with maximum entropy. To the contrary, maximum entropy hides the real nature and questions raised by DCA and is thus an obstacle to progress. In addition, maximum entropy has a long and contested history in statistical physics, the field in which it was first introduced [11,12]. Definite and precise results derived in the last decade and a half have here conclusively falsified maximum entropy. Appeals to maximum entropy are therefore prejudicial to a more general acceptance and adoption of DCA.",PLoS Comput.

Arguably the most significant of these changes is that Pfam is now primarily based on the UniProtKB reference proteomes, with the counts of matched sequences and species reported on the website restricted to this smaller set. Building families on reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the website, whilst still providing access to many important model organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however, still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB sequences can still be retrieved. Some Pfam entries (1.6%) which have no matches to reference proteomes remain; we are working with UniProt to see if sequences from them can be incorporated into reference proteomes. Pfam-B, the automatically-generated supplement to Pfam, has been removed. The current release (Pfam 29.0) includes 16 295 entries and 559 clans.

To extend the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta-predictor (MetaPSICOV) which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence alignments, considers a broad range of other sequence-derived features and, uniquely, a range of metrics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues. Results: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range contacts—around 60% higher than PSICOV, and around 40% better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range hydrogen bonding, MetaPSICOV-HB achieves a precision of 0.69 for the top-L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 for the baseline MetaPSICOV.

Nevertheless, the effects of HLA genes in sepsis have still not been comprehensively understood. Methods: A systematical search was performed in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases from inception to 10 September 2021. Random forest (RF) and modified Lasso penalized regression were conducted to identify hub genes in multi-transcriptome data, thus we constructed a prediction model, namely the HLA classifier. ArrayExpress databases, as external validation, were utilized to evaluate its diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive performance. Immune cell infiltration score was calculated via CIBERSORTx tools and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and ssGSEA were conducted to determine the pathways that are significantly enriched in different subgroups. Next, we systematically correlated the HLA classifier with immunological characteristics from multiple perspectives, such as immune-related cell infiltration, pivotal molecular pathways, and cytokine expression. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate the expression level of HLA genes in clinical samples. Results: A total of nine datasets comprising 1,251 patients were included. Based on RF and modified Lasso penalized regression in multi-transcriptome datasets, five HLA genes (B2M, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2) were identified as hub genes, which were used to construct an HLA classifier. In the discovery cohort, the HLA classifier exhibited superior diagnostic value (AUC = 0.997) and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.716) than clinical characteristics or endotypes. Encouragingly, similar results were observed in the ArrayExpress databases. In the E-MTAB-7581 dataset, the use of hydrocortisone in the HLA high-risk subgroup (OR: 2.84, 95% CI 1.07–7.57, p = 0.037) was associated with increased risk of mortality, but not in the HLA low-risk subgroup. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis by CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA revealed that B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and infiltrating lymphocytes (ILs) were significantly richer in HLA low-risk phenotypes, while Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were more abundant in HLA high-risk phenotypes. The HLA classifier was significantly negatively correlated with B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and ILs, yet was significantly positively correlated with Tregs and MDSCs. Subsequently, molecular pathways analysis uncovered that cytokine-cytokine receptor (CCR) interaction, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and antigen-presenting cell (APC) co-stimulation were significantly enriched in HLA low-risk endotypes, which was significantly negatively correlated with the HLA classifier in multi-transcriptome data. Finally, the expression levels of several cytokines (IL-10, IFNG, TNF) were significantly different between the HLA subgroups, and the ratio of IL-10/TNF was significantly positively correlated with HLA score in multi-transcriptome data. Results of qRT-PCR validated the higher expression level of B2M as well as lower expression level of HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2 in sepsis samples compared to control sample. Conclusion: Based on five HLA genes, a diagnostic and prognostic model, namely the HLA classifier, was established, which is closely correlated with responses to hydrocortisone and immunosuppression status and might facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",Frontiers in Physiology,journal,['JournalArticle'],e28a224b-8ddb-49a6-82d2-17f23c68b30c,Frontiers in Physiology,,13,N/A,2022,2022-05-24 00:00:00,15,29,"Zhen Chen, R.

Coagulation is a key component of innate immunity since it prevents bacterial dissemination and can provoke inflammation. The term immunothrombosis describes the process by which the innate immune response drives aberrant coagulation, which can result in a lethal condition termed disseminated intravascular coagulation, often seen in sepsis. In this review, we describe the recently uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying inflammasome‐ and STING‐driven immunothrombosis induced by bacterial and viral infections, culminating in tissue factor (TF) activation and release. Current anticoagulant therapeutics, while effective, are associated with a life‐threatening bleeding risk, requiring the urgent development of new treatments. Targeting immunothrombosis may provide a safer option. Thus, we highlight preclinical tools which target TF and/or block canonical (NLRP3) or noncanonical (caspase‐11) inflammasome activation as well as STING‐driven TF release and discuss clinically approved drugs which block key immunothrombotic processes and, therefore, may be redeployed as safer anticoagulants.",European Journal of Immunology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",4bd4c659-7597-4156-bae1-ab3e8fba3fe5,European Journal of Immunology,1024 - 1034,52,N/A,2022,2022-05-15 00:00:00,19,139,"Tristram A.

Adolescents have experienced disruption in their daily routines, including changes in health behaviors such as an increased sedentary behavior and increased smartphone usage. The aim of this study was to assess the association of health behaviors with mental health problems in Austrian adolescents during the pandemic. Five cross-sectional surveys (February 2021 to May 2022) were performed during the pandemic assessing physical activity, smartphone usage, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), sleep quality (ISI-7), and stress (PSS-10). In total, N = 7201 adolescents (age: 14–20 years ((MW±SD): 16.63 ± 1.49 years); 70.2% female, 18.8% migration background) participated. A strong increase in mobile phone usage as well as a decrease in physical activity as compared to pre-pandemic data were observed (p < 0.001). Compared to the lowest smartphone user group (<1 h/d), the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for all investigated mental health symptoms increased with increasing smartphone usage up to 3.2–6.8 in high-utilizers (>8 h/d). The aORs for depressive, anxiety, insomnia, and stress symptoms decreased in physically active compared to inactive adolescents. Results highlight the need for measures to promote responsible smartphone usage as well as to increase physical activity, so as to promote mental health in adolescence.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,19,N/A,2022,2022-07-25 00:00:00,14,22,"E.

The Relationship Between Conspiracy Thinking and the Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Adult Poles,"The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic, tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms among the surveyed Poles. The study was conducted via the Internet in a group of 700 people aged 24.8 ± 6.3 years (mean ± SD). 585 females and 110 males were involved. Scales such as Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the original questionnaire COVID-19 Conspiratorial Beliefs Scale (COVID-19 CBS) designed to measure the tendency to believe in false information about COVID-19 pandemic were used. A positive correlation was observed between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 CBS) and the tendency to believe in general conspiracy theories (GCBS) (r = 0.768; p < 0.001). Moreover, both COVID-19 CBS and GCBS positively correlated with the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study group. For COVID-19 CBS, the correlation coefficients were 0.087 (p < 0.021) and.108 (p < 0.004) for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, while for GCBS the coefficients were 0.132 (p < 0.001) and 0.147 (p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the increased tendency to believe in false beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in the severity of anxiety (b = 0.04; p = 0.021) and depression (b = 0.06; p < 0.001) symptoms. It can be hypothesized that the tendency to believe in false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is positively associated with the tendency to general belief in conspiracy theories.

01bf75c26b238aea72231f9224f6dbff450c0e7e,10.1613/jair.816,An Analysis of Reduced Error Pruning,"Top-down induction of decision trees has been observed to suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase. In particular, it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows linearly with the sample size, even though the accuracy of the tree does not improve. Reduced Error Pruning is an algorithm that has been used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems of decision tree learning. 
 
In this paper we present analyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three different settings. First we study the basic algorithmic properties of the method, properties that hold independent of the input decision tree and pruning examples. Then we examine a situation that intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be replaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute values of the pruning examples are independent of each other. This analysis is conducted under two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis we assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This assumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do not receive any pruning examples. 
 
This paper clarifies the different variants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its algorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis.",Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],aef12dca-60a0-4ca3-819b-cad26d309d4e,J.

The traditional approach of leveraging physical measurements for detecting cyber-induced physical contingencies is insufficient to reflect the accurate cyber-physical states. Moreover, deploying conventional rule-based and anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for cyberattack detection results in higher false positives. Hence, independent usage of detection tools of cyberattacks in cyber and physical sides has a limited capability. In this work, a mechanism to fuse real-time data from cyber and physical domains, to improve situational awareness of the whole system is developed. It is demonstrated how improved situational awareness can help reduce false positives in intrusion detection. This cyber and physical data fusion results in cyber-physical state space explosion which is addressed using different feature transformation and selection techniques. Our fusion engine is further integrated into a cyber-physical power system testbed as an application that collects cyber and power system telemetry from multiple sensors emulating real-world data sources found in a utility. These are synthesized into features for algorithms to detect cyber intrusions. Results are presented using the proposed data fusion application to infer False Data and Command Injection (FDI and FCI)-based Man-in-The-Middle attacks. Post collection, the data fusion application uses time-synchronized merge and extracts features. This is followed by pre-processing such as imputation, categorical encoding, and feature reduction, before training supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning models to evaluate the performance of the intrusion detection system. A major finding is the improvement of detection accuracy by fusion of features from cyber, security, and physical domains. Additionally, it is observed that the semi-supervised co-training technique performs at par with supervised learning methods with the proposed feature vector. The approach and toolset, as well as the dataset that is generated can be utilized to prevent threats such as false data or command injection attacks from being carried out by identifying cyber intrusions accurately.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,119118-119138,9,N/A,2021,2021-01-18 00:00:00,61,105,"Abhijeet Sahu, Zeyu Mao, Patrick Wlazlo, Hao Huang, K.

Contrary to what might be expected, the models derived from the CheqSol experimental data are not more accurate than those derived from the ""noisy"" literature data.

We make predictions of solution free energy using physics-based theory alone and using machine learning/quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) models. We also develop machine learning models where the theoretical energies and cheminformatics descriptors are used as combined input. These models are used to predict solvation free energy. While direct theoretical calculation does not give accurate results in this approach, machine learning is able to give predictions with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼1.1 log S units in a 10-fold cross-validation for our Drug-Like-Solubility-100 (DLS-100) dataset of 100 druglike molecules. We find that a model built using energy terms from our theoretical methodology as descriptors is marginally less predictive than one built on Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) descriptors. Combining both sets of descriptors allows a further but very modest improvement in the predictions. However, in some cases, this is a statistically significant enhancement. These results suggest that there is little complementarity between the chemical information provided by these two sets of descriptors, despite their different sources and methods of calculation.

It is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, stroke, and premature death. Clinical diagnostic criteria comprise an increased P wave duration and biphasic P waves in lead II, III and aVF due to retrograde activation of the left atrium. Machine learning algorithms could improve the diagnosis but require a large-scale, well-controlled and balanced dataset. In silico electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, optimally obtained from a statistical shape model to cover anatomical variability, carry the potential to produce an extensive database meeting the requirements for successful machine learning application. We generated the first in silico dataset including interatrial conduction block of 9,800 simulated ECG signals based on a bi-atrial statistical shape model. Automated feature analysis was performed to evaluate P wave morphology, duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1. Increased P wave duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1 were found for models with interatrial conduction block compared to healthy models. A wide variability of P wave morphology was detected for models with interatrial conduction block. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results suggest that a biphasic P wave morphology seems to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of interatrial conduction block.

However, the process of building personalized computational models can be challenging and requires a high level of human interaction. A pipeline to standardize the generation of a patient's atrial digital twin from clinical data is therefore desirable. We propose a patient-specific Augmented Atria generation pipeline (AugmentA) as a highly automated framework which, starting from clinical geometrical data, provides ready-to-use atrial personalized computational models. AugmentA consists firstly of a pre-processing step applied to the input geometry. Secondly, the atrial orifices are identified and labelled using only one reference point per atrium. If the user chooses to fit a statistical shape model (SSM) to the input geometry, it is first rigidly aligned with the given mean shape before a non-rigid fitting procedure is applied. AugmentA automatically generates the fiber orientation and finds local conduction velocities by minimizing the error between the simulated and clinical local activation time (LAT) map. The pipeline was tested on a cohort of 29 patients on both segmented magnetic resonance images (MRI) and electroanatomical maps of the left atrium. Moreover, the pipeline was applied to a bi-atrial volumetric mesh derived from MRI. The pipeline robustly integrated fiber orientation and anatomical region annotations in 38.4+-5.7 s. The error between in-silico and clinical LAT maps was on average 12.7 ms. In conclusion, AugmentA offers an automated and comprehensive pipeline delivering atrial digital twins from clinical data in procedural time.",medRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],d5e5b5e7-54b1-4f53-82fc-4853f3e71c58,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society,"

Intra-cardiac electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation are often performed without detailed prior knowledge of the mechanism perpetuating AFlut, likely prolonging the procedure time of these invasive interventions. We sought to discriminate the AFlut location [cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent (CTI), peri-mitral, and other left atrium (LA) AFlut classes] with a machine learning-based algorithm using only the non-invasive signals from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Methods and results Hybrid 12-lead ECG dataset of 1769 signals was used (1424 in silico ECGs, and 345 clinical ECGs from 115 patients—three different ECG segments over time were extracted from each patient corresponding to single AFlut cycles). Seventy-seven features were extracted. A decision tree classifier with a hold-out classification approach was trained, validated, and tested on the dataset randomly split after selecting the most informative features. The clinical test set comprised 38 patients (114 clinical ECGs). The classifier yielded 76.3% accuracy on the clinical test set with a sensitivity of 89.7%, 75.0%, and 64.1% and a positive predictive value of 71.4%, 75.0%, and 86.2% for CTI, peri-mitral, and other LA class, respectively. Considering majority vote of the three segments taken from each patient, the CTI class was correctly classified at 92%.

Although a 3D patient-specific model (PSM) can be obtained from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the fiber orientation of cardiac muscle, which significantly affects the electrophysiological and mechanical characteristics of the heart, can hardly be obtained in vivo. Several approaches have been suggested to solve this problem. However, most of them require a considerable amount of human interaction, which is both time-consuming and a potential source of error. In this work, a highly automated pipeline based on a Laplace- Dirichlet-rule-based method (LDRBM) for annotating fibers and anatomical regions in both atria is introduced.

Methods We retrospectively collected electronic medical records of enrolled patients from the data warehouse of China Medical University Hospital, a tertiary medical center in central Taiwan, from January 2012 to November 2018. We included patients who underwent a documented carotid ultrasound within 30 days of experiencing an acute first stroke during the study period. We classified these participants into two groups: those with non-recurrent stroke (those who has not been diagnosed with acute stroke again during the study period) and those with recurrent stoke (those who has been diagnosed with acute stroke during the study period). A total of 1,235 carotid sonographic parameters were analyzed. Data on the patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities were also collected. Python 3.7 was used as the programming language, and the scikit-learn toolkit was used to complete the derivation and verification of the machine learning methods. Results In total, 2,411 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 1,896 and 515 had non-recurrent and recurrent stroke, respectively. After extraction, 43 features of carotid sonography (36 carotid sonographic parameters and seven transcranial color Doppler sonographic parameter) were analyzed. For predicting recurrent stroke, CatBoost achieved the highest area under the curve (0.844, CIs 95% 0.824–0.868), followed by the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (0.832, CIs 95% 0.813–0.851), random forest (0.819, CIs 95% 0.802–0.846), support-vector machine (0.759, CIs 95% 0.739–0.781), logistic regression (0.781, CIs 95% 0.764–0.800), and decision tree (0.735, CIs 95% 0.717–0.755) models. Conclusion When using the CatBoost model, the top three features for predicting recurrent stroke were determined to be the use of anticoagulation medications, the use of NSAID medications, and the resistive index of the left subclavian artery. The CatBoost model demonstrated efficiency and achieved optimal performance in the predictive classification of non-recurrent and recurrent stroke.",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],3bc0e661-dc2a-454a-9ff5-6515430ce9ff,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,,9,N/A,2022,2022-01-28 00:00:00,11,83,"Shih-Yi Lin, Kin-Man Law, Y.

We wished to validate this effect and explore potential mechanisms of action. Methods In a multicentre inception cohort of eRA patients (n=191), we examined the whole blood IGS (MxA, IFI44L, OAS1, IFI6, ISG15) with reference to circulating IFN proteins, clinical outcomes and epigenetic influences on circulating CD19+ B and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Results We reproduced our previous findings demonstrating a raised baseline IGS. We additionally showed, for the first time, that the IGS in eRA reflects circulating IFN-α protein. Paired longitudinal analysis demonstrated a significant reduction between baseline and 6-month IGS and IFN-α levels (p<0.0001 for both). Despite this fall, a raised baseline IGS predicted worse 6-month clinical outcomes such as increased disease activity score (DAS-28, p=0.025) and lower likelihood of a good EULAR clinical response (p=0.034), which was independent of other conventional predictors of disease activity and clinical response. Molecular analysis of CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells demonstrated differentially methylated CPG sites and dysregulated expression of disease relevant genes, including PARP9, STAT1, and EPSTI1, associated with baseline IGS/IFNα levels. Differentially methylated CPG sites implicated altered transcription factor binding in B cells (GATA3, ETSI, NFATC2, EZH2) and T cells (p300, HIF1α). Conclusions Our data suggest that, in eRA, IFN-α can cause a sustained, epigenetically mediated, pathogenic increase in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and that the IGS is, therefore, a robust prognostic biomarker. Its persistent harmful effects provide a rationale for the initial therapeutic targeting of IFN-α in selected patients with eRA.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,journal,['JournalArticle'],2457f111-719e-405a-8b99-3e2ad59ad1e3,Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,1214 - 1223,81,N/A,2022,2022-06-09 00:00:00,27,50,"Faye A H Cooles, J.

Monocytes (MOs) and macrophages, largely associated with arthritis, are contributors and sensors of inflammation through epigenetic modifications. In this study, we investigated associations between clinical features and DNA methylation in blood and synovial fluid (SF) MOs in a prospective cohort of patients with early inflammatory arthritis. DNA methylation profiles of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) blood MOs exhibited marked alterations in comparison with those from healthy donors. We identified additional differences both in blood and SF MOs after comparing patients with UA grouped by their future outcomes, i.e., good versus poor. Patient profiles in subsequent visits revealed a reversion toward a healthy level in both groups, those requiring disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and those who remitted spontaneously. Changes in disease activity between visits also affected DNA methylation, which was partially concomitant in the SF of UA and in blood MOs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Epigenetic similarities between arthritis types allow a common prediction of disease activity.

This potential is encapsulated by the concept of a quantum advantage, which is contingent on a reduction in the consumption of a computational resource, such as time, space or data. Here, we distill the concept of a quantum advantage into a simple framework to aid researchers in biology and medicine pursuing the development of quantum applications. We then apply this framework to a wide variety of computational problems relevant to these domains in an effort to (i) assess the potential of practical advantages in specific application areas and (ii) identify gaps that may be addressed with novel quantum approaches. In doing so, we provide an extensive survey of the intersection of biology and medicine with the current landscape of quantum algorithms and their potential advantages. While we endeavour to identify specific computational problems that may admit practical advantages throughout this work, the rapid pace of change in the fields of quantum computing, classical algorithms and biological research implies that this intersection will remain highly dynamic for the foreseeable future.",Journal of the Royal Society Interface,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",f6537e0e-c3a9-4de5-bd36-19eda0434065,Journal of the Royal Society Interface,,19,N/A,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,48,466,"Benjamin A.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) protect networks by using patterns to detect malicious traffic. As attackers have tried to dissimulate traffic in order to evade the rules applied, several machine learning-based IDSs have been developed. In this study, we focused on one such model involving several algorithms and used the NSL-KDD dataset as a benchmark to train and evaluate its performance. We demonstrate a way to create adversarial instances of network traffic that can be used to evade detection by a machine learning-based IDS. Moreover, this traffic can be used for training in order to improve performance in the case of new attacks. Thus, a generative adversarial network (GAN)—i.e., an architecture based on a deep-learning algorithm capable of creating generative models—was implemented. Furthermore, we tested the IDS performance using the generated adversarial traffic. The results showed that, even in the case of the GAN-generated traffic (which could successfully evade IDS detection), by using the adversarial traffic in the testing process, we could improve the machine learning-based IDS performance.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,396,2023,2023-01-24 00:00:00,13,24,"Andrei-Grigore Mari, Daniel Zinca, V.

In this paper, we propose an MCTS-T algorithm for generating adversarial examples of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The MCTS algorithm enables the generation model to provide a reward value that reflects the probability of generative examples bypassing the detector. To guarantee the antagonism and feasibility of the generative adversarial examples, the bypassing rules are restricted. The experimental results indicate that the missed detection rate of adversarial examples is significantly improved after the MCTS-T generation algorithm. Additionally, we construct a generative adversarial network (GAN) to optimize the detector and improve the detection rate when dealing with adversarial examples. After several epochs of adversarial training, the accuracy of detecting adversarial examples is significantly improved.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,10989-10996,8,N/A,2020,2020-01-09 00:00:00,38,18,"Xueqin Zhang, Yue Zhou, Songwen Pei, J.

This brings cutting-edge computing paradigms with embedded cognitive capabilities into vehicle domains and data infrastructure to provide holistic intrinsic and extrinsic intelligence for new mobility applications. Digital technologies are a significant enabler in achieving the sustainability goals of the green transformation of the mobility and transportation sectors. Innovation occurs predominantly in ECAS vehicles’ architecture, operations, intelligent functions, and automotive digital infrastructure. The traditional ownership model is moving toward multimodal and shared mobility services. The ECAS vehicle’s technology allows for the development of virtual automotive functions that run on shared hardware platforms with data unlocking value, and for introducing new, shared computing-based automotive features. Facilitating vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is accomplished by the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), cellular/wireless connectivity, edge computing, the Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of intelligent things (IoIT), digital twins (DTs), virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Vehicles become more intelligent, connected, functioning as edge micro servers on wheels, powered by sensors/actuators, hardware (HW), software (SW) and smart virtual functions that are integrated into the digital infrastructure. Electrification, automation, connectivity, digitalization, decarbonization, decentralization, and standardization are the main drivers that unlock intelligent vehicles' potential for sustainable green mobility applications. ECAS vehicles act as autonomous agents using swarm intelligence to communicate and exchange information, either directly or indirectly, with each other and the infrastructure, accessing independent services such as energy, high-definition maps, routes, infrastructure information, traffic lights, tolls, parking (micropayments), and finding emergent/intelligent solutions. The article gives an overview of the advances in AI technologies and applications to realize intelligent functions and optimize vehicle performance, control, and decision-making for future ECAS vehicles to support the acceleration of deployment in various mobility scenarios. ECAS vehicles, systems, sub-systems, and components are subjected to stringent regulatory frameworks, which set rigorous requirements for autonomous vehicles. An in-depth assessment of existing standards, regulations, and laws, including a thorough gap analysis, is required. Global guidelines must be provided on how to fulfill the requirements. ECAS vehicle technology trustworthiness, including AI-based HW/SW and algorithms, is necessary for developing ECAS systems across the entire automotive ecosystem. The safety and transparency of AI-based technology and the explainability of the purpose, use, benefits, and limitations of AI systems are critical for fulfilling trustworthiness requirements. The article presents ECAS vehicles’ evolution toward domain controller, zonal vehicle, and federated vehicle/edge/cloud-centric based on distributed intelligence in the vehicle and infrastructure level architectures and the role of AI techniques and methods to implement the different autonomous driving and optimization functions for sustainable green mobility.",Frontiers in Future Transportation,,['Review'],ca3b2ebd-4950-432d-868c-c159aba7bf9c,,,2,Unknown,2021,2021-08-26 00:00:00,38,121,"O.

The goal of this research work is to develop a system that can effectively detect fall/collapse and classify other discrete daily living activities such as sitting, standing, walking, drinking, and bending. For this paper, a publicly accessible dataset is employed, which is captured at various geographical locations using a 5.8 GHz Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) RADAR. A total of ninety-nine participants, including young and elderly individuals, took part in the experimental campaign. During data acquisition, each aforementioned activity was recorded for 5–10 s. Through the obtained data, we generated the micro-doppler signatures using short-time Fourier transform by exploiting MATLAB tools. Subsequently, the micro-doppler signatures are validated, trained, and tested using a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm called Residual Neural Network or ResNet. The ResNet classifier is developed in Python, which is utilised to classify six distinct human activities in this study. Furthermore, the metrics used to analyse the trained model’s performance are precision, recall, F1-score, classification accuracy, and confusion matrix. To test the resilience of the proposed method, two separate experiments are carried out. The trained ResNet models are put to the test by subject-independent scenarios and unseen data of the above-mentioned human activities at diverse geographical spaces. The experimental results showed that ResNet detected the falling and rest of the daily living human activities with decent accuracy.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2021,2021-09-12 00:00:00,32,59,"Umer Saeed, Syed Yaseen Shah, Syed Aziz Shah, Jawad Ahmad, A.

This health status is determined by the apparent decline of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs). Detecting ADLs provides possibilities of improving the home life of elderly people as it can be applied to fall detection systems. This paper presents fall detection in elderly people based on radar image classification by examining their daily routine activities, using radar data that were previously collected for 99 volunteers. Machine learning techniques are used classify six human activities, namely walking, sitting, standing, picking up objects, drinking water and fall events. Different machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, long short-term memory, bi-directional long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks, were used for data classification. To obtain optimum results, we applied data processing techniques, such as principal component analysis and data augmentation, to the available radar images. The aim of this paper is to improve upon the results achieved using a publicly available dataset to further improve upon research of fall detection systems. It was found out that the best results were obtained using the CNN algorithm with principal component analysis and data augmentation together to obtain a result of 95.30% accuracy. The results also demonstrated that principal component analysis was most beneficial when the training data were expanded by augmentation of the available data.

In real environments, activities and movements are performed with seamless motion, with continuous transitions between activities of different duration and a large range of dynamic motions, compared with discrete activities of fixed-time lengths which are typically analysed in the literature. This paper proposes a novel approach based on recurrent LSTM and Bi-LSTM network architectures for continuous activity monitoring and classification. This approach uses radar data in the form of a continuous temporal sequence of micro-Doppler or range-time information, differently from from other conventional approaches based on convolutional networks that interpret the radar data as images. Experimental radar data involving 15 participants and different sequences of 6 actions are used to validate the proposed approach. It is demonstrated that using the Doppler-domain data together with the Bi-LSTM network and an optimal learning rate can achieve over 90% mean accuracy, whereas range-domain data only achieved approximately 76%.

As such, fall detection is a crucial topic. However, due to the trade-off relationship between privacy preservation, user convenience, and fall detection performance, it is generally difficult to develop a fall detection system that simultaneously satisfies all conditions. The main goal of this study is to build a practical fall detection framework that can effectively classify the various behavior types into “Fall” and “Activities of daily living (ADL)” while securing privacy preservation and user convenience. For this purpose, signal data containing the motion information of objects was collected using a non-contact, unobtrusive, and non-restraint impulse-radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) radar. These data were then applied to a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to create an object behavior type classifier that can classify the behavior types of objects into “Fall” and “ADL.” The data were collected by actually performing various activities of daily living, including falling. The performance of the classifier yielded satisfactory results. By combining an IR-UWB and CNN algorithm, this study demonstrates the feasibility of building a practical fall detection system that exceeds a certain level of detection accuracy while also ensuring privacy preservation and user convenience.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,20,396,2020,2020-10-01 00:00:00,31,56,"Taekjin Han, Wonho Kang, Gyunghyun Choi","51065789, 2003575050, 2057605593",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a9a0b22f131c996dc9cf1e24046d79a8f9d9ba,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",51065789

In particular, we find a deep neural network turns out to perform well in characterizing the neutralino jet substructure. We first construct a convolutional neutral network (CNN) which is capable of tagging the neutralino jet in any signal process by using the idea of jet image. When applied to pure jet samples, such a CNN outperforms the N-subjettiness variable by a factor of a few in tagging efficiency. Moreover, we find the method, which combines the CNN output and jet invariant mass, can perform better and is applicable to a wider range of neutralino mass than the CNN alone. Finally, the ATLAS search for the signal of gluino pair production with subsequent decay g˜→qqχ˜10(→qqq) is recast as an application. In contrast to the pure sample, the heavy contamination among jets in this complex final state renders the discriminating powers of the CNN and N subjettiness similar. By analyzing the jets substructure in events which pass the ATLAS cuts with our CNN method, the exclusion limit on gluino mass can be pushed up by ∼200  GeV for neutralino mass ∼100  GeV.",Physical Review D,Unknown,,Unknown,Physical Review D,,,Unknown,2018,2018-05-27 00:00:00,19,63,"Jun Guo, Jinmian Li, Tianjun Li, Fang-Zhou Xu, Wenxing Zhang","2217372496, 2115977488, 8036855, 11047093, 2108143908",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da88d9a10a39305902356c0be707bd963b293df2,Physics,2217372496

This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent research into novel methods for cyber threat detection, encompassing diverse approaches such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, behavioral analysis and anomaly detection. Machine learning plays a central role in cyber threat detection, highlighting the effectiveness of deep neural networks in identifying evolving threats. Their adaptability to changing attack patterns is emphasized, underlining their importance for real-time security monitoring. In parallel, ensemble learning is explored, combining multiple models to improve overall detection accuracy and create a robust defense against a spectrum of cyber threats. The literature reviewed highlights the importance of behavioral analysis, with a novel approach that integrates user behaviour profiling with anomaly detection. This has proven effective in identifying suspicious activity within a network, particularly insider threats and stealthy attacks. Another behavioral framework using User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is presented for enhanced anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of context-aware monitoring in improving threat detection accuracy. Collaborative defense mechanisms emerge as a major focus of the research papers reviewed, exploring the potential of sharing threat information between organisations to enhance collective security monitoring. Their findings underscore the importance of a collaborative approach to staying ahead of rapidly evolving cyber threats. Some types of cyber-attacks are also analysed in the context of a security operations centre (SOC) monitoring environment using a security information and event management (SIEM) tool - Splunk. In conclusion, this survey paper synthesizes recent advances in cyber threat detection methods in security monitoring that integrate machine learning, behavioral analysis, and collaborative defense strategies.

We design a hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to facilitate the automated extraction of spatiotemporal features from raw traffic data. The integration of contrastive learning amplifies the distinction between benign and malicious network traffic in the representation space.

XAI has emerged as a pivotal focus in achieving a zero-trust cybersecurity strategy within marine communication networks. This article presents the development of a zero-trust NIDS framework designed to detect contemporary marine cyberattacks, utilizing two modern datasets (2023 Edge-IIoTset and 2023 CICIoT). The zero-trust NIDS model achieves an optimal Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of 97.33% and an F1-score of 99% in a multi-class experiment. The XAI approach leverages visual and quantitative XAI methods, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithms, to enhance explainability and interpretability. The research results indicate that current black-box NIDS models deployed for marine cyberdefense can be made more reliable and interpretable, thereby improving the overall cybersecurity posture of marine organizations.",Electronics,journal,['JournalArticle'],ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2024,2024-01-08 00:00:00,8,53,"Ebuka Chinaechetam Nkoro, J.

8fbf387974cef504a7ecb37c6ac10046346db4a2,10.3390/app132413310,Evaluating Ensemble Learning Mechanisms for Predicting Advanced Cyber Attacks,"With the increased sophistication of cyber-attacks, there is a greater demand for effective network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to protect against various threats. Traditional NIDS are incapable of detecting modern and sophisticated attacks due to the fact that they rely on pattern-matching models or simple activity analysis. Moreover, Intelligent NIDS based on Machine Learning (ML) models are still in the early stages and often exhibit low accuracy and high false positives, making them ineffective in detecting emerging cyber-attacks. On the other hand, improved detection and prediction frameworks provided by ensemble algorithms have demonstrated impressive outcomes in specific applications. In this research, we investigate the potential of ensemble models in the enhancement of NIDS functionalities in order to provide a reliable and intelligent security defense. We present a NIDS hybrid model that uses ensemble ML techniques to identify and prevent various intrusions more successfully than stand-alone approaches. A combination of several distinct machine learning methods is integrated into a hybrid framework. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is pre-processed, and its features are engineered prior to being used to train and evaluate the proposed model structure. The performance evaluation of the ensemble of various ML classifiers demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms individual model approaches. Using all the employed experimental combination forms, the designed model significantly enhances the detection accuracy attaining more than 99%, while false positives are reduced to less than 1%.",Applied Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-12-16 00:00:00,4,26,"F.

This approach assumes homogeneous groups in terms of profiles and response to external effectors. These assumptions are not always fulfilled, especially in complex natural systems, like the microbiome of the human gut. It is actually established that humans with otherwise the same demographic or dietary backgrounds can have distinct microbial profiles. We suggest an alternative approach to the analysis of microbial time-series, based on the following premises: 1) microbial communities are organized in distinct clusters of similar composition at any time point, 2) these intrinsic subsets of communities could have different responses to the same external effects, and 3) the fate of the communities is largely deterministic given the same external conditions. Therefore, tracking the transition of communities, rather than individual taxa, across these states, can enhance our understanding of the ecological processes and allow the prediction of future states, by incorporating applied effects. We implement these ideas into Cronos, an analytical pipeline written in R. Cronos’ inputs are a microbial composition table (e.g., OTU table), their phylogenetic relations as a tree, and the associated metadata. Cronos detects the intrinsic microbial profile clusters on all time points, describes them in terms of composition, and records the transitions between them. Cluster assignments, combined with the provided metadata, are used to model the transitions and predict samples’ fate under various effects. We applied Cronos to available data from growing infants’ gut microbiomes, and we observe two distinct trajectories corresponding to breastfed and formula-fed infants that eventually converge to profiles resembling those of mature individuals.

This is due in part to the fact that there are no labels or gold standards by which performance can be measured. Moreover, the wide range of clustering methods available is governed by different objective functions, different parameters, and dissimilarity measures. The purpose of clustering is versatile, often playing critical roles in the early stages of exploratory data analysis and as an endpoint for knowledge and discovery. Thus, understanding the quality of a clustering is of critical importance. The concept of stability has emerged as a strategy for assessing the performance and reproducibility of data clustering. The key idea is to produce perturbed data sets that are very close to the original, and cluster them. If the clustering is stable, then the clusters from the original data will be preserved in the perturbed data clustering. The nature of the perturbation, and the methods for quantifying similarity between clusterings, are nontrivial, and ultimately what distinguishes many of the stability estimation methods apart. In this review, we provide an overview of the very active research area of cluster stability estimation and discuss some of the open questions and challenges that remain in the field.",Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics,Unknown,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",Unknown,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews.

Based on the data from Chinese listed companies between 2010 and 2019, we document that the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) model makes better predictions of corporate risk-taking. We further visualize the importance and influence of the firm basic characteristics, firm performance, and chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics and discover that in the AdaBoost model, the firm basic characteristics, and performance factors, such as the firm’s fixed asset investments, size, and return on equity, are important in predicting corporate risk-taking, while CEO characteristics are less important. Finally, the role of variables in corporate risk-taking varies among large and small enterprises.

The effectiveness of a wearable FDS must be contrasted against a wide variety of measurements obtained from inertial sensors during the occurrence of falls and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). In this regard, the access to public databases constitutes the basis for an open and systematic assessment of fall detection techniques. This paper reviews and appraises twelve existing available data repositories containing measurements of ADLs and emulated falls envisaged for the evaluation of fall detection algorithms in wearable FDSs. The analysis of the found datasets is performed in a comprehensive way, taking into account the multiple factors involved in the definition of the testbeds deployed for the generation of the mobility samples. The study of the traces brings to light the lack of a common experimental benchmarking procedure and, consequently, the large heterogeneity of the datasets from a number of perspectives (length and number of samples, typology of the emulated falls and ADLs, characteristics of the test subjects, features and positions of the sensors, etc.). Concerning this, the statistical analysis of the samples reveals the impact of the sensor range on the reliability of the traces. In addition, the study evidences the importance of the selection of the ADLs and the need of categorizing the ADLs depending on the intensity of the movements in order to evaluate the capability of a certain detection algorithm to discriminate falls from ADLs.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,396,2017,2017-06-27 00:00:00,116,55,"E.

However, sepsis-associated ICU-acquired infections have not been fully characterized. The study aims to assess the risk factors and develop a model that predicts the risk of ICU-acquired infections in patients with sepsis. Methods We retrieved data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors that could predict ICU-acquired infection. We also assessed its discrimination and calibration abilities and compared them with classical score systems. Results Of 16,808 included septic patients, 2,871 (17.1%) developed ICU-acquired infection. These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725–0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 95% CI, 0.734–0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models. Conclusions ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic mortality.

Multiple categories of fairness improving methods have been proposed for neural networks, including pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing. Our empirical study however shows that these methods are not always effective (e.g., they may improve fairness by paying the price of huge accuracy drop) or even not helpful (e.g., they may even worsen both fairness and accuracy). In this work, we propose an approach which adaptively chooses the fairness improving method based on causality analysis. That is, we choose the method based on how the neurons and attributes responsible for unfairness are distributed among the input attributes and the hidden neurons. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is effective (i.e., always identify the best fairness improving method) and efficient (i.e., with an average time overhead of 5 minutes).",ESEC/SIGSOFT FSE,Unknown,"['JournalArticle', 'Book']",Unknown,Proceedings of the 30th ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,,,Unknown,2022,2022-09-15 00:00:00,29,51,"Mengdi Zhang, Jun Sun","2162016852, 48480161",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8f4bfaca3ebf42128226182d6f303ae22d244bb,Computer Science,2162016852

The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern of their dependability and reliability. Similar to traditional decision-making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to be repaired. The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security concerns or unjust societal impacts. In this work, we address the problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to construct a neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting the given neural network's parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically, we propose CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a causality-based neural network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault localization to identify the ‘guilty’ neurons and 2) optimizes the parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior. We have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE successfully improves fairness by 61.91 % on average. For backdoor removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over 98% to less than 1 %. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation rate to less than 1 %. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based fault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of the neural networks.",International Conference on Software Engineering,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Book', 'Conference']",a36dc29e-4ea1-4567-b0fe-1c06daf8bee8,2022 IEEE/ACM 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),338-349,,396,2022,2022-04-20 00:00:00,73,70,"Bing-Jie Sun, Jun Sun, Hong Long Pham, Jie Shi","153182156, 2111628876, 2162960923, 2112364113",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cb0bd9f5927403bf29c3b9ccd25a79daac55194,Computer Science,153182156

0dd67335d80194e7ccf6c0ed275622bf60e5edce,10.3390/su14127375,Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Malicious Domains Detection Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),"With the expansion of the internet, a major threat has emerged involving the spread of malicious domains intended by attackers to perform illegal activities aiming to target governments, violating privacy of organizations, and even manipulating everyday users. Therefore, detecting these harmful domains is necessary to combat the growing network attacks. Machine Learning (ML) models have shown significant outcomes towards the detection of malicious domains. However, the “black box” nature of the complex ML models obstructs their wide-ranging acceptance in some of the fields. The emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has successfully incorporated the interpretability and explicability in the complex models. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI model has enabled the interpretability without affecting the performance of the models. This study aimed to propose an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model to detect malicious domains on a recent dataset containing 45,000 samples of malicious and non-malicious domains. In the current study, initially several interpretable ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB), and black box ensemble models, such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), AdaBoost (AB), and Cat Boost (CB) algorithms, were implemented and found that XGB outperformed the other classifiers. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI global surrogate model (Shapley additive explanations) and local surrogate LIME were used to generate the explanation of the XGB prediction. Two sets of experiments were performed; initially the model was executed using a preprocessed dataset and later with selected features using the Sequential Forward Feature selection algorithm. The results demonstrate that ML algorithms were able to distinguish benign and malicious domains with overall accuracy ranging from 0.8479 to 0.9856. The ensemble classifier XGB achieved the highest result, with an AUC and accuracy of 0.9991 and 0.9856, respectively, before the feature selection algorithm, while there was an AUC of 0.999 and accuracy of 0.9818 after the feature selection algorithm. The proposed model outperformed the benchmark study.",Sustainability,journal,,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-16 00:00:00,37,28,"Nida Aslam, Irfan Ullah Khan, Samiha Mirza, Alanoud Alowayed, Fatima M.

8bdb4900b207c7b1f5cfd5dd4752997f9765e738,10.3390/fi13120309,DNS Firewall Based on Machine Learning,"Nowadays there are many DNS firewall solutions to prevent users accessing malicious domains. These can provide real-time protection and block illegitimate communications, contributing to the cybersecurity posture of the organizations. Most of these solutions are based on known malicious domain lists that are being constantly updated. However, in this way, it is only possible to block malicious communications for known malicious domains, leaving out many others that are malicious but have not yet been updated in the blocklists. This work provides a study to implement a DNS firewall solution based on ML and so improve the detection of malicious domain requests on the fly. For this purpose, a dataset with 34 features and 90 k records was created based on real DNS logs. The data were enriched using OSINT sources. Exploratory analysis and data preparation steps were carried out, and the final dataset submitted to different Supervised ML algorithms to accurately and quickly classify if a domain request is malicious or not. The results show that the ML algorithms were able to classify the benign and malicious domains with accuracy rates between 89% and 96%, and with a classification time between 0.01 and 3.37 s. The contributions of this study are twofold. In terms of research, a dataset was made public and the methodology can be used by other researchers. In terms of solution, the work provides the baseline to implement an in band DNS firewall.",Future Internet,journal,['JournalArticle'],c3e5f1c8-9ba7-47e5-acde-53063a69d483,Future Internet,309,13,N/A,2021,2021-11-30 00:00:00,11,45,"Cláudio Marques, Silvestre Malta, J.

Currently, NMTF learns a representation of a dataset through an optimization procedure that typically uses multiplicative update rules. This procedure has had limited success, and its failure cases have not been well understood. We here perform an empirical study involving six large datasets comparing multiplicative update rules with three alternative optimization methods, including alternating least squares, projected gradients, and coordinate descent. We find that methods based on projected gradients and coordinate descent converge up to twenty-four times faster than multiplicative update rules. Furthermore, alternating least squares method can quickly train NMTF models on sparse datasets but often fails on dense datasets. Coordinate descent-based NMTF converges up to sixteen times faster compared to well-established methods.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,14,N/A,2019,2019-06-11 00:00:00,20,46,"Andrej Čopar, B.

The objective of this mixed research is to analyze the impact of the flipped classroom in the teaching-learning process on statistics considering data science and machine learning (linear regression). The sample consists of 61 students who took the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course during the 2018 school year. This research proposes the consultation of the YouTube videos before the class, performance of the collaborative exercises and use of the spreadsheet to check the results during the class and performance of the laboratory practices through the spreadsheet after the class. The results of machine learning (70%, 80% and 90% of training) indicate that the participation of the students before, during and after the class positively influences the assimilation of knowledge and development of mathematical skills about the frequencies and measures of central tendency. On the other hand, the decision tree technique identifies 6 predictive models on the use of the flipped classroom. Also, the students of the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course are motivated and satisfied to use the technological tools in the Introduction to statistics Unit. Finally, the flipped classroom allows the construction of new educational spaces and creation of creative activities before, during and after the class that favor the participation of the students during the learning process.",LUMAT,,,43dbf96c-3d83-48d8-b6a5-1b59351a7580,"LUMAT: International Journal on Math, Science and Technology Education",,,Unknown,2020,2020-10-28 00:00:00,2,28,R.

Machine learning based techniques, in particular deep neural networks, can provide a viable alternative to maximum-likelihood methods. However, most common neural network architectures were developed for other domains such as image recogntion. While these methods can enhance the reconstruction performance in IceCube, there is much potential for tailored techniques. In the typical physics use-case, many symmetries, invariances and prior knowledge exist in the data, which are not fully exploited by current network architectures. Novel and specialized deep learning based reconstruction techniques are desired which can leverage the physics potential of experiments like IceCube.
A reconstruction method using convolutional neural networks is presented which can significantly increase the reconstruction accuracy while greatly reducing the runtime in comparison to standard reconstruction methods in Ice- Cube. In addition, first results are discussed for future developments based on generative neural networks.",EPJ Web of Conferences,journal,['Conference'],f2cc63fa-90cb-413d-92ce-003d5244a1e8,EPJ Web of Conferences,,,N/A,2019,2019-10-01 00:00:00,10,10,Mirco Hünnefeld,8185612,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b5378514457d040b7f8299d3799d25786e190e2,"Computer Science, Physics",8185612

Similar to the 2015 task, the goal of the shared task is to identify individual discourse relations that are present in natural language text. Given a natural language text, participating teams are asked to locate the discourse connectives (explicit or implicit) and their arguments as well as predicting the sense of the discourse connectives. Based on the success of the previous year, we continued to ask participants to deploy their systems on TIRA, a web-based platform on which participants can run their systems on the test data for evaluation. This evaluation methodology preserves the integrity of the shared task. We have also made a few changes and additions in the 2016 shared task based on the feedback from 2015. The first is that teams could choose to carry out the task on Chinese texts, or English texts, or both. We have also allowed participants to focus on parts of the shared task (rather than the whole thing) as a typical system requires substantial investment of effort. Finally, we have modified the scorer so that it can report results based on partial matches of the arguments. 23 teams participated in this year’s shared task, using a wide variety of approaches. In this overview paper, we present the task definition, the training and test sets, and the evaluation protocol and metric used during this shared task. We also summarize the different approaches adopted by the participating teams, and present the evaluation results. The evaluation data sets and the scorer will serve as a benchmark for future research on shallow discourse parsing.",Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3779a5a7-9119-4f69-84fe-f7eef193eb49,,1-19,,396,2016,2016-08-12 00:00:00,134,48,"Nianwen Xue, H.

However, there are important linguistic differences between explicit and implicit discourse relations, which limit the accuracy of such an approach. We account for these differences by applying techniques from domain adaptation, treating implicitly and explicitly-marked discourse relations as separate domains. The distribution of surface features varies across these two domains, so we apply a marginalized denoising autoencoder to induce a dense, domain-general representation. The label distribution is also domain-specific, so we apply a resampling technique that is similar to instance weighting. In combination with a set of automatically-labeled data, these improvements eliminate more than 80% of the transfer loss incurred by training an implicit discourse relation classifier on explicitly-marked discourse relations.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",41bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,,2219-2224,,396,2015,2015-09-01 00:00:00,29,25,"Yangfeng Ji, Gongbo Zhang, Jacob Eisenstein","40608686, 2115982376, 144154709",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b8d7847251fa73e78e0cad9ef78e25490345539,"Computer Science, Linguistics, Mathematics",40608686

In this paper, we propose a Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) for implicit discourse relation recognition, which contains only one hidden layer but is effective in relation recognition. The shallow structure alleviates the overfitting problem, while the convolution and nonlinear operations help preserve the recognition and generalization ability of our model. Experiments on the benchmark data set show that our model achieves comparable and even better performance when comparing against current state-of-the-art systems.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",41bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,,2230-2235,,396,2015,2015-09-01 00:00:00,108,28,"Biao Zhang, Jinsong Su, Deyi Xiong, Yaojie Lu, Hong Duan, Junfeng Yao","48335426, 34739384, 2694222, 1831434, 2053665215, 34122399",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3ff76f8a65086371caf0df09ae545a70a1a0004,Computer Science,48335426

In this study, Fourier transform infrared spectra were collected from 88 endoscopic biopsy colorectal tissue samples (41 colitis and 47 cancers). A new method, viz., entropy weight local-hyperplane k-nearest-neighbor (EWHK), which is an improved version of K-local hyperplane distance nearest-neighbor (HKNN), is proposed for tissue classification. In order to avoid limiting high dimensions and small values of the nearest neighbor, the new EWHK method calculates feature weights based on information entropy. The average results of the random classification showed that the EWHK classifier for differentiating cancer from colitis samples produced a sensitivity of 81.38% and a specificity of 92.69%.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,396,2017,2017-11-27 00:00:00,22,29,"Qingbo Li, Can Hao, Xue Kang, Jialin Zhang, Xuejun Sun, Wenbo Wang, H.

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations.

The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) of the Sentinel-3 satellites program is capable of providing images for the monitoring of such waters. Atmospheric correction is a necessary process in order to retrieve the desired surface-leaving radiance signal and several atmospheric correction methods have been developed through the years. However, many of these correction methods require programming language skills, or function as commercial software plugins, limiting their possibility of use by end users. Accordingly, in this study, the free SNAP software provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to evaluate the possible differences between a partial atmospheric correction method accounting for Rayleigh scattering and a full atmospheric correction method (iCOR), applied on Sentinel-3 OLCI images of a shallow, highly eutrophic water reservoir. For the complete evaluation of the two methods, in addition to the comparison of the band reflectance values, chlorophyll (CHL) and cyanobacteria (CI) indices were also calculated and their values were intercompared. The results showed, that although the absolute values between the two correction methods did not coincide, there was a very good correlation between the two methods for both bands’ reflectance (r > 0.73) and the CHL and CI indices values (r > 0.95). Therefore, since iCOR correction image processing time is 25 times longer than Rayleigh correction, it is proposed that the Rayleigh partial correction method may be alternatively used for seasonal water monitoring, especially in cases of long time-series, enhancing time and resources use efficiency. Further comparisons of the two methods in other inland water bodies and evaluation with in situ chlorophyll and cyanobacteria measurements will enhance the applicability of the methodology.",PeerJ,journal,['JournalArticle'],558a3215-8ffd-4b31-be7f-f653ca3b600d,PeerJ,,10,N/A,2022,2022-11-04 00:00:00,4,54,"Stefanos Katsoulis-Dimitriou, Marios Lefkaditis, Sotirios Barmpagiannakos, K.

Catchment and water management, organisations, industry, farmers and local governments are all confronting the effects of climate change, which stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria and affect the efficacy of adaptation measures in water systems. To tackle climate change and CyanoHABs growth, actors at different levels require both ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ assessments to help them in formulating and implementing adaptation measures. Potential solutions must also be assessed locally to limit associated adverse effects, in particular, negative effects on water quality. Thus, having a better understanding of the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between adaptation practices and climate-change effects on CyanoHABs makes a valuable contribution to a more integrated climate policy and the effective climate-proofing of our water bodies. This article examines adaptation practices focused on tackling CyanoHABs occurrence in a changing climate. It fills an important gap between a major environmental problem and potential solutions. The practices and measures advanced as a result of the analysis can be used by persons with different expertise and skill levels for improving the relevant institutional frameworks and policies to protect their local water bodies.",Marine and Freshwater Research,journal,,685bc85c-a614-4c26-be69-3ba06cb999c9,Marine and Freshwater Research,,,N/A,2021,2021-08-26 00:00:00,8,111,"A.

Cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence, global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. CyanoHABs are regulated by synergistic effects of nutrient (nitrogen:N and phosphorus:P) supplies, light, temperature, vertical stratification, water residence times, and biotic interactions. In most instances, nutrient control strategies should focus on reducing both N and P inputs. Strategies based on physical, chemical (nutrient) and biological manipulations can be effective in reducing CyanoHABs; however, these strategies are largely confined to relatively small systems, and some are prone to ecological and environmental drawbacks, including enhancing release of cyanotoxins, disruption of planktonic and benthic communities and fisheries habitat. All strategies should consider and be adaptive to climatic variability and change in order to be effective for long-term control of CyanoHABs. Rising temperatures and greater hydrologic variability will increase growth rates and alter critical nutrient thresholds for CyanoHAB development; thus, nutrient reductions for bloom control may need to be more aggressively pursued in response to climatic changes globally.",Life,Unknown,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",Unknown,Life,988 - 1012,4,Unknown,2014,2014-12-01 00:00:00,251,120,H.

Recently, as deep learning models have become more common, RNNs have been used to forecast increasingly complicated systems. Dynamical spatio-temporal processes represent a class of complex systems that can potentially benefit from these types of models. Although the RNN literature is expansive and highly developed, uncertainty quantification is often ignored. Even when considered, the uncertainty is generally quantified without the use of a rigorous framework, such as a fully Bayesian setting. Here we attempt to quantify uncertainty in a more formal framework while maintaining the forecast accuracy that makes these models appealing, by presenting a Bayesian RNN model for nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting. Additionally, we make simple modifications to the basic RNN to help accommodate the unique nature of nonlinear spatio-temporal data.

Despite PD-L1 expression being the standard biomarker used before the start of therapy, there is still a strict need to identify complementary non-invasive biomarkers in order to better select patients. In this context, radiomics is an emerging approach for examining medical images and clinical data by capturing multiple features hidden from human eye and is potentially able to predict response assessment and survival in the course of immunotherapy. We reviewed the available studies investigating the role of radiomics in cancer patients, focusing on non-small cell lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although preliminary research shows encouraging results, different issues need to be solved before radiomics can enter into clinical practice. Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have demonstrated encouraging results in terms of durable clinical benefit and survival in several malignancies. Nevertheless, the search to identify an “ideal” biomarker for predicting response to ICI is still far from over. Radiomics is a new translational field of study aiming to extract, by dedicated software, several features from a given medical image, ranging from intensity distribution and spatial heterogeneity to higher-order statistical parameters. Based on these premises, our review aims to summarize the current status of radiomics as a potential predictor of clinical response following immunotherapy treatment. A comprehensive search of PubMed results was conducted. All studies published in English up to and including December 2021 were selected, comprising those that explored computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) for radiomic analyses in the setting of ICI. Several studies have demonstrated the potential applicability of radiomic features in the monitoring of the therapeutic response beyond the traditional morphologic and metabolic criteria, as well as in the prediction of survival or non-invasive assessment of the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, important limitations emerge from our review in terms of standardization in feature selection, data sharing, and methods, as well as in external validation. Additionally, there is still need for prospective clinical trials to confirm the potential significant role of radiomics during immunotherapy.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",7fe84005-586f-4604-98ee-fa60fe8ae618,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,11,N/A,2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,18,68,"A.

A prior validation of the immunoscore for breast cancer (ISBC) was made on the basis of a systematic assessment of immune landscapes extrapolated from a large number of neoplastic transcripts. Our goal was to develop a non-invasive radiomics-based ISBC predictive factor. Methods Immunocell fractions of 22 different categories were evaluated using CIBERSORT on the basis of a large, open breast cancer cohort derived from comprehensive information on gene expression. The ISBC was constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model derived from the Immunocell type scores, with 479 quantified features in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions as observed from DCE-MRI. A radiomics signature [radiomics ImmunoScore (RIS)] was developed for the prediction of ISBC using a random forest machine-learning algorithm, and we further evaluated its relationship with prognosis. Results An ISBC consisting of seven different immune cells was established through the use of a LASSO model. Multivariate analyses showed that the ISBC was an independent risk factor in prognosis (HR=2.42, with a 95% CI of 1.49–3.93; P<0.01). A radiomic signature of 21 features of the ISBC was then exploited and validated (the areas under the curve [AUC] were 0.899 and 0.815).

Thus, new anti-ASFV drugs need to be urgently identified. Recently, we identified pentagastrin as a potential antiviral drug against ASFVs using molecular docking and machine learning models. However, the scoring functions are easily influenced by properties of protein pockets, resulting in a scoring bias. Here, we employed the 5′-P binding pocket of AsfvPolX as a potential binding site to identify antiviral drugs and classified 13 AsfvPolX structures into three classes based on pocket parameters calculated by the SiteMap module. We then applied principal component analysis to eliminate this scoring bias, which was effective in making the SP Glide score more balanced between 13 AsfvPolX structures in the dataset. As a result, we identified cangrelor and fostamatinib as potential antiviral drugs against ASFVs. Furthermore, the classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein can provide an alternative approach to identify novel antiviral drugs by optimizing the scoring function of the docking programs. Here, we report a machine learning-based novel approach to generate high binding affinity compounds that are individually matched to the available classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,22,N/A,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,6,34,"Jiwon Choi, D.

Its genome is in the range of 170~193 kbp and encodes 68 structural proteins and over 100 non-structural proteins. Its high pathogenicity strains cause nearly 100% mortality in swine. Consisting of four layers of protein shells and an inner genome, its structure is obviously more complicated than many other viruses, and its multi-layered structures play different kinds of roles in ASFV replication and survival. Each layer possesses many proteins, but very few of the proteins have been investigated at a structural level. Here, we concluded all the ASFV proteins whose structures were unveiled, and explained their functions from the view of structures. Those structures include ASFV AP endonuclease, dUTPases (E165R), pS273R protease, core shell proteins p15 and p35, non-structural proteins pA151R, pNP868R (RNA guanylyltransferase), major capsid protein p72 (gene B646L), Bcl-2-like protein A179L, histone-like protein pA104R, sulfhydryl oxidase pB119L, polymerase X and ligase.

Currently known flavonoids with anti-ASFV activity demonstrate a wide range of antiviral mechanisms, which motivates exploration of new antiviral candidates within this class. The objective of this study was to determine whether other flavonoids may significantly inhibit ASFV infection in vitro. We performed a cell-based library screen of 90 flavonoids. Our screening method allowed us to track the development of virus-induced cytopathic effect by MTT in the presence of tested flavonoids. This screening method was shown to be robust for hit identification, with an average Z-factor of 0.683. We identified nine compounds that inhibit ASFV Ba71V strain in Vero cells. Among them, kaempferol was the most potent and exhibited dose-dependent inhibition, which occurred through a virostatic effect. Time-of-addition studies revealed that kaempferol acts on the entry and post-entry stages of the ASFV replication cycle and impairs viral protein and DNA synthesis. It was further identified that kaempferol induces autophagy in ASFV-infected Vero cells, which is related to its antiviral activity and could be partially abrogated by the addition of an autophagy inhibitor. Kaempferol also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of a highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate in porcine macrophages. Together, these findings support that kaempferol is a promising anti-ASFV agent and has a distinct antiviral mechanism compared to other anti-ASFV flavonoids.",Frontiers in Microbiology,journal,['JournalArticle'],25a655e4-17da-4bfc-a246-5cd20202068d,Frontiers in Microbiology,,12,N/A,2021,2021-10-21 00:00:00,30,54,"E.

The mortality rate of the most acute and acute ASF infection is almost 100%. The World Organization for Animal Health [Office International des épizooties (OIE)] lists it as a legally reported animal disease and China lists it as class I animal epidemic. Since the first diagnosed ASF case in China on August 3, 2018, it has caused huge economic losses to animal husbandry. ASF is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), which is the only member of Asfarviridae family. ASFV is and the only insect-borne DNA virus belonging to the Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) family with an icosahedral structure and an envelope. Till date, there are still no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs for the prevention or treatment of ASF. The complex viral genome and its sophisticated ability to regulate the host immune response may be the reason for the difficulty in developing an effective vaccine. This review summarizes the recent findings on ASFV structure, the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection and immunosuppression, and ASFV-encoded proteins to provide comprehensive proteomic information for basic research on ASFV. In addition, it also analyzes the results of previous studies and speculations on the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection, which aids the study of the mechanism of clinical pathological phenomena, and provides a possible direction for an intensive study of ASFV infection mechanism. By summarizing the findings on molecular mechanism of ASFV- regulated host cell immune response, this review provides orientations and ideas for fundamental research on ASFV and provides a theoretical basis for the development of protective vaccines against ASFV.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,12,N/A,2021,2021-09-06 00:00:00,102,92,"Yue Wang, W.

In this work, we show how deep learning can be used to advance the research field of photochemistry by learning all important properties—multiple energies, forces, and different couplings—for photodynamics simulations. We simplify such simulations substantially by (i) a phase-free training skipping costly preprocessing of raw quantum chemistry data; (ii) rotationally covariant nonadiabatic couplings, which can either be trained or (iii) alternatively be approximated from only ML potentials, their gradients, and Hessians; and (iv) incorporating spin–orbit couplings. As the deep-learning method, we employ SchNet with its automatically determined representation of molecular structures and extend it for multiple electronic states. In combination with the molecular dynamics program SHARC, our approach termed SchNarc is tested on two polyatomic molecules and paves the way toward efficient photodynamics simulations of complex systems.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,journal,['JournalArticle'],45c7ef3c-e436-428b-a856-c8d5b31b603b,The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,3828 - 3834,11,N/A,2020,2020-02-17 00:00:00,128,121,"Julia Westermayr, M.

However, the pervasiveness of web browsing in our daily life does not come without security risks. This widespread practice of web browsing in combination with web users’ low situational awareness against cyber attacks, exposes them to a variety of threats, such as phishing, malware and profiling. Phishing attacks can compromise a target, individual or enterprise, through social interaction alone. Moreover, in the current threat landscape phishing attacks typically serve as an attack vector or initial step in a more complex campaign. To make matters worse, past work has demonstrated the inability of denylists, which are the default phishing countermeasure, to protect users from the dynamic nature of phishing URLs. In this context, our work uses supervised machine learning to block phishing attacks, based on a novel combination of features that are extracted solely from the URL. We evaluate our performance over time with a dataset which consists of active phishing attacks and compare it with Google Safe Browsing (GSB), i.e., the default security control in most popular web browsers. We find that our work outperforms GSB in all of our experiments, as well as performs well even against phishing URLs which are active one year after our model’s training.",Future Internet,journal,['JournalArticle'],c3e5f1c8-9ba7-47e5-acde-53063a69d483,Future Internet,154,13,N/A,2021,2021-06-13 00:00:00,39,48,"Andrei M.

As a result, an enormous amount of personal information and financial transactions become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Phishing is an example of a highly effective form of cybercrime that enables criminals to deceive users and steal important data. Since the first reported phishing attack in 1990, it has been evolved into a more sophisticated attack vector. At present, phishing is considered one of the most frequent examples of fraud activity on the Internet. Phishing attacks can lead to severe losses for their victims including sensitive information, identity theft, companies, and government secrets. This article aims to evaluate these attacks by identifying the current state of phishing and reviewing existing phishing techniques. Studies have classified phishing attacks according to fundamental phishing mechanisms and countermeasures discarding the importance of the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing. This article proposes a new detailed anatomy of phishing which involves attack phases, attacker’s types, vulnerabilities, threats, targets, attack mediums, and attacking techniques. Moreover, the proposed anatomy will help readers understand the process lifecycle of a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of these phishing attacks and the techniques being used; also, it helps in developing a holistic anti-phishing system. Furthermore, some precautionary countermeasures are investigated, and new strategies are suggested.",Frontiers of Computer Science,Unknown,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",Unknown,,,3,Unknown,2021,2021-03-09 00:00:00,242,123,"Zainab Alkhalil, C.

The financial sector is the primary target of phishing, and there are many different approaches to combat phishing attacks. Software-based detection approaches are more prominent in phishing detection; however, still, there is no robust solution that can stable for a long period. The primary purpose of this paper is to propose a novel solution to detect phishing attacks using a combined model of LSTM and CNN deep networks with the use of both URLs and HTML pages. The URLs are learned using an LSTM network with 1D convolutional, and another 1D convolutional network is used to learn the HTML features. These two networks were trained separately and combined through a sigmoid layer by dropping the last layer of each model to have the proposed model. The proposed model reached 98.34% in terms of accuracy, and that is above the previously recorded highest accuracy of 97.3% among the detection models used both URL and HTML features in the explored literature. The solution requires feature extraction only with HTML pages, and URLs were directly fed with a minimum pre-processing. Although the proposed solution uses extracted HTML features, those do not depend on third-party services. Therefore, an efficient real-time application can be implemented using the proposed model to detect phishing attacks to safeguard Internet users.",International Journal of Advances in Applied Sciences,journal,,58f3d4ea-da1a-4755-85de-db89c331483c,International Journal of ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES,,,N/A,2020,2020-07-01 00:00:00,16,50,Ariyadasa et al.,2136758782,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0b3ed9172c5c011cd578b895fed056e28fa20da,Computer Science,2136758782

Based on observations from four monitoring wells, the persistence and periodicities of the loose porous aquifers, and the interrelation between precipitation and groundwater levels was examined based on a number of tools including autocorrelation, cross-correlation, spectral analysis, and wavelet transform. The results show that the groundwater levels at W1 and W2 present a downward trend while those at W3 and W4 show an upward trend. The dominant time period increases from 2.1 years (upstream) to 3.7 years (downstream). The time lags between aquifers and rainfall at W1, W2, W3 and W4 are 139.14 ± 59.76 days (2008–2020), 23.27 ± 12.03 days (2005–2014), 145.01 ± 68.00 days (2007–2020), and 59.22 ± 26.14 days (2005–2019), respectively. The lags for the pumping years are 1.2~2.1 times of those during the years without pumping. The recharge ratio overestimated by the water table fluctuation method decreases from 0.32 at W2 to 0.17 at W4, suggesting that the site W2 has a good potentiality for groundwater recharge.

This study reviews the most commonly used conventional numerical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting GWL. Significant advancements have been made in terms of prediction efficiency over the last two decades. However, while researchers have primarily focused on predicting monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly GWL, water managers and strategists require multi-year GWL simulations to take effective steps towards ensuring the sustainable supply of groundwater. In this paper, we consider a collection of state-of-the-art theories to develop and design a novel methodology and improve modelling efficiency in this field of evaluation. We examined 109 research articles published from 2008 to 2022 that investigated different modelling techniques. Finally, we concluded that machine learning and deep learning approaches are efficient for modelling GWL. Moreover, we provide possible future research directions and recommendations to enhance the accuracy of GWL prediction models and improve relevant understanding.",Applied Sciences,journal,['Review'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-02-20 00:00:00,40,108,"Junaid Khan, Eunkyu Lee, A.

However, due to the nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision‐making by such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black‐box process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on peer‐reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets. Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top model‐agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage, explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model primarily explained tree‐based ensemble machine learning models. The most common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as tree‐based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability, fairness, and trustworthiness of AI‐enabled health systems and medical devices and, ultimately, the quality of care and outcomes.",Cancer Innovation,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",2b26564e-138e-414c-bfb6-3c706a1f532b,Cancer Innovation,,3,N/A,2024,2024-07-03 00:00:00,8,146,"Amirehsan Ghasemi, Soheil Hashtarkhani, David L.

First, the classification and regression tree featuring Gini index is applied to explore the classification criteria of high potassium glass and lead barium glass, and the accuracy of the model is tested by 10-fold cross-validation. Secondly, subclasses were classified for the collected sample data. In this paper, Two Step Cluster Algorithm is used to divide the high potassium glass into four subclasses and the lead barium glass into five subclasses based on the Euclidean distance between the samples. Finally, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between chemical components are computed separately based on the proportion of each chemical component in glass to explore the correlation between them.",Highlights in Science Engineering and Technology,,['JournalArticle'],8139fd99-9b3e-49a1-a8f1-f73376f8bd1a,"Highlights in Science, Engineering and Technology",,,Unknown,2023,2023-04-01 00:00:00,2,2,"Caoyuan Sun, Zewen Li","2214054740, 2109963918",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/455e03a40cfe6f3bef57f4cd842fde3de93e72fd,"Computer Science, Materials Science",2214054740

As a result, they are the principal narrators of the former climate, life, and important events on the surface of the Earth. The complexity and cost of direct destructive laboratory tests adversely affect the data scarcity problem, making the development of intelligent indirect methods an integral step in attempts to address the problem faced by rock engineering projects. This study established an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to predict the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) in MPa of sedimentary rocks using different input parameters; i.e., dry density (ρd) in g/cm3, Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) in MPa, and wet density (ρwet) in g/cm3. The developed ANN models, M1, M2, and M3, were divided as follows: the overall dataset, 70% training dataset and 30% testing dataset, and 60% training dataset and 40% testing dataset, respectively. In addition, multiple linear regression (MLR) was performed for comparison to the proposed ANN models to verify the accuracy of the predicted values. The performance indices were also calculated by estimating the established models. The predictive performance of the M2 ANN model in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), variance accounts for (VAF), and a20-index was 0.831, 0.27672, 0.92, and 0.80, respectively, in the testing dataset, revealing ideal results, thus it was proposed as the best-fit prediction model for UCS of sedimentary rocks at the Thar coalfield, Pakistan, among the models developed in this study. Moreover, by performing a sensitivity analysis, it was determined that BTS was the most influential parameter in predicting UCS.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-03-29 00:00:00,17,57,"Xin Wei, Niaz Muhammad Shahani, Xigui Zheng","2110849533, 101581818, 3630260",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34e6ee72e294c915f7218656fc779ec238bab019,"Engineering, Geology",2110849533
3291d5f8212a1e38afeb5efba6af06244befccba,10.3390/app13063718,Application of Support Vector Machine Algorithm Incorporating Slime Mould Algorithm Strategy in Ancient Glass Classification,"Glass products are important evidence of early East–West cultural exchanges. Ancient glass in China mostly consisted of lead glass, and potassium glass is widely believed to be imported abroad. In order to figure out the origin of glass artefacts, it is crucial to define the type of glass products accurately. In contemporary research on the chemical composition of ancient glass products, potassium glass is separated from lead glass primarily by the weight ratio of oxides or the proportion of lead-containing compounds. This approach can be excessively subjective and prone to mistakes while calculating the mass fraction of compounds containing potassium. So, it is better to find out the link between the proportion of glass’s chemical composition and its classifications during the weathering process of the glass products, to develop an effective classification model using machine learning techniques. In this research, we suggest employing the slime mould approach to optimise the parameters of a support vector machine and examine a 69-group glass chemical composition dataset. In addition, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared to those of commonly used classification models: decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and support vector machines optimised by genetic algorithms (GA-SVM). The results of this research indicated that the support vector machine method with the sticky slime mould algorithm strategy is the most effective.

8da2b038706241b3f30aef9027bdf116c0cac4a7,10.3390/pr11010174,Research on Gas Concentration Prediction Based on the ARIMA-LSTM Combination Model,"The current single gas prediction model is not sufficient for identifying and processing all the characteristics of mine gas concentration time series data. This paper proposes an ARIMA-LSTM combined forecasting model based on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. In the ARIMA-LSTM model, the ARIMA model is used to process the historical data of gas time series and obtain the corresponding linear prediction results and residual series. The LSTM model is used in further analysis of the residual series, predicting the nonlinear factors in the residual series. The prediction results of the combined model are compared separately with those of the two single models. Finally, RMSE, MAPE and R2 are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the three models. The results of the study show that the metrics of the combined ARIMA-LSTM model are R2 = 0.9825, MAPE = 0.0124 and RMSE = 0.083. The combined model has the highest prediction accuracy and the lowest error and is more suitable for the predictive analysis of gas data. By comparing the prediction results of a single model and the combined model on gas time series data, the applicability, validity and scientificity of the combined model proposed in this paper are verified, which is of great importance to accurate prediction and early warning of underground gas danger in coal mines.",Processes,,,939ba3df-4270-4ba0-ad98-ffe889f3546e,Processes,,,Unknown,2023,2023-01-05 00:00:00,10,30,"Chuan Li, X.

Cloud computing provides different services over the internet, thus eliminating the need for personalized hardware and other resources. Cloud computing environments face some challenges in terms of resource utilization, energy efficiency, heterogeneous resources, etc. Tasks scheduling and virtual machines (VMs) are used as consolidation techniques in order to tackle these issues. Tasks scheduling has been extensively studied in the literature. The problem has been studied with different parameters and objectives. In this article, we address the problem of energy consumption and efficient resource utilization in virtualized cloud data centers. The proposed algorithm is based on task classification and thresholds for efficient scheduling and better resource utilization. In the first phase, workflow tasks are pre-processed to avoid bottlenecks by placing tasks with more dependencies and long execution times in separate queues. In the next step, tasks are classified based on the intensities of the required resources. Finally, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to select the best schedules. Experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Comparative results obtained on benchmark datasets are presented. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over that of the other algorithms to which it was compared in terms of energy consumption, makespan, and load balancing.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2021,2021-06-23 00:00:00,32,34,"Nimra Malik, Muhammad Sardaraz, Muhammad Tahir, Babar Shah, Gohar Ali, Fernando Moreira","145433872, 3421647, 2061506769, 2080699552, 1840427122, 152970897",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5738e31f94799cb4cb988e6b439e6437b0a7b020,"Computer Science, Engineering",145433872

When the scale of the problem increases, combinatorial explosion occurs, which makes it difficult for traditional precise algorithms to solve the problem. A hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve problems of process planning. A hierarchical coding method including operation layer, machine layer and logic layer is designed in this algorithm. Each layer of coding corresponds to the decision of a sub-problem of process planning.

899db02ba28ef2479b5bea3e51627685be5b3865,10.3390/s17112556,Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Human Activity Recognition,"Adopting deep learning methods for human activity recognition has been effective in extracting discriminative features from raw input sequences acquired from body-worn sensors. Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time, typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However, the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result, typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity-recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper, we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional, bidirectional, and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on miscellaneous benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform methods employing conventional machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Additionally, the proposed models yield better performance than other deep learning techniques, such as deep believe networks (DBNs) and CNNs.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,396,2017,2017-11-01 00:00:00,382,33,"Abdulmajid Murad, Jae-Young Pyun","30050286, 1739676",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/899db02ba28ef2479b5bea3e51627685be5b3865,"Computer Science, Medicine",30050286

Smart homes embedded with smart devices and sensors enabled many context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. This study presents XAI-HAR, a novel XAI-empowered human activity recognition (HAR) approach based on key features identified from the data collected from sensors located at different places in a smart home. XAI-HAR identifies a set of new features (i.e., the total number of sensors used in a specific activity), as physical key features selection (PKFS) based on weighting criteria. Next, it presents statistical key features selection (SKFS) (i.e., mean, standard deviation) to handle the outliers and higher class variance. The proposed XAI-HAR is evaluated using machine learning models, namely, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and deep learning models such as deep neural network (DNN), convolution neural network (CNN), and CNN-based long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM).

A real-time hand gesture recognition system should aim to develop a user-independent interface with high recognition performance. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show high recognition rates in image classification problems. Due to the unavailability of large labeled image samples in static hand gesture images, it is a challenging task to train deep CNN networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet from scratch. Therefore, inspired by CNN performance, an end-to-end fine-tuning method of a pre-trained CNN model with score-level fusion technique is proposed here to recognize hand gestures in a dataset with a low number of gesture images. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOO CV) and regular CV tests on two benchmark datasets. A real-time American sign language (ASL) recognition system is developed and tested using the proposed technique.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,396,2022,2022-01-18 00:00:00,86,40,"J.

The process of evaluating a value for the GMFM index can be time consuming. It typically takes 45 to 60 min for the patient to complete all tasks, sometimes in two or more sessions. The diagnostic procedure requires trained and specialized therapists. The paper presents the estimation of the GMFM measure for patients with cerebral palsy based on the results of the Zebris FDM-T treadmill. For this purpose, the regression analysis was used. Estimations based on the Generalized Linear Regression were assessed using different error metrics. The results obtained showed that the GMFM score can be estimated with acceptable accuracy. Because the Zebris FDM-T is a widely used device in gait rehabilitation, our method has the potential to be widely adopted for objective diagnostics of children with cerebral palsy.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],7fe84005-586f-4604-98ee-fa60fe8ae618,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,11,N/A,2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,5,71,"Mariusz Bedla, Paweł Pięta, Daniel Kaczmarski, S.

Gait assessment is one of the essential steps of gait management. It has been widely used for clinical decision making and evaluation of different treatment outcomes. However, most of the present methods of gait assessment are subjective, less sensitive to small pathological changes, time-taking and need a great effort of an expert. This work proposes an automated, comprehensive gait assessment score (A-GAS) for gait disorders in CP. Kinematic data of 356 CP and 41 typically developing subjects is used to validate the performance of A-GAS. For the computation of A-GAS, instance abnormality index (AII) and abnormality index (AI) are calculated. AII quantifies gait abnormality of a gait cycle instance, while AI quantifies gait abnormality of a joint angle profile during walking. AII is calculated for all gait cycle instances by performing probabilistic and statistical analyses. Abnormality index (AI) is a weighted sum of AII, computed for each joint angle profile. A-GAS is a weighted sum of AI, calculated for a lower limb. Moreover, a graphical representation of the gait assessment report, including AII, AI, and A-GAS is generated for providing a better depiction of the assessment score. Furthermore, the work compares A-GAS with a present rating-based gait assessment scores to understand fundamental differences. Finally, A-GAS’s performance is verified for a high-cost multi-camera set-up using nine joint angle profiles and a low-cost single camera set-up using three joint angle profiles. Results show no significant differences in performance of A-GAS for both the set-ups. Therefore, A-GAS for both the set-ups can be used interchangeably.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering,journal,['JournalArticle'],416b088d-de72-4dbf-959e-8551984d9676,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,2530-2539,29,N/A,2021,2021-10-05 00:00:00,9,48,"Rishabh Bajpai, D.

A large number of them are installed using trenchless Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) technology. The aim of this work was to develop and compare new machine learning models dedicated for risk assessment in HDD projects. The data from 133 HDD projects from eight countries of the world were gathered, profiled, and preprocessed. Three machine learning models, logistic regression, random forests, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were developed to predict the overall HDD project outcome (failure free installation or installation likely to fail), and the occurrence of identified unwanted events. The best performance in terms of recall and accuracy was achieved for the developed ANN model, which proved to be efficient, fast and robust in predicting risks in HDD projects. Machine learning applications in the proposed models enabled eliminating the involvement of a group of experts in the risk assessment process and therefore significantly lower the costs associated with the risk assessment process. Future research may be oriented towards developing a comprehensive risk management system, which will enable dynamic risk assessment taking into account various combinations of risk mitigation actions.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2021,2021-01-07 00:00:00,13,46,"Maria Krechowicz, Adam Krechowicz","2308018231, 2134270",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4232ee48e7c2408f8c6dddca3d4fca3cee4a7cd8,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",2308018231

Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries.",Nucleic Acids Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],da96c220-cd39-4894-bae6-d2d77c8e7aa9,Nucleic Acids Research,e71 - e71,44,N/A,2015,2015-12-23 00:00:00,2771,38,"A.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixty-eight individuals (mean age 13.3 ± 5.7 years; 35% female, 92% Caucasian) were randomized to HCLC followed by SAP therapy (intensive group; N = 48) or to the usual-care group treated with multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy (N = 20). Primary outcome was C-peptide concentrations during mixed-meal tolerance tests at 12 months. RESULTS Intensive-group participants initiated HCLC a median of 6 days after diagnosis for a median duration of 71.3 h, during which median participant mean glucose concentration was 140 mg/dL (interquartile range 134–153 mg/dL). During outpatient SAP, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use decreased over time, and at 12 months, only 33% of intensive participants averaged sensor use ≥6 days/week. In the usual-care group, insulin pump and CGM use were initiated prior to 12 months by 15 and 5 participants, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were similar in both groups throughout the study. At 12 months, the geometric mean (95% CI) of C-peptide area under the curve was 0.43 (0.34–0.52) pmol/mL in the intensive group and 0.52 (0.32–0.75) pmol/mL in the usual-care group (P = 0.49). Thirty-seven (79%) intensive and 16 (80%) usual-care participants had a peak C-peptide concentration ≥0.2 pmol/mL (P = 0.30).

We investigate the distribution of expression data in human cancer genomes and study the implications of deviations from the normal distribution for translational molecular oncology research. Methods We conducted a central moments analysis of five cancer genomes and performed empiric distribution fitting to examine the true distribution of expression data both on the complete-experiment and on the individual-gene levels. We used a variety of parametric and nonparametric methods to test the effects of deviations from normality on gene calling, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification using a sixth cancer genome. Results Central moments analyses reveal statistically-significant deviations from normality in all of the analyzed cancer genomes. We observe as much as 37% variability in gene calling, 39% variability in functional annotation, and 30% variability in prospective, molecular tumor subclassification associated with this effect. Conclusions Cancer gene expression profiles are not normally-distributed, either on the complete-experiment or on the individual-gene level. Instead, they exhibit complex, heavy-tailed distributions characterized by statistically-significant skewness and kurtosis. The non-Gaussian distribution of this data affects identification of differentially-expressed genes, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification. These effects may be reduced in some circumstances, although not completely eliminated, by using nonparametric analytics. This analysis highlights two unreliable assumptions of translational cancer gene expression analysis: that “small” departures from normality in the expression data distributions are analytically-insignificant and that “robust” gene-calling algorithms can fully compensate for these effects.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,7,N/A,2012,2012-10-31 00:00:00,30,51,"Nicholas F.

However, effectively training deep learning models typically necessitates substantial quantities of high-quality data, a resource often lacking in numerous medical imaging scenarios. One way to overcome this deficiency is to artificially generate such images. Therefore, in this comparative study we train five generative models to artificially increase the amount of available data in such a scenario. This synthetic data approach is evaluated on a a downstream classification task, predicting four causes for pneumonia as well as healthy cases on 1082 chest X-ray images. Quantitative and medical assessments show that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach significantly outperforms more recent diffusion-based approaches on this limited dataset with better image quality and pathological plausibility. We show that better image quality surprisingly does not translate to improved classification performance by evaluating five different classification models and varying the amount of additional training data. Class-specific metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score show a substantial improvement by using synthetic images, emphasizing the data rebalancing effect of less frequent classes. However, overall performance does not improve for most models and configurations, except for a DreamBooth approach which shows a +0.52 improvement in overall accuracy. The large variance of performance impact in this study suggests a careful consideration of utilizing generative models for limited data scenarios, especially with an unexpected negative correlation between image quality and downstream classification improvement.",Bioengineering,journal,['JournalArticle'],103075b0-1b66-4b69-9c47-f54875634fba,Bioengineering,,10,N/A,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,4,68,"Daniel Schaudt, Christian Späte, Reinhold von Schwerin, Manfred Reichert, Marianne von Schwerin, Meinrad Beer, Christopher Kloth","2145260466, 2219655363, 2189632504, 2261720594, 2261719676, 2239385882, 2207671405",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db5ccb1d7e75c23995a42806e8ea2e03b074269d,"Computer Science, Medicine",2145260466

To support our solution, we introduce a multiparty version of the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic cryptosystem and implement it in an open-source library. MHE-based MPC solutions have several advantages: Their transcript is public, their o~ine phase is compact, and their circuit-evaluation procedure is noninteractive. By exploiting these properties, the communication complexity of MPC tasks is reduced from quadratic to linear in the number of parties, thus enabling secure computation among potentially thousands of parties and in a broad variety of computing paradigms, from the traditional peer-to-peer setting to cloud-outsourcing and smart-contract technologies. MHE-based approaches can also outperform the state-of-the-art solutions, even for a small number of parties. We demonstrate this for three circuits: private input selection with application to private-information retrieval, component-wise vector multiplication with application to private-set intersection, and Beaver multiplication triples generation. For the first circuit, privately selecting one input among eight thousand parties’ (of 32 KB each) requires only 1.31 MB of communication per party and completes in 61.7 seconds. For the second circuit with eight parties, our approach is 8.6 times faster and requires 39.3 times less communication than the current methods. For the third circuit and ten parties, our approach generates 20 times more triples per second while requiring 136 times less communication per-triple than an approach based on oblivious transfer. We implemented our scheme in the Lattigo library and open-sourced the code at github.com/ldsec/lattigo.",Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,,['JournalArticle'],d5dc4224-e4c3-43c9-918a-bd6326650b5b,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,291 - 311,2021,Unknown,2021,2021-07-23 00:00:00,106,59,"C.

This study aimed at developing a predictor model to estimate time on a kidney transplant waiting list using a machine learning approach. Methods A retrospective cohort study including data of patients registered, between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, in the waiting list of São Paulo State Organ Allocation System (SP-OAS) /Brazil. Data were randomly divided into two groups: 75% for training and 25% for testing. A Cox regression model was fitted with deceased donor transplant as the outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different Cox models. Cox hazard ratios were used to develop the risk-prediction equations. Results Of 54,055 records retrieved, 48,153 registries were included in the final analysis. During the study period, approximately 1/3 of the patients were transplanted with a deceased donor. The major characteristics associated with changes in the likelihood of transplantation were age, subregion, cPRA, and frequency of HLA-DR, -B and -A. The model developed was able to predict waiting time with good agreement in internal validation (c-index = 0.70). Conclusion The kidney transplant waiting time calculator developed shows good predictive performance and provides information that may be valuable in assisting candidates and their providers. Moreover, it can significantly improve the use of economic resources and the management of patient care before transplant.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,16,N/A,2021,2021-05-20 00:00:00,10,28,"Juliana Feiman Sapiertein Silva, G.

We retrospectively evaluated the data of kidney transplant procedures until hospital discharge, according to kidney function recovery after the procedure. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the non-sensitized, 1st KTx from deceased donors performed between Jan/2010 to Dec/2017. Results: Out of the 1300 KTx from deceased donors performed in this period, 730 patients were studied and divided into 3 groups: Immediate Renal Function (IRF) - decrease in serum creatinine ≥ 10% on two consecutive days; Delayed Graft Function (DGF) - decrease in serum creatinine <10% on two consecutive days, without the need for dialysis, and Dialysis (D) - need for dialysis during the first week. Patients in group D stayed longer in the hospital compared to DGF and IRF (21, 11 and 8 days respectively, p < 0.001). More D patients (21%) were admitted to the ICU and performed a greater number of laboratory tests (p < 0.001) and renal biopsies (p < 0.001), in addition to receiving a higher amount of immunosuppressants. Total hospital costs were higher in group D and DGF compared to IRF (U$ 7.021,48; U$ 3.603,42 and U$ 2.642,37 respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The costs of the transplant procedure is impacted by the recovery of kidney function after the transplant.

Despite this success, the high risk of premature death and frequent occurrence of graft failure remain important clinical and research challenges. The current burst of studies and other innovative initiatives using artificial intelligence (AI) for a wide range of analytical and practical applications in biomedical areas seems to correlate with the same trend observed in publications in the kidney transplantation field, and points toward the potential of such novel approaches to address the aforementioned aim of improving long-term outcomes of kidney transplant recipients (KTR). However, at the same time, this trend underscores now more than ever the old methodological challenges and potential threats that the research and clinical community needs to be aware of and actively look after with regard to AI-driven evidence. The purpose of this narrative mini-review is to explore challenges for obtaining applicable and adequate kidney transplant data for analyses using AI techniques to develop prediction models, and to propose next steps in the field. We make a call to act toward establishing the strong collaborations needed to bring innovative synergies further augmented by AI, which have the potential to impact the long-term care of KTR. We encourage researchers and clinicians to submit their invaluable research, including original clinical and imaging studies, database studies from registries, meta-analyses, and AI research in the kidney transplantation field.",Transplantology,journal,['Review'],b1053301-2994-4467-922f-a4367851a5e8,Transplantology,118-128,2,N/A,2021,2021-04-06 00:00:00,2,58,"Raúl Castillo-Astorga, Camilo G.

Early prediction of subclinical mastitis can enable dairy farmers to perform interventions to mitigate its effect. The present study investigated how well predictive models built using machine learning techniques can detect subclinical mastitis up to 7 d before its occurrence. The data set used consisted of 1,346,207 milk-day (i.e., a day when milk was collected on both morning and evening) records spanning 9 yr from 2,389 cows producing on 7 Irish research farms. Individual cow composite milk yield and maximum milk flow were available twice daily, whereas milk composition (i.e., fat, lactose, protein) and somatic cell count (SCC) were collected once per week. Other features describing parity, calving dates, predicted transmitting ability for SCC, body weight, and history of subclinical mastitis were also available. The results of the study showed that a gradient boosting machine model trained to predict the onset of subclinical mastitis 7 d before a subclinical case occurs achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 69.45 and 95.64%, respectively. Reduced data collection frequency, where milk composition and SCC were recorded only every 15, 30, 45, and 60 d was simulated by masking data, to reflect the frequency of recording of this data on commercial dairy farms in Ireland. The sensitivity and specificity scores reduced as recording frequency reduced with respective scores of 66.93 and 80.43% when milk composition and SCC were recorded just every 60 d. Results demonstrate that models built on data that could be recorded routinely available on commercial dairy farms, can achieve useful predictive ability of subclinical mastitis even with reduced frequency of milk composition and SCC recording.",Journal of Dairy Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],7da561cd-ebc2-42ae-96b3-244a5c401c38,Journal of dairy science,,,N/A,2023,2023-05-31 00:00:00,10,51,"A.

We studied the effect of mastitis on cow milk yield, the effect of mastitis on udder surface skin temperature, and the dependence between severity of mastitis and udder temperature. We determined the presence of a significant relationship between the udder surface skin temperature and the milk yield of mastitis cows (Coefficient of determination = 0.886, linear Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.96), as well as the absence of a significant relationship between the udder surface skin temperature and the milk yield of healthy cows (Coefficient of determination = 0.029, linear Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.16). We substantiated the temperature ranges of the udder surface of healthy cows [32–35.9 °C] and mastitis [36.1–39 °C]. The obtained data made it possible to form an algorithm that allows a quick assessment of the herd for the presence of udder disease, using infrared images of the udder surface skin temperature.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-30 00:00:00,11,25,"A.

In this study, we adopt eight machine learning algorithms using an R software for analyzing a dataset of 14-dimensions of dairy cows with health disorders across the whole lactation period in intensive Chinese dairy farms, applying automatic monitoring systems and milking systems. The variables analyzed by the machine learning algorithms include milk yield, physical activity, changes in rumination time, and the electrical conductivity of milk. Six parameters were presented to evaluate the performance metrics of the models, with the Rpart algorithm outperforming others and indicating a strong generalization ability of this algorithm. A total of 10 variables of greater importance in three models of Rpart, eXtreme Gradient, and Adaboost demonstrated the consistency of those variables as predictors for disorders of dairy cows monitored by automatic systems. The results obtained in this study highlighted the importance of using big data on the farm to develop predictive and prescriptive decision support tools to boost the development of precision livestock farming. Abstract We use multidimensional data from automated monitoring systems and milking systems to predict disorders of dairy cows by employing eight machine learning algorithms. The data included the season, days in milking, parity, age at the time of disorders, milk yield (kg/day), activity (unitless), six variables related to rumination time, and two variables related to the electrical conductivity of milk. We analyze 131 sick cows and 149 healthy cows with identical lactation days and parity; all data are collected on the same day, which corresponds to the diagnosis day for disordered cows. For disordered cows, each variable, except the ratio of rumination time from daytime to nighttime, displays a decreasing/increasing trend from d-7 or d-3 to d0 and/or d-1, with the d0, d-1, or d-2 values reaching the minimum or maximum. The test data sensitivity for three algorithms exceeded 80%, and the accuracies of the eight algorithms ranged from 65.08% to 84.21%. The area under the curve (AUC) of the three algorithms was >80%. Overall, Rpart best predicts the disorders with an accuracy, precision, and AUC of 81.58%, 92.86%, and 0.908, respectively. The machine learning algorithms may be an appropriate and powerful decision support and monitoring tool to detect herds with common health disorders.",Animals,,['JournalArticle'],2c30e84c-941b-45b8-b015-9284a1afdb14,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,,12,Unknown,2022,2022-05-01 00:00:00,27,32,"Xiaojing Zhou, Chuang Xu, Hao Wang, Wei Xu, Zixuan Zhao, Meng Chen, Bin Jia, Baoyin Huang","2110695809, 143776874, 2144221670, 2155782833, 50144643, 1745546, 2214291694, 51295960",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f1cd241a20b3cd0445a4b8892208baca8df5cfe,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science, Medicine",2110695809

The increasing performance of thermal cameras over time and their usability in different areas increase their use in livestocks. Infrared thermography (IRT) technology is a noninvasive method that can estimate the surface temperature of objects. The objective of this study was to evaluate early detection of mastitis in Holstein-Friesian dairy cattle by using both udder surface temperatures (Tmax) from images obtained with the help of a FLIR One Pro thermal camera and some parameters such as Lab (CIE L*, a*, b*), HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness), RGB (Red, Green, Blue) by processing thermal images with the help of ImageJ program via classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. According to CMT by using CART analysis in this study, 64.9% of cows with udder surface temperature lower than 38.85 were healthy, and 73.3% of cows higher than 38.85 were determined as unhealthy. As for SCC, 77.6% of cows with udder surface temperature lower than 38.65 were healthy and 58.6% of cows with higher than 38.65 were determined as unhealthy. The areas under ROC (AUC) were found to be statistically significant in the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis. (P 0.05). As a result, IRT technology can be used as a useful diagnostic tool in the early detection of mastitis.",Selcuk journal of agriculture and food sciences,journal,,a3faf61c-1475-47d2-be86-d328c39132d5,Selcuk Journal of Agricultural and Food Sciences,,,N/A,2021,2021-08-08 00:00:00,10,63,"Gizem Coşkun, I.

Within the fields of urology and gynecology, conditions such as overactive bladder (OAB) and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) have been identified as crucial concerns due to their negative impact on the quality of life of elderly individuals. In this study, we investigated the potential of Ninjin'yoeito (NYT), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, as a viable treatment option for frailty. Additionally, we hypothesized that NYT may also contribute to the improvement of symptoms associated with OAB and GSM, and potentially help in reducing the dosage of OAB medications. Methods In this retrospective cohort study conducted from November 2016 to November 2022, we created a website describing the relationship between frailty and genitourinary symptoms in frail patients aged ≥ 65 years with GSM who underwent pelvic floor muscle training. The patients were divided into two propensity score-matched groups: NYT group (received NYT for one year) and no-NYT group (did not receive NYT), based on their wishes. The fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight (FRAIL) scale was used to assess frailty status. Urinary symptoms were evaluated using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). Genital symptoms were investigated using the vaginal health index score and vulvodynia swab test. The value of each score was obtained before (T0) and 12 months after (T12) treatment, and the difference (ΔT0/T12) was calculated. Results During the study period, 985 outpatients visited our clinic, of whom 725 were considered frail/pre-frail; 402 women with frailty/pre-frailty (mean age 77.5 ± 6.49 years) were included, with a median follow-up of 14.5 months. The NYT and no-NYT groups had 220 and 182 patients, respectively. After propensity score matching, each group had 159 patients. ΔT0/T12FRAIL scale score was significantly higher in the NYT group (0.13 ± 0.37) than in the no-NYT (0.01 ± 0.10) group (p=0.001.) However, urinary symptoms improved in the NYT group more than in the no-NYT in terms of the following parameters: ΔT0/T12OABSS (NYT: 0.89 ± 1.65; no-NYTl: 0.36 ± 1.14, p=0.001) and ΔT0/T12ICIQ-SF score (NYT: 1.51 ± 1.75; no-NYT: 0.42 ± 1.18, p<0.001). Genital symptoms were better in the NYT group in terms of ΔT0/T12VHIS (NYT: 0.58 ±1.08; no-NYT: 0.21 ±0.65, p<0.001). The vulvodynia swab test showed improvements in left para-hymen evoked pain in both groups. In the NYT group, 5% of the patients underwent antimuscarinic drug dose reduction for overactive bladder treatment. NYT use was not associated with significant side effects, and only 0.6% of patients reported drug allergies. Conclusion NYT improved activity levels in frail/pre-frail patients. Moreover, NYT use improved various genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with frailty/pre-frailty. Treatment with NYT may reduce the dose of overactive bladder medications. The anticholinergic load-reducing effect of NYT may help solve the problem of polypharmacy.",Cureus,journal,['JournalArticle'],87c855fc-c59a-4443-832a-e5b1ca14b9f3,Cureus,,15,N/A,2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,7,30,"N.

To address this issue, more and more researchers are examining the relationship between OAB treatment and urinary microecology. In this study, we sought to determine whether differences in treatment efficacy were related to microbiome diversity and composition as well as the abundance of specific genera. Machine learning algorithms were used to construct predictive models for urine microbiota-based treatment of OAB. Methods Urine samples were obtained from 64 adult female OAB patients for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients’ overactive bladder symptom scores (OABSS) were collected before and after mirabegron treatment and patients were divided into effective and ineffective groups. The relationship between the relative abundance of certain genera and OABSS were analyzed. Three machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), supporting vector machine (SVM) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were utilized to predict the therapeutic effect of mirabegron based on the relative abundance of certain genera in OAB patients’ urine microbiome. Results The species composition of the two groups differed. For one, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly higher in the effective group than in the ineffective group. In addition, the relative abundance of Gardnerella and Prevotella in the effective group was significantly lower than in the ineffective group. Alpha-diversity and beta-diversity differed significantly between the two groups. LEfSe analysis revealed that Lactobacillus abundance increased while Prevotella and Gardnerella abundance decreased in the effective group. The Lactobacillus abundance ROC curve had high predictive accuracy. The OABSS after treatment was negatively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus, whereas the relationship between OABSS and Prevotella and Gardnerella showed the opposite trend. In addition, RF, SVM and XGBoost models demonstrated high predictive ability to assess the effect of mirabegron in OAB patients in the test cohort. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that urinary microbiota might influence the efficacy of mirabegron, and that Lactobacillus might be a potential marker for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of mirabegron in OAB patients.",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,journal,['JournalArticle'],a19f6357-d8f7-4235-8304-c659c68ca126,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,12,N/A,2022,2022-11-14 00:00:00,6,33,"Zhipeng Zhou, Yifeng Qiu, Kun Li, Qi Sun, Ming Xie, Pengcheng Huang, Y.

Methods A total of 233 lung adenocarcinoma patients were investigated and randomly divided into the training and test cohorts. In this study, 2300 radiomic features were extracted from original and filtered (Exponential, Laplacian of Gaussian, Logarithm, Gabor, Wavelet) CT images. The radiomic features were divided into four categories, including histogram, volumetric, morphologic, and texture features. An RF-BFE algorithm was developed to select the features for building the prediction models. Clinicopathological features (including age, gender, smoking status, TNM staging, maximum diameter, location, and growth pattern) were combined to establish an integrated model with radiomic features. ROC curve and AUC quantified the effectiveness of the predictor of EGFR mutation status and subtypes. Results A set of 10 features were selected to predict EGFR mutation status between EGFR mutant and wild type, while 9 selected features were used to predict mutation subtypes between exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation. To predict the EGFR mutation status, the AUC of the training cohort was 0.778 and the AUC of the test cohort was 0.765. To predict the EGFR mutation subtypes, the AUC of training cohort was 0.725 and the AUC of test cohort was 0.657. The integrated model showed the most optimal predictive performance with EGFR mutation status (AUC = 0.870 and 0.759) and subtypes (AUC = 0.797 and 0.554) in the training and test cohorts. Conclusion CT-based radiomic features can extract information on tumor heterogeneity in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we have established a radiomic model and an integrated model to non-invasively predict the EGFR mutation status and subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, which is conducive to saving clinical costs and guiding targeted therapy.",OncoTargets and Therapy,journal,['JournalArticle'],a3c92136-86d8-407a-9c91-45bd53eb2c77,OncoTargets and therapy,597 - 608,15,N/A,2022,2022-05-01 00:00:00,5,37,"Quan Chen, Yan Li, Qiguang Cheng, Juno S.

However, the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same time, which leads to unsatisfactory results. To mitigate this problem, we propose PairRE, a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. The paired vectors enable an adaptive adjustment of the margin in loss function to fit for different complex relations. Besides, PairRE is capable of encoding three important relation patterns, symmetry/antisymmetry, inverse and composition. Given simple constraints on relation representations, PairRE can encode subrelation further. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities of PairRE.

Therefore, the ability to correctly and quickly predict the effect of amino acid mutations is crucial for understanding disease effects and to be able to carry out genome-wide studies. Here, we report a new development of the SAAMBE method, SAAMBE-3D, which is a machine learning-based approach, resulting in accurate predictions and is extremely fast. It achieves the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 0.82 depending on the training protocol in benchmarking five-fold validation test against the SKEMPI v2.0 database and outperforms currently existing algorithms on various blind-tests. Furthermore, optimized and tested via five-fold cross-validation on the Cornell University dataset, the SAAMBE-3D achieves AUC of 1.0 and 0.96 on a homo and hereto-dimer test datasets. Another important feature of SAAMBE-3D is that it is very fast, it takes less than a fraction of a second to complete a prediction. SAAMBE-3D is available as a web server and as well as a stand-alone code, the last one being another important feature allowing other researchers to directly download the code and run it on their local computer. Combined all together, SAAMBE-3D is an accurate and fast software applicable for genome-wide studies to assess the effect of amino acid mutations on protein–protein interactions. The webserver and the stand-alone codes (SAAMBE-3D for predicting the change of binding free energy and SAAMBE-3D-DN for predicting if the mutation is disruptive or non-disruptive) are available.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,21,N/A,2020,2020-04-01 00:00:00,69,61,"S.

Typically based on signal strength measurement, a power level map is created first in the learning phase to align with measured values in the inference. Second, the location is determined by taking the point for which the recorded received power level is closest to the power level actually measured. The biggest limit of this technique is the reliability of power measurements, which may lack accuracy in many wireless systems. To this end, this work extends the power level measurement by using multiple anchors and multiple radio channels and, consequently, considers different approaches to aligning the actual measurements with the recorded values. The dataset is available online. This article focuses on the very popular radio technology Bluetooth Low Energy to explore the possible improvement of the system accuracy through different machine learning approaches. It shows how the accuracy–complexity trade-off influences the possible candidate algorithms on an example of three-channel Bluetooth received signal strength based fingerprinting in a one dimensional environment with four static anchors and in a two dimensional environment with the same set of anchors. We provide a literature survey to identify the machine learning algorithms applied in the literature to show that the studies available can not be compared directly. Then, we implement and analyze the performance of four most popular supervised learning techniques, namely k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. In our scenario, the most promising machine learning technique being the Random Forest with classification accuracy over 99%.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,396,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,37,44,"L.

Previous work indicated that these reads are characterized by erroneous split-read support that is interpreted as evidence of structural variants. Thus, a large number of false-positive structural variants are detected. To our knowledge, no tool is currently available to specifically call or filter structural variants in FFPE samples. To overcome this gap, we developed 2 R packages: SimFFPE and FilterFFPE. Results SimFFPE is a read simulator, specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data from FFPE samples. A mixture of characteristic artifact chimeric reads, as well as normal reads, is generated. FilterFFPE is a filtration algorithm, removing artifact chimeric reads from sequencing data while keeping real chimeric reads. To evaluate the performance of FilterFFPE, we performed structural variant calling with 3 common tools (Delly, Lumpy, and Manta) with and without prior filtration with FilterFFPE. After applying FilterFFPE, the mean positive predictive value improved from 0.27 to 0.48 in simulated samples and from 0.11 to 0.27 in real samples, while sensitivity remained basically unchanged or even slightly increased. Conclusions FilterFFPE improves the performance of SV calling in FFPE samples.

These genes have the greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have diverse molecular functions that include the formation, structure, and function of the synapse. The associations of NMDA receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for the dysfunction of the glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We find significant evidence for an overlap of rare variant risk between schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and severe neurodevelopmental disorders (DD/ID), supporting a neurodevelopmental etiology for schizophrenia. We show that protein-truncating variants in GRIN2A, TRIO, and CACNA1G confer risk for schizophrenia whereas specific missense mutations in these genes confer risk for DD/ID. Nevertheless, few of the strongly associated schizophrenia genes appear to confer risk for DD/ID. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare variant risk, suggesting that common and rare genetic risk factors at least partially converge on the same underlying pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry a substantial excess of URVs, implying that more schizophrenia risk genes await discovery using this approach.",medRxiv,journal,,d5e5b5e7-54b1-4f53-82fc-4853f3e71c58,medRxiv,,,N/A,2020,2020-09-18 00:00:00,108,80,"T.

In this study, we conducted a TWAS using gene expression data from GTEx and summary statistics from the hitherto largest GWAS meta-analysis conducted for breast cancer overall, and by estrogen receptor subtypes (ER+ and ER−). We further compared associations with ER+ and ER− subtypes, using a case-only TWAS approach. We also conducted multigene conditional analyses in regions with multiple TWAS associations. Two genes, STXBP4 and HIST2H2BA, were specifically associated with ER+ but not with ER− breast cancer. We further identified 30 TWAS-significant genes associated with overall breast cancer risk, including four that were not identified in previous studies. Conditional analyses identified single independent breast-cancer gene in three of six regions harboring multiple TWAS-significant genes. Our study provides new information on breast cancer genetics and biology, particularly about genomic differences between ER+ and ER− breast cancer.",Genetic Epidemiology,journal,,0bebd3b7-9bc2-4d76-9916-59f72f7a4d30,Genetic epidemiology,442 - 468,44,N/A,2020,2020-03-01 00:00:00,36,67,"Helian Feng, Alexander Gusev, B.

Nevertheless, the complexity and non-linear behaviour associated with such kind of energy systems hinder the development of accurate algorithms. In such a context, this paper investigates the use of a state-of-art deep learning architecture in order to perform precise load demand forecasting 24-h-ahead in the whole country of France using RTE data. To this end, the authors propose an encoder-decoder architecture inspired by WaveNet, a deep generative model initially designed by Google DeepMind for raw audio waveforms. WaveNet uses dilated causal convolutions and skip-connection to utilise long-term information. This kind of novel ML architecture presents different advantages regarding other statistical algorithms. On the one hand, the proposed deep learning model’s training process can be parallelized in GPUs, which is an advantage in terms of training times compared to recurrent networks. On the other hand, the model prevents degradations problems (explosions and vanishing gradients) due to the residual connections. In addition, this model can learn from an input sequence to produce a forecast sequence in a one-shot manner. For comparison purposes, a comparative analysis between the most performing state-of-art deep learning models and traditional statistical approaches is presented: Autoregressive-Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-Short-Term-Memory, Gated-Recurrent-Unit (GRU), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), causal 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) and ConvLSTM (Encoder-Decoder). The values of the evaluation indicators reveal that WaveNet exhibits superior performance in both forecasting accuracy and robustness.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2021,2021-04-28 00:00:00,36,48,"Fernando Dorado Rueda, Jaime Durán Suárez, Alejandro del Real Torres","2172128473, 2172129915, 2172246209",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89b099527f7bcea0b740821251559d3442c9585f,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",2172128473

An accurate prediction of power load can provide a reliable decision for power system management. To solve the limitation of the existing load forecasting methods in dealing with time-series data, causing the poor stability and non-ideal forecasting accuracy, this paper proposed an attention-based encoder-decoder network with Bayesian optimization to do the accurate short-term power load forecasting. Proposed model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with a gated recurrent units (GRU) recurrent neural network with high robustness on time-series data modeling. The temporal attention layer focuses on the key features of input data that play a vital role in promoting the prediction accuracy for load forecasting. Finally, the Bayesian optimization method is used to confirm the model’s hyperparameters to achieve optimal predictions. The verification experiments of 24 h load forecasting with real power load data from American Electric Power (AEP) show that the proposed model outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy and algorithm stability, providing an effective approach for migrating time-serial power load prediction by deep-learning technology.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2021,2021-03-13 00:00:00,119,63,"Xue-bo Jin, Weiguang Zheng, Jianlei Kong, Xiaoyi Wang, Yuting Bai, Tingli Su, Seng Lin","40430910, 2152973806, 26434105, 50141969, 3768636, 2847804, 2115208297",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca47d9ba0902cdd27ac7b54ed7c94b605da3ecf5,"Computer Science, Engineering",40430910

Moreover, a push for electrical vehicle and other economic developments are expected to further increase energy use. To combat these challenges, electrical load forecasting is essential as it supports energy production planning and scheduling, assists with budgeting, and helps identify saving opportunities. Machine learning approaches commonly used for energy forecasting such as feedforward neural networks and support vector regression encounter challenges with capturing time dependencies. Consequently, this paper proposes Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Network (S2S RNN) with Attention for electrical load forecasting. The S2S architecture from language translation is adapted for load forecasting and a corresponding sample generation approach is designed. RNN enables capturing time dependencies present in the load data and S2S model further improves time modeling by combining two RNNs: encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism alleviates the burden of connecting encoder and decoder. The experiments evaluated attention mechanisms with different RNN cells (vanilla, LSTM, and GRU) and with varied time horizons. Results show that S2S with Bahdanau attention outperforms other models. Accuracy decreases as forecasting horizon increases; however, longer input sequences do not always increase accuracy.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,36411-36426,8,N/A,2020,2020-02-21 00:00:00,131,39,"Ljubisa Sehovac, Katarina Grolinger","1380993111, 2222599",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3c897df9bbdc2fd32f99e5d9fa2ffadff0820e8,"Computer Science, Engineering",1380993111

Consequently, this implies a substantial increase in the amount of personal data collected, transported, processed, and stored. The authors of this paper designed and implemented an integrated personal health data management system, which considers data-driven software and hardware sensors, comprehensive data privacy techniques, and machine-learning-based algorithmic models. It was determined that there are very few relevant and complete surveys concerning this specific problem. Therefore, the current scientific research was considered, and this paper comprehensively analyzes the importance of deep learning techniques that are applied to the overall management of data collected by data-driven soft sensors. This survey considers aspects that are related to demographics, health and body parameters, and human activity and behaviour pattern detection. Additionally, the relatively complex problem of designing and implementing data privacy mechanisms, while ensuring efficient data access, is also discussed, and the relevant metrics are presented. The paper concludes by presenting the most important open research questions and challenges.

The study explored the use of the random forest regression (RFR), a supervised machine learning (ML) model, as an alternative to the physically based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for predicting streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters near Del Norte, a snowmelt-dominated mountainous watershed of the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Remotely sensed data were used for the random forest machine learning analysis (RFML) and RStudio for data processing and synthesizing. The RFML model outperformed the SWAT model in accuracy and demonstrated its capability in predicting streamflow in this region. We implemented a customized approach to the RFR model to assess the model’s performance for three training periods, across 1991–2010, 1996–2010, and 2001–2010; the results indicated that the model’s accuracy improved with longer training periods, implying that the model trained on a more extended period is better able to capture the parameters’ variability and reproduce streamflow data more accurately. The variable importance (i.e., IncNodePurity) measure of the RFML model revealed that the snow depth and the minimum temperature were consistently the top two predictors across all training periods. The paper also evaluated how well the SWAT model performs in reproducing streamflow data of the watershed with a conventional approach. The SWAT model needed more time and data to set up and calibrate, delivering acceptable performance in annual mean streamflow simulation, with satisfactory index of agreement (d), coefficient of determination (R2), and percent bias (PBIAS) values, but monthly simulation warrants further exploration and model adjustments. The study recommends exploring snowmelt runoff hydrologic processes, dust-driven sublimation effects, and more detailed topographic input parameters to update the SWAT snowmelt routine for better monthly flow estimation. The results provide a critical analysis for enhancing streamflow prediction, which is valuable for further research and water resource management, including snowmelt-driven semi-arid regions.",Remote Sensing,journal,['JournalArticle'],8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

In this paper, a multi-scale-variables-driven streamflow forecasting (MVDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy and provide more information for decision-making. This framework was realized by integrating random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with multi-scale variables (hydrometeorological and climate predictors) as inputs and is referred to as RF-GPR-MV. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the RF-GPR-MV model, it was implemented for multi-step-ahead monthly streamflow forecasts with horizons of 1 to 12 months for two key hydrological stations in the Jinsha River basin, Southwest China. Other MVDSF models based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and GPR with/without multi-scale variables or the PCC and a backpropagation neural network (BP) or general regression neural network (GRNN), with only previous streamflow and precipitation, namely, PCC-GPR-MV, PCC-GPR-QP, PCC-BP-QP, and PCC-GRNN-QP, respectively, were selected as benchmarks. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model was superior to the other benchmark models in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for almost all forecasting scenarios, especially for forecasting with longer lead times. Additionally, the results also confirmed that the addition of large-scale climate and circulation factors was beneficial for promoting the streamflow forecasting ability, with an average contribution rate of about 15%. The RF in the MVDSF framework improved the forecasting performance, with an average contribution rate of about 25%. This improvement was more pronounced when the lead time exceeded 3 months. Moreover, the proposed model could also provide prediction intervals (PIs) to characterize forecast uncertainty, as supplementary information to further help decision makers in relevant departments to avoid risks in water resources management.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-06 00:00:00,22,56,"Na Sun, Shuai Zhang, Tian Peng, N.

Herein OCE was applied to evaluate previously inaccessible biomechanical characteristics of human corneal tissue and to study the role of Bowman's layer in corneal biomechanics. Methods Human corneal donor buttons (n = 23) were obtained and Descemet's membrane and endothelium were removed. In 11 corneas, Bowman's layer was ablated by a 20 µm stromal excimer laser ablation. Buttons were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber and subjected to a pressure modulation from 10 to 30 mm Hg, and back to 10 mm Hg, in steps of 1 mm Hg. At each step, a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scan was obtained. Displacements were analyzed by optical flow tracking, and strain over the entire stromal depth was retrieved from the phase gradient of the complex interference signal. Results During pressure increase, corneal tissue moved upward (486–585 nm/mm Hg) but did not fully recover (Δ= 2.63 to 8.64 µm) after pressure decrease. Vertical corneal strain distribution was negative in the anterior and positive in the posterior cornea, indicating simultaneous corneal compression and expansion, respectively. Bowman's layer caused minor localized differences in corneal strain distribution. Conclusions Corneal strain distribution is more complex than previously assumed, with a fundamental difference in mechanical response between the anterior and posterior stroma. Clinically, OCE technology might be used to monitor the progression of corneal ectatic diseases and to determine the success of corneal cross-linking.",Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],e52aeb8d-b929-43a2-b584-f0f5fbcfd9f4,Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science,,61,N/A,2020,2020-06-01 00:00:00,24,34,"S.

Risk prediction of hypertension is an intervention that contributes to the early prevention and management of hypertension. The implementation of such intervention requires an effective and easy-to-implement hypertension risk prediction model. This study evaluated and compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms on predicting the risk of hypertension based on easy-to-collect risk factors. A dataset of 29,700 samples collected through a physical examination was used for model training and testing. Firstly, we identified easy-to-collect risk factors of hypertension, through univariate logistic regression analysis. Then, based on the selected features, 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to optimize four models, random forest (RF), CatBoost, MLP neural network and logistic regression (LR), to find the best hyper-parameters on the training set. Finally, the performance of models was evaluated by AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on the test set. The experimental results showed that the RF model outperformed the other three models, and achieved an AUC of 0.92, an accuracy of 0.82, a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.81. In addition, Body Mass Index (BMI), age, family history and waist circumference (WC) are the four primary risk factors of hypertension. These findings reveal that it is feasible to use machine learning algorithms, especially RF, to predict hypertension risk without clinical or genetic data. The technique can provide a non-invasive and economical way for the prevention and management of hypertension in a large population.",Frontiers in Public Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],d3dd5449-daa1-4d57-9412-9add6037584f,Frontiers in Public Health,,9,N/A,2021,2021-09-24 00:00:00,32,56,"Huanhuan Zhao, Xiaoyu Zhang, Yang Xu, Lisheng Gao, Zuchang Ma, Yining Sun, Weimin Wang","47940978, 2115797509, 2115681606, 1804676886, 2915371, 2548973, 2144318755",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e24c87ea6ebb4a8ff106e1e173708f2f807398c1,"Computer Science, Medicine",47940978

Prediction and early diagnosis is important to prevent related health complications. The objective is to construct and compare predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using 987 records of Qataris and long-term residents aged 18+ years from Qatar Biobank. Percentages were used to summarize data and chi-square tests to assess associations. Predictive models of hypertension were constructed and compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of algorithms was assessed using accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Stata and Weka were used for analysis. Results Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother’s history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. All algorithms showed more or less similar performances: Random forest (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.4%, sensitivity = 82.1%), logistic regression (accuracy = 81.1%, PPV = 80.1%, sensitivity = 81.1%) and decision tree (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.2%, sensitivity = 82.1%. In terms of AUC, compared to logistic regression, while random forest performed similarly, decision tree had a significantly lower discrimination ability (p-value<0.05) with AUC’s equal to 85.0, 86.9, and 79.9, respectively. Conclusions Machine learning provides the chance of having a rapid predictive model using non-invasive predictors to screen for hypertension. Future research should consider improving the predictive accuracy of models in larger general populations, including more important predictors and using a variety of algorithms.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,15,N/A,2020,2020-10-16 00:00:00,56,67,"Latifa A AlKaabi, Lina S Ahmed, Maryam F Al Attiyah, M.

Chapter 12 concludes the book with some commentary about the scienti c contributions of MTS. The Taguchi method for design of experiment has generated considerable controversy in the statistical community over the past few decades. The MTS/MTGS method seems to lead another source of discussions on the methodology it advocates (Montgomery 2003). As pointed out by Woodall et al. (2003), the MTS/MTGS methods are considered ad hoc in the sense that they have not been developed using any underlying statistical theory. Because the “normal” and “abnormal” groups form the basis of the theory, some sampling restrictions are fundamental to the applications. First, it is essential that the “normal” sample be uniform, unbiased, and/or complete so that a reliable measurement scale is obtained. Second, the selection of “abnormal” samples is crucial to the success of dimensionality reduction when OAs are used. For example, if each abnormal item is really unique in the medical example, then it is unclear how the statistical distance MD can be guaranteed to give a consistent diagnosis measure of severity on a continuous scale when the larger-the-better type S/N ratio is used. Multivariate diagnosis is not new to Technometrics readers and is now becoming increasingly more popular in statistical analysis and data mining for knowledge discovery. As a promising alternative that assumes no underlying data model, The Mahalanobis–Taguchi Strategy does not provide suf cient evidence of gains achieved by using the proposed method over existing tools. Readers may be very interested in a detailed comparison with other diagnostic tools, such as logistic regression and tree-based methods. Overall, although the idea of MTS/MTGS is intriguing, this book would be more valuable had it been written in a rigorous fashion as a technical reference. There is some lack of precision even in several mathematical notations. Perhaps a follow-up with additional theoretical justi cation and careful case studies would answer some of the lingering questions.",Technometrics,journal,['JournalArticle'],ca4b3aef-bda7-47fe-b7e5-4f9cd6cb1947,Technometrics,267 - 268,45,N/A,2003,2003-08-01 00:00:00,17827,7,E.

The functions of RNAs are strongly coupled to their structures or proper structure changes, and RNA structure prediction has been paid much attention in the last two decades. Some computational models have been developed to predict RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures in silico, and these models are generally composed of predicting RNA 3D structure ensemble, evaluating near-native RNAs from the structure ensemble, and refining the identified RNAs.

Here, we report assessments of RNA structure predictions in CASP15, the first CASP exercise that involved RNA structure modeling. Forty two predictor groups submitted models for at least one of twelve RNA-containing targets. These models were evaluated by the RNA-Puzzles organizers and, separately, by a CASP-recruited team using metrics (GDT, lDDT) and approaches (Z-score rankings) initially developed for assessment of proteins and generalized here for RNA assessment. The two assessments independently ranked the same predictor groups as first (AIchemy_RNA2), second (Chen), and third (RNAPolis and GeneSilico, tied); predictions from deep learning approaches were significantly worse than these top ranked groups, which did not use deep learning. Further analyses based on direct comparison of predicted models to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps and X-ray diffraction data support these rankings. With the exception of two RNA-protein complexes, models submitted by CASP15 groups correctly predicted the global fold of the RNA targets. Comparisons of CASP15 submissions to designed RNA nanostructures as well as molecular replacement trials highlight the potential utility of current RNA modeling approaches for RNA nanotechnology and structural biology, respectively. Nevertheless, challenges remain in modeling fine details such as non- canonical pairs, in ranking among submitted models, and in prediction of multiple structures resolved by cryo-EM or crystallography.",bioRxiv,journal,,027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,bioRxiv,,,N/A,2023,2023-04-26 00:00:00,38,84,"Rhiju Das, R.

TinyML is a rapidly growing subfield at the intersection of computer science, software engineering, and machine learning. Building deep learning (DL) networks that are a few hundred KBs in size has been the focus of recent research in this area. Deploying TinyML into small devices makes them smart. Reduced computation, power usage, and response time are just a few of the many advantages of TinyML. In this work, we provide an introduction to TinyML and demonstrate its benefits and architecture. Then, we investigate the meaning of quantization as a standard compression method for TinyML-related applications. There are two methods used to obtain the quantized weights of the deep learning models are quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ), we described them in details. Next, TinyML-based solutions to improve the role of IoT devices in Smart Cities are highlighted as: lightweight training of deep learning models, inference of lightweight deep learning models in IoT devices, low power consumption, and inference of deep learning models in restricted resources of IoT devices. Finally, presenting some use cases for TinyML studies, with these studies applied to several cases in a variety of fields.

This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes Explainable AI (XAI) to improve the interpretability of predictive healthcare models. The proposed system integrates feature importance-based methodologies with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to offer a comprehensive comprehension of the predictive and preventive healthcare recommendations. The framework commences by conducting an in-depth examination of the present condition of Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare sector, as well as the importance of predictive and preventive healthcare. The literature review examines the difficulties related to the comprehensibility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare field and presents feature importance-based approaches and LIME as potential remedies. The focus is on the hybrid approach that combines these techniques, as it has the potential to offer precise predictions while also ensuring a strong level of interpretability. The methodology section delineates the procedure for gathering healthcare data and IoT sensor data, subsequently followed by preprocessing measures such as data cleansing and feature engineering. The predictive models undergo a process of selection, training, and evaluation, with the primary objective of attaining a notable accuracy level of 0.961. This text provides a detailed explanation of how the combination of feature importance-based approaches and LIME improves the transparency and interpretability of the model. An extensive case study is provided to illustrate the implementation of the suggested framework in an actual situation. The results and evaluation section showcases the exceptional precision of 0.961, as well as enhanced interpretability scores and decreased computational time in comparison to the baseline XAI models. The discussion section juxtaposes the suggested hybrid approach with conventional models, examines ethical considerations, and investigates the scalability and generalizability of the framework. To conclude, the paper provides a concise overview of the findings and implications of the Explainable AI-Powered IoT Systems for Predictive and Preventive Healthcare framework. This hybrid approach demonstrates high accuracy, improved interpretability, and efficient computational performance, making it a promising advancement in personalized health management and wellness optimization.

New wearable devices may help people to automatically record energy assumed in their meals. Objective: The present review collects the released articles about wearable devices or method for automatic caloric assessments. Method: A literature research has been performed with PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and ClinicalTrials.gov search engines, considering released articles regarding applications of wearable devices in eating environment, from 2005 onwards. Results: Several tools allow caloric assessment and food registration: wearable devices counting the number of bites ingested by the user, instruments detecting swallows and chewings, methods that analyse food with digital photography. All of them still require more validation and improvement. Conclusion: Automatic recording of caloric intake through wearable devices is a promising method to monitor body weight and eating habits in clinical and non-clinical settings, and the research is still going on.",Open Nursing Journal,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",48e77024-dd63-46b3-b7e6-b3019483f2f8,The Open Nursing Journal,232 - 240,11,N/A,2017,2017-10-31 00:00:00,9,21,"Maria Laura Magrini, Clara Minto, Francesca Lazzarini, M.

Objective The objective of this study was to develop a new method, based on an app for mobile phones called e-EPIDEMIOLOGY, which was designed to collect individual consumption data for a series of foods/drinks, and to compare this app with a previously validated paper food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Methods University students >18 years of age recorded the consumption of certain foods/drinks using e-EPIDEMIOLOGY during 28 consecutive days and then filled out a paper FFQ at the end of the study period. To evaluate the agreement between the categories of habitual consumption for each of the foods/drinks included in the study, cross-classification analysis and a weighted kappa statistic were used. Results A total of 119 participants completed the study (71% female, 85/119; 29% male, 34/119). Cross-classification analysis showed that 79.8% of the participants were correctly classified into the same category and just 1.1% were misclassified into opposite categories. The average weighted kappa statistic was good (κ=.64). Conclusions The results indicate that e-EPIDEMIOLOGY generated ranks of dietary intakes that were highly comparable with the previously validated paper FFQ. However, it was noted that further testing of e-EPIDEMIOLOGY is required to establish its wider utility.",JMIR Research Protocols,journal,['JournalArticle'],278131df-030d-4e6c-b083-d57f3b740dc4,JMIR Research Protocols,,5,N/A,2016,2016-11-02 00:00:00,20,52,"L.

Using this technology, scientists and physicians can observe the entire human genome comprehensively, generating a plethora of new sequencing data. Modern computational analysis entails advanced algorithms for variant detection, as well as complex models for classification. Data science and machine learning play a crucial role in the processing and interpretation of results, using enormous databases and statistics to discover new and support current genotype–phenotype correlations. In clinical practice, this technology has greatly enabled the development of personalized medicine, approaching each patient individually and in accordance with their genetic and biochemical profile. The most propulsive areas include rare disease genomics, oncogenomics, pharmacogenomics, neonatal screening, and infectious disease genomics. Another crucial application of WGS lies in the field of multi-omics, working towards the complete integration of human biomolecular data. Further technological development of sequencing technologies has led to the birth of third and fourth-generation sequencing, which include long-read sequencing, single-cell genomics, and nanopore sequencing. These technologies, alongside their continued implementation into medical research and practice, show great promise for the future of the field of medicine.",Cells,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",51278f27-cfdd-4938-81e4-9d54ca7b3cd0,Cells,,13,N/A,2024,2024-03-01 00:00:00,20,131,"P.

The lack of actual hot-rolled strip defect data sets currently limits further research on the classification of hot-rolled strip defects to some extent. In real production, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm has some difficulties, for example, the algorithm is not particularly accurate in classifying some uncommon defects. Therefore, further research is needed on how to apply deep learning to the actual detection of defects on the surface of hot rolled steel strip. In this paper, we proposed a hot rolled steel strip defect dataset called Xsteel surface defect dataset (X-SDD) which contains seven typical types of hot rolled strip defects with a total of 1360 defect images. Compared with the six defect types of the commonly used NEU surface defect database (NEU-CLS), our proposed X-SDD contains more types. Then, we adopt the newly proposed RepVGG algorithm and combine it with the spatial attention (SA) mechanism to verify the effect on the X-SDD. Finally, we apply multiple algorithms to test on our proposed X-SDD to provide the corresponding benchmarks. The test results show that our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 95.10% on the testset, which exceeds other comparable algorithms by a large margin. Meanwhile, our algorithm achieves the best results in Macro-Precision, Macro-Recall and Macro-F1-score metrics.",Symmetry,journal,['JournalArticle'],1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,706,13,N/A,2021,2021-04-17 00:00:00,98,45,"Xinglong Feng, Xian-wen Gao, Ling Luo","1641383061, 1797939, None",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff8ad53f6591409b3dd1c7947ca32d49ca3dc569,"Computer Science, Engineering, Materials Science",1641383061
ca41132c7a80c07ca516e236dc3bad527e5a9cb1,10.3390/ma14081957,Wavelet Scattering and Neural Networks for Railhead Defect Identification,"Accurate and automatic railhead inspection is crucial for the operational safety of railway systems. Deep learning on visual images is effective in the automatic detection of railhead defects, but either intensive data requirements or ignoring defect sizes reduce its applicability. This paper developed a machine learning framework based on wavelet scattering networks (WSNs) and neural networks (NNs) for identifying railhead defects. WSNs are functionally equivalent to deep convolutional neural networks while containing no parameters, thus suitable for non-intensive datasets. NNs can restore location and size information. The publicly available rail surface discrete defects (RSDD) datasets were analyzed, including 67 Type-I railhead images acquired from express tracks and 128 Type-II images captured from ordinary/heavy haul tracks. The ultimate validation accuracy reached 99.80% and 99.44%, respectively. WSNs can extract implicit signal features, and the support vector machine classifier can improve the learning accuracy of NNs by over 6%. Three criteria, namely the precision, recall, and F-measure, were calculated for comparison with the literature. At the pixel level, the developed approach achieved three criteria of around 90%, outperforming former methods. At the defect level, the recall rates reached 100%, indicating all labeled defects were identified. The precision rates were around 75%, affected by the insignificant misidentified speckles (smaller than 20 pixels). Nonetheless, the developed learning framework was effective in identifying railhead defects.",Materials,journal,['JournalArticle'],0b8373ea-5505-4c96-99ff-b8da87a2ce3e,Materials,,14,N/A,2021,2021-04-01 00:00:00,10,43,Yang Jin,2122755150,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca41132c7a80c07ca516e236dc3bad527e5a9cb1,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2122755150
1f7c5252b1225008916c3c098bd1f17d6025333e,10.3390/MET11030388,Automatic Detection and Classification of Steel Surface Defect Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Automatic detection of steel surface defects is very important for product quality control in the steel industry. However, the traditional method cannot be well applied in the production line, because of its low accuracy and slow running speed. The current, popular algorithm (based on deep learning) also has the problem of low accuracy, and there is still a lot of room for improvement. This paper proposes a method combining improved ResNet50 and enhanced faster region convolutional neural networks (faster R-CNN) to reduce the average running time and improve the accuracy. Firstly, the image input into the improved ResNet50 model, which add the deformable revolution network (DCN) and improved cutout to classify the sample with defects and without defects. If the probability of having a defect is less than 0.3, the algorithm directly outputs the sample without defects. Otherwise, the samples are further input into the improved faster R-CNN, which adds spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), enhanced feature pyramid networks (FPN), and matrix NMS.

However, it is difficult to visually analyze ECG signals due to their complexity and nonlinearity. The wavelet scattering transform can generate translation-invariant and deformation-stable representations of ECG signals through cascades of wavelet convolutions with nonlinear modulus and averaging operators. We proposed a novel approach using wavelet scattering transform to automatically classify four categories of arrhythmia ECG heartbeats, namely, nonectopic (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V), and fusion (F) beats. In this study, the wavelet scattering transform extracted 8 time windows from each ECG heartbeat. Two dimensionality reduction methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and time window selection, were applied on the 8 time windows. These processed features were fed to the neural network (NN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifiers for classification. The 4th time window in combination with KNN (k = 4) has achieved the optimal performance with an averaged accuracy, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.3%, 99.6%, 99.5%, and 98.8%, respectively, using tenfold cross-validation. Thus, our proposed model is capable of highly accurate arrhythmia classification and will provide assistance to physicians in ECG interpretation.",Comput. Math.

This work aims to develop and pilot a methodology to help decision makers target and prioritize sampling investigations and identify contaminated natural resources. Here we use random forest models to predict ∑PFAS in fish tissue; understanding PFAS levels in fish is particularly important in the CRB because fish can be a major component of tribal and indigenous people diet. Geospatial data, including land cover and distances to known or potential PFAS sources and industries, were leveraged as predictors for modeling. Models were developed and evaluated for Washington state and Oregon using limited available empirical data. Mapped predictions show several areas where detectable concentrations of PFAS in fish tissue are predicted to occur, but prior sampling has not yet confirmed. Variable importance is analyzed to identify potentially important sources of PFAS in fish in this region. The cost-effective methodologies demonstrated here can help address sparsity of existing PFAS occurrence data in environmental media in this and other regions while also giving insights into potentially important drivers and sources of PFAS in fish.",Environmental Science and Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],9efb20cf-7484-450d-8245-12dfbf639d3e,Environmental Science & Technology,14024 - 14035,57,N/A,2023,2023-09-05 00:00:00,10,29,"N.

The annual revenue generated by fraud exceeds $1 trillion. Even while fraud is dangerous for organizations, it may be uncovered with the help of intelligent solutions such as rules engines and machine learning. In this research, we introduce a unique hybrid technique for identifying financial payment fraud by combining nature-inspired-based Hyperparameter tuning with several supervised classifier models, as implemented in a modified version of the XGBoost Algorithm. At the outset, we split out a sample of the full financial payment dataset to use as a test set. We use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. Records that are known to be illegitimate or fraudulent are predicted, while those that raise suspicion are further investigated using a number of machine learning algorithms. The models are trained and validated using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. Several tests using a dataset of actual financial transactions are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2022,2022-12-09 00:00:00,17,53,"Surjeet Dalal, Bijeta Seth, M.

The inclusion of such attributes makes analysis harder, due to results with poorer generalization and higher resource usage. A common practice is, therefore, to ignore such attributes, removing them, albeit wasting the information they provided. Contrariwise, this paper reports our findings on the positive impacts of using high-cardinality attributes on credit card fraud detection. Thus, we present a new algorithm for domain reduction that preserves the fraud-detection capabilities. Experiments applying a deep feedforward neural network on real datasets from a major Brazilian financial institution have shown that, when measured by the F-1 metric, the inclusion of such attributes does improve fraud-detection quality. As a main contribution, this proposed algorithm was able to reduce attribute cardinality, improving the training times of a model while preserving its predictive capabilities.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2022,2022-10-15 00:00:00,6,56,"E.

To detect crimes such as credit card fraud, several single and hybrid machine learning approaches have been used. However, these approaches have significant limitations as no further investigation on different hybrid algorithms for a given dataset were studied. This research proposes and investigates seven hybrid machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities with a real word dataset. The developed hybrid models consisted of two phases, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms were used first to detect credit card fraud, then, hybrid methods were constructed based on the best single algorithm from the first phase. Our findings indicated that the hybrid model Adaboost + LGBM is the champion model as it displayed the highest performance.

Deep learning has been widely applied in medical imaging to help automate and improve medical image analysis. Medical imaging techniques such as MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays produce large amounts of data that can be difficult for human experts to accurately interpret and analyze. Deep learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns in medical images, identify abnormal features, and make predictions about patient outcomes. The present research work exposes an automatic classification model to detect brain tumors in brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). The data set is found in the Kaggle repository, which consists of 253 MRI images: 155 with brain tumors and 98 without. The proposed model can classify brain tumor MRI images with 91% accuracy. Therefore, the model represents an auxiliary tool to existing conventional methods for the diagnosis of brain tumors.",International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning,journal,['JournalArticle'],4f80dbcd-1873-4e18-8fd1-099686d82278,International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning,,,N/A,2023,2023-11-10 00:00:00,54,0,"Omar Villalpando-Vargas, Aron Hernández-Trinidad, T.

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,13,N/A,2018,2018-03-27 00:00:00,989,90,"Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, Vassilios Assimakopoulos","2276105, 2146553, 90170330",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6b3aeb29b5b4034d84598424b1edfb29acf2a6c,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Medicine",2276105

However, in the big data environment, the ELM based on the Moore–Penrose matrix inverse still suffers from excessive calculation loads. Leveraging the decomposability of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a convex model-fitting problem can be split into a set of sub-problems which can be executed in parallel. Using a maximally splitting technique and a relaxation technique, the sub-problems can be split into multiple univariate sub-problems. On this basis, we propose an adaptive parameter selection method that automatically tunes the key algorithm parameters during training. To confirm the effectiveness of this algorithm, experiments are conducted on eight classification datasets. We have verified the effectiveness of this algorithm in terms of the number of iterations, computation time, and acceleration ratios. The results show that the method proposed by this paper can greatly improve the speed of data processing while increasing the parallelism.",Mathematics,,['JournalArticle'],6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-07-21 00:00:00,4,40,"Zhangquan Wang, Shanshan Huo, Xinlong Xiong, Ke Wang, Banteng Liu","2108404908, 6790096, 2224755388, 2208444356, 3330131",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa3eac354d4a22ae12451148e33e774bdb37aebc,"Computer Science, Mathematics",2108404908

This paper explores the integration of the Network Slice Controller (NSC) in an IBN context further enhances network management by enabling scalable resource requests, outsourcing resource evaluation, and modular operation of intent processing. However, challenges such as addressing the knapsack problem, obtaining sufficient network information without compromising privacy, and optimizing the process without counterproductive overloads need to be tackled. Overall, IBN holds immense potential in revolutionizing network management in the 5G/6G era, paving the way for personalized and efficient connectivity, and the Network Slice Controller can be a key feature to facilitate the integration of IBN with 5G/6G network controllers.",International Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture,conference,"['Book', 'JournalArticle']",b251b5b7-ceed-428c-9e33-d1b41d4d1cb6,Proceedings of the 18th Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture,,,396,2023,2023-10-02 00:00:00,3,3,"Alejandro Muñiz Da Costa, Luis M.

Design Prospective feasibility study. Setting The study was conducted in a university setting and participants’ homes. Participants Thirty-five volunteers ≥55 years old were recruited. Intervention Participants were asked to follow a balance exercise programme 7 days a week for 3 weeks using a phone application. Seventeen participants trained for a further 3 weeks. Outcome measures Postural sway measures during quiet standing with feet at shoulder width apart and feet together, one leg standing and tandem stance were measured at baseline, and at the end of the 3 and 6 training weeks; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) assessed participants’ physical activity level before training; and app acceptability was recorded using a user experience questionnaire. Results Participants on the 3 and 6-week programme on average completed 20 (±5) and 38 (±11) days of training, respectively, and all scored moderate to high on the IPAQ. Between baseline and the 3-week assessments, statistically significant improvements were observed for anteroposterior sway, mediolateral sway, sway area during tandem stance, for anteroposterior sway during one leg standing and for sway area during feet together stance. Improvements were observed at 6 week compared with baseline but those between 3 and 6 weeks were not significant. Based on the questionnaire, participants reported that the app is an appropriate tool for balance training (77%), they reported benefits from the training (50%) and found it easy to fit it into daily routine (88%). Conclusion The high level of adherence and improvements observed in the analysed measures demonstrate the feasibility of using an app to train balance in moderately to highly physically active older participants. This demonstrates that given appropriate tools the older population is positive towards and receptive of digital interventions aimed to improve balance.",BMJ Open,journal,['JournalArticle'],e6216b43-2428-4aaf-8101-b40e1dfd2810,BMJ Open,,10,N/A,2020,2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,50,"E.

As a result, it is crucial for companies to implement robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive data from intrusion, which can lead to significant financial losses. Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) require further enhancements to reduce false positives as well as enhance overall accuracy. To minimize security risks, data analytics and machine learning can be utilized to create data-driven recommendations and decisions based on the input data. This study focuses on developing machine learning models that can identify cyber-attacks and enhance IDS system performance. This paper employed logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest algorithms on the UNSW-NB15 network traffic dataset, utilizing in-depth exploratory data analysis, and feature selection using correlation analysis and random sampling to compare model accuracy and effectiveness. The performance and confusion matrix results indicate that the Random Forest model is the best option for identifying cyber-attacks, with a remarkable F1 score of 97.80%, accuracy of 98.63%, and low false alarm rate of 1.36%, and thus should be considered to improve IDS system security.",Algorithms,journal,['JournalArticle'],e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,64,17,N/A,2024,2024-02-01 00:00:00,18,28,"Shweta More, Moad Idrissi, Haitham H.

A codebook of 198 variables related to different aspects of pre‐attack behavior is applied to a sample of 55 lone actor terrorists. Data were drawn from open‐source materials and complemented where possible with primary sources. Most lone actors are not highly lethal or surreptitious attackers. They are generally poor at maintaining operational security, leak their motivations and capabilities in numerous ways, and generally do so months and even years before an attack. Moreover, the “loneness” thought to define this type of terrorism is generally absent; most lone actors uphold social ties that are crucial to their adoption and maintenance of the motivation and capability to commit terrorist violence. The results offer concrete input for those working to detect and prevent this form of terrorism and argue for a re‐evaluation of the “lone actor” concept.",Journal of Forensic Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],632c6d05-019f-4296-8a4e-842e860ae5ca,Journal of Forensic Sciences,,63,N/A,2018,2018-07-01 00:00:00,89,129,"B.

These anomalies include narrow cell mini-columns and variable neuron density. However, difficulty obtaining sufficient post-mortem samples has often prevented investigations from converging on reproducible measures. Recent advances in processing magnetic resonance diffusion weighted images (DWI) make in vivo characterization of neuronal cytoarchitecture a potential alternative to post-mortem studies. Using extensive DWI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmentsm (ABCD®) study 142 individuals with an Autism diagnosis were compared with 8971 controls using a restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) framework that characterized total neurite density (TND), its component restricted normalized directional diffusion (RND), and restricted normalized isotropic diffusion (RNI). A significant decrease in TND was observed in Autism in the right cerebellar cortex (β=-0.005, SE =0.0015, p=0.0267), with significant decreases in RNI and significant increases in RND found diffusely throughout posterior and anterior aspects of the brain, respectively. Furthermore, these regions remained significant in post-hoc analysis when the ASD sample was compared against a subset of 1404 individuals with other psychiatric conditions (pulled from the original 8971). These findings highlight the importance of characterizing neuron cytoarchitecture in Autism and the significance of their incorporation as physiological covariates in future studies. Lay abstract Children with autism have differences in neuron structure unique from the general population and populations with attention, anxiety, and depression disorders. Brain imaging data on over 11,000 children was acquired at ages 9 and 11 years-of-age. Estimates of neuron density were derived from brain imaging data using recently validated techniques and comparative groups were composed using parent reported diagnosis of autism and other common psychiatric disorders. Consistent macro-structural changes in brain have been difficult to replicate and micro-structural changes have been historically difficult to acquire with other methodologies. We identified regional differences in the density of neuron cell bodies, neuron branching, and total neuron density in those with a reported diagnosis of ASD. Findings were consistent when compared against those with other psychiatric disorders in post-hoc analysis. These findings demonstrate the viability and importance of investigating in vivo changes to neurons in those with autism to advance our current understanding of related physiology.",bioRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,bioRxiv,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-26 00:00:00,3,86,"Z.

dd131d2937b46e2790ff67241886e8be9efcce38,10.1155/2022/8598305,PAS: Performance-Aware Job Scheduling for Big Data Processing Systems,"Big data analytics has become increasingly vital in many modern enterprise applications such as user profiling and business process optimization. Today’s big data processing systems, such as Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Hive, treat big data applications as a batch of jobs for scheduling. Existing schedulers in production systems often maintain fair allocation without considering application performance and resource utilization simultaneously. It is challenging to perform job scheduling in big data systems to achieve both low turnaround time and high resource utilization due to the high complexity in data processing logics and the dynamic variation in workloads. In this article, we propose a performance-aware scheduler, referred to as PAS, which dynamically schedules big data jobs in Hadoop YARN and Spark and autonomously adjusts scheduling policies to improve application performance and resource utilization. Specifically, PAS schedules multiple concurrent jobs using different policies based on the predicted job completion time and employs a greedy approach and a one-step lookahead strategy to opportunistically maximize the average job performance while still maintaining a satisfactory level of resource utilization. We implement PAS in Hadoop YARN and evaluate its performance with HiBench, a well-known big data processing benchmark. Experimental results show that PAS reduces the average turnaround time by 25% and the makespan by 15% in comparison with four state-of-the-art schedulers.",Security and Communication Networks,journal,,02a4454a-84c8-471c-9b40-cc045d4f3223,Security and Communication Networks,,,N/A,2022,2022-04-12 00:00:00,5,44,"Yiren Li, Tieke Li, Pei Shen, Liang Hao, Jin Yang, Zhengtong Zhang, Junhao Chen, Liang Bao","2111149533, 1778777, 2149290130, 2162376257, 2157358539, 2162412589, 2115267766, 2103958254",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd131d2937b46e2790ff67241886e8be9efcce38,"Computer Science, Engineering",2111149533

In recent years, attention has increasingly been paid to human resources (HR), since worker quality and skills represent a growth factor and a real competitive advantage for companies. After having been introduced to sales and marketing departments, artificial intelligence is also starting to guide employee-related decisions within HR management. The purpose is to support decisions that are based not on subjective aspects but on objective data analysis. The goal of this work is to analyse how objective factors influence employee attrition, in order to identify the main causes that contribute to a worker’s decision to leave a company, and to be able to predict whether a particular employee will leave the company. After the training, the obtained model for the prediction of employees’ attrition is tested on a real dataset provided by IBM analytics, which includes 35 features and about 1500 samples. Results are expressed in terms of classical metrics and the algorithm that produced the best results for the available dataset is the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. It reveals the best recall rate (0.54), since it measures the ability of a classifier to find all the positive instances and achieves an overall false negative rate equal to 4.5% of the total observations.",De Computis,,['JournalArticle'],38e26272-f1d7-470a-a99f-0b5884c9df6e,Comput.,86,9,Unknown,2020,2020-11-03 00:00:00,132,40,"Francesca Fallucchi, Marco Coladangelo, R.

As the information that is currently available is fragmented, it is difficult for organizations to understand what it takes to execute people analytics successfully.Design/methodology/approachTo identify the key ingredients, a narrative literature review was conducted using both traditional people analytics and broader business intelligence literature. The findings were summarized in the People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel.FindingsThe People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel identifies four categories of ingredients that a people analytics team requires to be effective. These are enabling resources, products, stakeholder management and governance structure. Under each category, multiple sub-themes are discussed, such as data and infrastructure; senior management support; and knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics (KSAOs) (enablers).Practical implicationsMany organizations are still trying to set up their people analytics teams, and many others are struggling to improve decision-making by using people analytics. For these companies, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current literature and describes what it takes to contribute to organizational performance using people analytics.Originality/valueThis paper is designed to provide organizations and researchers with a comprehensive understanding of what it takes to execute people analytics successfully. By using the People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel as a guideline, scholars are now better equipped to research the processes that are required for the ingredients to be truly effective.",Journal of Organizational Effectiveness,journal,['Review'],39064304-da8e-445f-a4e3-8ff393df245f,Journal of Organizational Effectiveness: People and Performance,,,N/A,2020,2020-06-01 00:00:00,59,40,"T.

New terms are coined to summarize new developments, often with several interpretations and without a formal definition. The term Smart Education has been coined to represent a move forward in technology-enhanced education, but what is behind it? Does it represent something essentially different from the educational technologies used before? In this paper, we do a systematic literature review to understand how this term is used, what the technologies behind it are, and what promises are made. We conclude that although the term is fuzzy, there are indeed several developments available today that can make educational technologies much more adapted to the learner and therefore underpin the learning in a smarter way.",International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Ambient Intelligence,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",05878603-c240-4a32-b893-eda8d45febb4,,57,,396,2019,2019-11-21 00:00:00,36,57,"Adrián Martín, Carlos Alario-Hoyos, C.

Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black‐box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use‐case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system",WIREs Data Mining Knowl.

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder‐Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",41bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,,1724-1734,,396,2014,2014-06-03 00:00:00,22563,33,"Kyunghyun Cho, B.

Key challenges include how to shorten transmission delays and increase the stability of transmissions. When establishing routing paths, most research focuses on detecting traffic and selecting roads with higher vehicle densities in order to transmit packets, thus avoiding carry-and-forward scenarios and decreasing transmission delays; however, such approaches may not obtain accurate real-time traffic densities by periodically monitoring each road because vehicle densities change so rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel routing information system called the machine learning-assisted route selection (MARS) system to estimate necessary information for routing protocols. In MARS, road information is maintained in roadside units with the help of machine learning. We use machine learning to predict the moves of vehicles and then choose some suitable routing paths with better transmission capacity to transmit packets. Further, MARS can help to decide the forwarding direction between two RSUs according to the predicted location of the destination and the estimated transmission delays in both forwarding directions. Our proposed system can provide in-time routing information for VANETs and greatly enhance network performance.",Int. J. Distributed Sens.

This study was conducted to compare the differences of sleep disorders in vestibular migraine (VM) patients and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patients. Methods: VM patients, BPPV patients, and healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Pittsburgh sleep quality index and polysomnography monitoring were used as subjective and objective, respectively, evaluation methods to evaluate the sleep quality of participants in the latest month. Results: Fifty-seven BPPV patients, 48 VM patients, and 42 HCs were included in this study. There were 79.16% VM patients, 54.39% BPPV patients, and 14.28% HCs with sleep disorders. The difference in the incidence rate of sleep disorders was significant between VM patients and BPPV patients (p = 0.008) and significantly higher in both the VM group (p < 0.00001) and BPPV group (p = 0.00004) than in the HC groups (14.28%). Compared with BPPV patients, the VM patients had the significantly lower sleep efficiency (p < 0.001) and N3 (p < 0.001) and the significantly higher time of wake-up after sleep onset (p < 0.001), N1 (p < 0.001), and N2 (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the VM patients had significantly higher incidence rates of severe obstructive sleep apnea hypoventilation syndrome (p = 0.001) and periodic leg movement in sleep (p = 0.016). Conclusion: The incidence rate of sleep disorders was significantly higher in both VM and BPPV patients than in the HC groups. To improve the curative effects, clinicians should pay more attention to the comorbidity of sleep disorders in treating VM and BPPV.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,journal,['JournalArticle'],07931092-9002-4e9f-a62d-00af30be540f,Frontiers in Psychiatry,,12,N/A,2021,2021-11-18 00:00:00,13,54,"Hui Xue, Baojun Wang, Tianyu Meng, Shijun Zhao, Qingyin Wang, Xin Zhang, Min-Sung Kang, Wen-ping Xiang","2053313222, 2156645062, 151234498, 2110773073, 2142378459, 2149172322, 2111622351, 1786324",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a4edf0c77f3c41910a8269abaa805a517cfc5b6,Medicine,2053313222

To this end, we build base-ml, a comprehensive MVA/ML software tool, and applied it to three increasingly difficult clinical objectives in differentiation of common vestibular disorders, using data from a large prospective clinical patient registry (DizzyReg). Methods: Base-ml features a full MVA/ML pipeline for classification of multimodal patient data, comprising tools for data loading and pre-processing; a stringent scheme for nested and stratified cross-validation including hyper-parameter optimization; a set of 11 classifiers, ranging from commonly used algorithms like logistic regression and random forests, to artificial neural network models, including a graph-based deep learning model which we recently proposed; a multi-faceted evaluation of classification metrics; tools from the domain of “Explainable AI” that illustrate the input distribution and a statistical analysis of the most important features identified by multiple classifiers. Results: In the first clinical task, classification of the bilateral vestibular failure (N = 66) vs. functional dizziness (N = 346) was possible with a classification accuracy ranging up to 92.5% (Random Forest). In the second task, primary functional dizziness (N = 151) vs. secondary functional dizziness (following an organic vestibular syndrome) (N = 204), was classifiable with an accuracy ranging from 56.5 to 64.2% (k-nearest neighbors/logistic regression). The third task compared four episodic disorders, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (N = 134), vestibular paroxysmia (N = 49), Menière disease (N = 142) and vestibular migraine (N = 215). Classification accuracy ranged between 25.9 and 50.4% (Naïve Bayes/Support Vector Machine). Recent (graph-) deep learning models classified well in all three tasks, but not significantly better than more traditional ML methods. Classifiers reliably identified clinically relevant features as most important toward classification. Conclusion: The three clinical tasks yielded classification results that correlate with the clinical intuition regarding the difficulty of diagnosis. It is favorable to apply an array of MVA/ML algorithms rather than a single one, to avoid under-estimation of classification accuracy. Base-ml provides a systematic benchmarking of classifiers, with a standardized output of MVA/ML performance on clinical tasks. To alleviate re-implementation efforts, we provide base-ml as an open-source tool for the community.",Frontiers in Neurology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3513ce18-3757-4358-b15f-7060af98e6d0,Frontiers in Neurology,,12,N/A,2021,2021-08-02 00:00:00,8,70,"G.

Intrinsic variability between cells, caused by manufacturing differences, occurs at all stages of life and increases with age. Researchers need to know the minimum number of cells they should test to give an accurate representation of population variability, since testing many cells is expensive. In this paper, empirical capacity versus time ageing models were fitted to various degradation datasets assuming that the model parameters could be drawn from a distribution describing a larger population. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we estimated the number of cells required to be tested. Depending on the complexity of the ageing model, models with 1, 2 or 3 parameters respectively required data from at least 9, 11 or 13 cells for a consistent fit. This implies that researchers will need to test at least these numbers of cells at each test point in their experiment to capture manufacturing variability.",Batteries & Supercaps,,,008fc754-9ac0-4397-a17a-0c1601b6f913,Batteries & Supercaps,,,Unknown,2021,2021-07-04 00:00:00,21,45,"Philipp Dechent, Samuel Greenbank, Felix Hildenbrand, Saad Jbabdi, Dirk Uwe Sauer, D.

An analysis of English road fatality data, incorporating gender and road type","Background Most analysis of road injuries examines the risk experienced by people using different modes of transport, for instance, pedestrian fatalities per-head or per-km. A small but growing field analyses the impact that the use of different transport modes has on other road users, for instance, injuries to others per-km driven. Methods This paper moves the analysis of risk posed to others forward by comparing six different vehicular modes, separating road types (major vs minor roads in urban vs rural settings). The comparison of risk posed by men and women for all these modes is also novel. Results Per-vehicle kilometre, buses and lorries pose much the highest risk to others, while cycles pose the lowest. Motorcycles pose a substantially higher per-km risk to others than cars. The fatality risk posed by cars or vans to ORUs per km is higher in rural areas. Risk posed is generally higher on major roads, although not in the case of lorries, suggesting a link to higher speeds. Men pose higher per-km risk to others than women for all modes except buses, as well as being over-represented among users of the most dangerous vehicles. Conclusions Future research should examine more settings, adjust for spatial and temporal confounders, or examine how infrastructure or route characteristics affect risk posed to others. Although for most victims the other vehicle involved is a car, results suggest policy-makers should also seek to reduce disproportionate risks posed by the more dangerous vehicles, for instance, by discouraging motorcycling. Finally, given higher risk posed to others by men across five of six modes analysed, policy-makers should consider how to reduce persistent large gender imbalances in jobs involving driving.",Injury Prevention,journal,['JournalArticle'],dc811d66-51f0-49c7-a652-62e4da8433a3,Injury Prevention,71 - 76,27,N/A,2020,2020-03-30 00:00:00,20,19,"R.

By analyzing the synergies between gender inequality (as a problem), and lack of sustainability (another problem), there is a potential to create an understanding of how these problems are linked. Our aim is to better understand how gendered norms find expression in transport policy and planning. Taking a starting point in gender studies we advance four ideal types on masculine and feminine norms and relate them to sustainability in transport. We advance a methodology for studying gender norms in relation to sustainability in terms of how they are expressed in the text. We contribute to a deeper understanding of transportation related to men and masculinity studies, and advance work by masculinity scholars to include sustainability in transportation issues. Through text analysis, we demonstrate empirically how four Swedish municipalities have developed their (sustainable) transport policies 2014–2018. Our results indicate that the level of sustainability, in plans and strategies, are related to the presence of diverse masculine and feminine norms rather than male and female bodies.",,Unknown,,Unknown,NORMA,128 - 144,15,Unknown,2020,2020-01-30 00:00:00,16,63,"Annica Kronsell, Christian Dymén, L.

Driven by modern deep-learning approaches, RootNav 2.0 replaces previously manual and semi-automatic feature extraction with an extremely deep multi-task Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The network has been designed to explicitly combine local pixel information with global scene information in order to accurately segment small root features across high-resolution images. In addition, the network simultaneously locates seeds, and first and second order root tips to drive a search algorithm seeking optimal paths throughout the image, extracting accurate architectures without user interaction. The proposed method is evaluated on images of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from a seedling assay. The results are compared with semi-automatic analysis via the original RootNav tool, demonstrating comparable accuracy, with a 10-fold increase in speed. We then demonstrate the ability of the network to adapt to different plant species via transfer learning, offering similar accuracy when transferred to an Arabidopsis thaliana plate assay. We transfer for a final time to images of Brassica napus from a hydroponic assay, and still demonstrate good accuracy despite many fewer training images.

One of the key factors is cloudiness, which can be presented not only as a percentage of the sky area covered by clouds but also many additional parameters, such as the type of clouds, the distribution of clouds across atmospheric layers, and their height. The use of machine learning algorithms to forecast the generation of solar power plants requires retrospective data over a long period and formalising the features; however, retrospective data with detailed information about cloudiness are normally recorded in the natural language format. This paper proposes an algorithm for processing such records to convert them into a binary feature vector. Experiments conducted on data from a real solar power plant showed that this algorithm increases the accuracy of short-term solar irradiance forecasts by 5–15%, depending on the quality metric used. At the same time, adding features makes the model less transparent to the user, which is a significant drawback from the point of view of explainable artificial intelligence. Therefore, the paper uses an additive explanation algorithm based on the Shapley vector to interpret the model’s output. It is shown that this approach allows the machine learning model to explain why it generates a particular forecast, which will provide a greater level of trust in intelligent information systems in the power industry.",Algorithms,journal,['JournalArticle'],e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,150,17,N/A,2024,2024-04-02 00:00:00,6,31,"P.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop and improve methods for forecasting of the power plants generation using the energy of the sun, wind and water flows. One of the ways to improve the accuracy of forecast models is a deep analysis of meteorological conditions as the main factor affecting the power generation. In this paper, a method for adapting of forecast models to the meteorological conditions of photovoltaic stations operation based on machine learning algorithms was proposed and studied. In this case, unsupervised learning is first performed using the k-means method to form clusters. For this, it is also proposed to use studied the feature space dimensionality reduction algorithm to visualize and estimate the clustering accuracy. Then, for each cluster, its own machine learning model was trained for generation forecasting and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm was built to attribute the current conditions at the model operation stage to one of the formed clusters. The study was conducted on hourly meteorological data for the period from 1985 to 2021. A feature of the approach is the clustering of weather conditions on hourly rather than daily intervals. As a result, the mean absolute percentage error of forecasting is reduced significantly, depending on the prediction model used. For the best case, the error in forecasting of a photovoltaic plant generation an hour ahead was 9 %.",ENERGETIKA.

One such requirement is the installed capacity utilization factor, which is extremely important for optimally placing power facilities based on renewable energy sources and for the successful development of renewable energy. Efficient placement maximizes the installed capacity utilization factor of a power facility, increasing energy efficiency and the payback period. The installed capacity utilization factor depends on the assumed meteorological factors relating to geographical location and the technical characteristics of power generation. However, the installed capacity utilization factor cannot be accurately predicted, since it is necessary to know the volume of electricity produced by the power facility. A novel approach to the optimization of placement of renewable energy source power plants and their capacity factor forecasting was proposed in this article. This approach combines a machine learning forecasting algorithm (random forest regressor) with a metaheuristic optimization algorithm (grey wolf optimizer). Although the proposed approach assumes the use of only open-source data, the simulations show better results than commonly used algorithms, such as random search, particle swarm optimizer, and firefly algorithm.",Mathematics,,['JournalArticle'],6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,5,44,"A.

The aim of this study was to perform a broad-ranging scientometric analysis to evaluate key themes and trends over the past decades, informing future lines of research. We searched the Web of Science Core Collection from inception until December 7, 2021, using the appropriate search terms such as “physical activity” or “mental health,” with no limitation of language or time. Eligible studies were articles, reviews, editorial material, and proceeding papers. We retrieved 55,353 documents published between 1905 and 2021. The annual scientific production is exponential with a mean annual growth rate of 6.8% since 1989. The 1988–2021 co-cited reference network identified 50 distinct clusters that presented significant modularity and silhouette scores indicating highly credible clusters (Q = 0.848, S = 0.939). This network identified 6 major research trends on physical activity, namely cardiovascular diseases, somatic disorders, cognitive decline/dementia, mental illness, athletes' performance, related health issues, and eating disorders, and the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus on the latest research trends found that greenness/urbanicity (2014), concussion/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (2015), and COVID-19 (2019) were the most active clusters of research. The USA research network was the most central, and the Chinese research network, although important in size, was relatively isolated.

A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect aberrant traffic behavior that firewalls cannot detect. In IDSs, dimension reduction using the feature selection strategy has been shown to be more efficient. By reducing the data dimension and eliminating irrelevant and noisy data, several bio-inspired algorithms have been employed to improve the performance of an IDS. This paper discusses a modified bio-inspired algorithm, which is the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), that enhances the efficacy of the IDS in detecting both normal and anomalous traffic in the network. The main improvements cover the smart initialization phase that combines the filter and wrapper approaches to ensure that the informative features will be included in early iterations. In addition, we adopted a high-speed classification method, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and used the modified GWO to tune the ELM’s parameters. The proposed technique was tested against various meta-heuristic algorithms using the UNSWNB-15 dataset. Because the generic attack is the most common attack type in the dataset, the primary goal of this paper was to detect generic attacks in network traffic. The proposed model outperformed other methods in minimizing the crossover error rate and false positive rate to less than 30%. Furthermore, it obtained the best results with 81%, 78%, and 84% for the accuracy, F1-score, and G-mean measures, respectively.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2022,2022-03-21 00:00:00,72,62,"Abdullah Alzaqebah, Ibrahim Aljarah, Omar Sultan Al-Kadi, R.

Contributing factors are elements in the healthcare process (eg, communication failures) that instigate an event or allow an event to occur. Contributing factors can be used to further investigate why safety events occurred. Methods We used 10 years of self-reported PSE reports from a multihospital healthcare system in the USA. Reports were first selected by event date. We calculated χ2 values for each ngram in the bag-of-words then selected N ngrams with the highest χ2 values. Then, PSE reports were filtered to only include the sentences containing the selected ngrams. Such sentences were called information-rich sentences. We compared two feature extraction techniques from free-text data: (1) baseline bag-of-words features and (2) features from information-rich sentences. Three machine learning algorithms were used to categorise five contributing factors representing sociotechnical errors: communication/hand-off failure, technology issue, policy/procedure issue, distractions/interruptions and lapse/slip. We trained 15 binary classifiers (five contributing factors * three machine learning models). The models’ performances were evaluated according to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), precision, recall, and F1-score. Results Applying the information-rich sentence selection algorithm boosted the contributing factor categorisation performance. Comparing the AUPRCs, the proposed NLP approach improved the categorisation performance of two and achieved comparable results with baseline in categorising three contributing factors. Conclusions Information-rich sentence selection can be incorporated to extract the sentences in free-text event narratives in which the contributing factor information is embedded.",BMJ Health & Care Informatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],88b9565b-577a-44e3-b26e-84ad5f1598a2,BMJ Health & Care Informatics,,30,N/A,2023,2023-05-01 00:00:00,7,41,"A.

d0e262c94a0415fda724aa91d6f60c627ddd0519,10.2196/43014,Extracting Medical Information From Free-Text and Unstructured Patient-Generated Health Data Using Natural Language Processing Methods: Feasibility Study With Real-world Data,"Background Patient-generated health data (PGHD) captured via smart devices or digital health technologies can reflect an individual health journey. PGHD enables tracking and monitoring of personal health conditions, symptoms, and medications out of the clinic, which is crucial for self-care and shared clinical decisions. In addition to self-reported measures and structured PGHD (eg, self-screening, sensor-based biometric data), free-text and unstructured PGHD (eg, patient care note, medical diary) can provide a broader view of a patient’s journey and health condition. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process and analyze unstructured data to create meaningful summaries and insights, showing promise to improve the utilization of PGHD. Objective Our aim is to understand and demonstrate the feasibility of an NLP pipeline to extract medication and symptom information from real-world patient and caregiver data. Methods We report a secondary data analysis, using a data set collected from 24 parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who were recruited via a nonrandom sampling approach. Participants used a voice-interactive app for 2 weeks, generating free-text patient notes (audio transcription or text entry). We built an NLP pipeline using a zero-shot approach (adaptive to low-resource settings). We used named entity recognition (NER) and medical ontologies (RXNorm and SNOMED CT [Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms]) to identify medication and symptoms. Sentence-level dependency parse trees and part-of-speech tags were used to extract additional entity information using the syntactic properties of a note. We assessed the data; evaluated the pipeline with the patient notes; and reported the precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results In total, 87 patient notes are included (audio transcriptions n=78 and text entries n=9) from 24 parents who have at least one CSHCN. The participants were between the ages of 26 and 59 years. The majority were White (n=22, 92%), had more than one child (n=16, 67%), lived in Ohio (n=22, 92%), had mid- or upper-mid household income (n=15, 62.5%), and had higher level education (n=24, 58%). Out of 87 notes, 30 were drug and medication related, and 46 were symptom related. We captured medication instances (medication, unit, quantity, and date) and symptoms satisfactorily (precision >0.65, recall >0.77, F1>0.72). These results indicate the potential when using NER and dependency parsing through an NLP pipeline on information extraction from unstructured PGHD. Conclusions The proposed NLP pipeline was found to be feasible for use with real-world unstructured PGHD to accomplish medication and symptom extraction. Unstructured PGHD can be leveraged to inform clinical decision-making, remote monitoring, and self-care including medical adherence and chronic disease management. With customizable information extraction methods using NER and medical ontologies, NLP models can feasibly extract a broad range of clinical information from unstructured PGHD in low-resource settings (eg, a limited number of patient notes or training data).",JMIR Formative Research,,['JournalArticle'],6c3e705d-29b5-462c-9a3a-6c7877b74a18,JMIR Formative Research,,7,Unknown,2022,2022-09-27 00:00:00,23,52,"Emre Sezgin, Syed-Amad A.

In the 2019 update, WebGestalt supports 12 organisms, 342 gene identifiers and 155 175 functional categories, as well as user-uploaded functional databases. To address the growing and unique need for phosphoproteomics data interpretation, we have implemented phosphosite set analysis to identify important kinases from phosphoproteomics data. We have completely redesigned result visualizations and user interfaces to improve user-friendliness and to provide multiple types of interactive and publication-ready figures. To facilitate comprehension of the enrichment results, we have implemented two methods to reduce redundancy between enriched gene sets. We introduced a web API for other applications to get data programmatically from the WebGestalt server or pass data to WebGestalt for analysis. We also wrapped the core computation into an R package called WebGestaltR for users to perform analysis locally or in third party workflows.

These are benefited by the automation of many processes involved in usual students’ activities which handle massive volumes of data collected from software tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, analyzing and processing these data carefully can give us useful information about the students’ knowledge and the relationship between them and the academic tasks. This information is the source that feeds promising algorithms and methods able to predict students’ performance. In this study, almost 70 papers were analyzed to show different modern techniques widely applied for predicting students’ performance, together with the objectives they must reach in this field. These techniques and methods, which pertain to the area of Artificial Intelligence, are mainly Machine Learning, Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Neural Networks, among others.",Applied Sciences,journal,['Review'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2020,2020-02-04 00:00:00,228,68,"Juan L.

The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university’s strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching–learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching–learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student’s performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students.",Sustainability,journal,,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,N/A,2019,2019-05-17 00:00:00,99,35,"Diego Buenaño-Fernández, David Gil, Sergio Luján-Mora","1397315428, 2060055063, 1405522947",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c0d8c7b571530613aae37dc863b9ed34c13e95b,"Computer Science, Education, Engineering",1397315428

More than 60–80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases can be attributed to HBV infection in high HBV prevalent regions. Although traditional Sanger sequencing has been extensively used to investigate HBV sequences, NGS is becoming more commonly used. Further, it is unknown whether word pattern frequencies of HBV reads by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used to investigate HBV genotypes and predict HCC status. In this study, we used NGS to sequence the pre-S region of the HBV sequence of 94 HCC patients and 45 chronic HBV (CHB) infected individuals. Word pattern frequencies among the sequence data of all individuals were calculated and compared using the Manhattan distance. The individuals were grouped using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Word pattern frequencies were also used to build prediction models for HCC status using both K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). We showed the extremely high power of analyzing HBV sequences using word patterns. Our key findings include that the first principal coordinate of the PCoA analysis was highly associated with the fraction of genotype B (or C) sequences and the second principal coordinate was significantly associated with the probability of having HCC. Hierarchical clustering first groups the individuals according to their major genotypes followed by their HCC status. Using cross-validation, high area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) of around 0.88 for KNN and 0.92 for SVM were obtained. In the independent data set of 46 HCC patients and 31 CHB individuals, a good AUC score of 0.77 was obtained using SVM. It was further shown that 3000 reads for each individual can yield stable prediction results for SVM. Thus, another key finding is that word patterns can be used to predict HCC status with high accuracy. Therefore, our study shows clearly that word pattern frequencies of HBV sequences contain much information about the composition of different HBV genotypes and the HCC status of an individual.",PLoS Genetics,journal,['JournalArticle'],22203759-0bc9-4429-8b67-4140ab209cef,PLoS Genetics,,14,N/A,2018,2018-02-01 00:00:00,14,55,"Xin Bai, Jian-an Jia, M.

In order to assess the relative contribution of HBV and HCV to HCC worldwide, and identify changes over time, we conducted a systematic review of case series published up to the year 2014. Eligible studies had to report seroprevalence of both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti‐HCV), alone and in combination, for at least 20 adult HCC cases. Studies using a first‐generation enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay test for HCV were excluded. A total of 119,000 HCC cases in 260 studies were included from 50 countries. Most European and American countries show a preponderance of HCV over HBV and a substantial fraction of viral marker–negative cases. Asian and African countries generally show a predominance of HBV. The fraction of HCV‐positive HCC cases is substantial in Taiwan, Mongolia, Japan, and Pakistan as well as in Western‐Central Asia and Northern Africa. No eligible studies were available in Oceania, large parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. The United States, Brazil, and Germany show evidence of higher prevalence of HCV in HCC since the year 2000. Conversely, Japan and Italy show a decline in the proportion of HCV‐positive HCC. Conclusion: HBV and HCV are predominant causes of HCC in virtually all world areas, with a growing fraction of HCC cases in several countries attributable to HCV.

The etiopathogenesis of this condition is idiopathic. There are different predisposing factors in the literature which are consistent with the presented case such as lack of anterior prominence of the disc, thinning of the posterior zone of the disc and perforation of the disc. Patient Concerns: We report an uncommon temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthropathy case of a 33-year-old female patient, who presented with long-standing TMJ pain associated with limited mouth opening. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with non-reducible PDD of TMJ bilaterally. Treatment: Open surgery of TMJ (Discopexy) was the choice of treatment to release and mobilise discs. Outcomes: A noticeable increase in mouth opening without pain in TMJ area was achieved immediately after surgery and remained stable during periodic follow-ups.

The present study investigated the effects of ultrasonic excitation on the heat transfer rate in a fin-and-flat tube heat exchanger experimentally. The performance of the heat exchanger was investigated with and without the presence of ultrasonic excitation. A comprehensive parameter study was attempted, so several parameters, including ambient temperature, flow rate, air passing velocity, Reynolds number, and Nusselt number, were studied in a relatively wide range. An adequate uncertainty test, as well as a validation assessment, is provided to certify the credibility of the obtained results and the hired facility. The results revealed that reducing the flow rate, ambient temperature, and air passing velocity on the heat exchanger increased the ultrasonic excitation’s effects. The highest heat transfer enhancement in the present experiment was 70.11%, measured at the lowest air passing velocity and ambient temperature with a Reynolds number 2166. The data presented in this paper will be useful for the optimal design of ultrasonic vibrating fin-and-tube heat exchangers.",Fire,conference,,a33b4339-8ebd-427d-8a4a-2496fca85732,Fire,,,396,2022,2022-12-31 00:00:00,40,28,"A.

However, almost all additively manufactured parts must be post-processed in order to fulfil geometric tolerances, surface quality demands and the desired functional properties. Thus, additive manufacturing actually means the implementation of additive-subtractive process chains. Starting with the most relevant additive processes (powder-based PBF-LB, LMD-p and wire-based WAAM and LMD-w/WLAM), considering intermediate process steps (heat treatment and shot peening) and ending up with post-processing material removal processes (with defined and undefined cutting edges), this paper gives an overview of recent research findings with respect to a comprehensive scientific investigation of influences and interactions within the additive-subtractive process chain. This includes both the macroscopic geometric scale and the microscopic scale of the material structure. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives are derived and discussed.",Journal of Machine Engineering,journal,['Review'],8068ee41-f787-4bcf-a76e-d145c91d484e,Journal of Machine Engineering,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-15 00:00:00,10,216,"H.

c2d8fe7e57ad46ac46fdd8fc873fe13523e308d5,10.1108/frep-06-2023-0022,"Comparing the Harrod-Domar, Solow and Ramsey growth models and their implications for economic policies","PurposeThe principal aim of this paper is to review three basic theoretical growth models, namely the Harrod-Domar model, the Solow model and the Ramsey model, and examine their implications for economic policies.Design/methodology/approachThe paper utilizes a positivist research framework that emphasizes the causal relationships between the variables in each of the three models. Mathematical methods are employed to formulate and examine the three models under study. Since the paper is theoretical, it does not use any empirical data although numerical illustrations are provided whenever they are appropriate.FindingsThe Harrod-Domar model explains why countries with high rates of saving may also enjoy high rate of economic growth. Both the Solow and Ramsey models can be used to explain the medium-income trap. The paper examines the impact of Covid shocks on the macroeconomy. While the growth rate can be recovered, it may not always possible to recover the output level.Research limitations/implicationsFor the Harrod-Domar model, the public spending decreases the private consumption at the period 1, but there is no change in the capital stock and hence the production in subsequent periods. For the Ramsey model with AK production function, both the private consumption and the outputs will be lowered. In both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function, if the debt is not high and the interest rate is sufficiently low, it is better to use public debt for production rather than for consumption. If the country borrows to recover the Total Factor Productivity after the Covid pandemic, both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function show that the rate of growth is higher for the year just after the pandemic but is the same as before the pandemic.Practical implicationsThe economy can recover the growth rate after a Covid shock, but the recovery process will generally take many periods.Social implicationsThis paper focuses on economic implications and does not aim to examine social implications of policy changes or Covid-type shock.Originality/valueThe paper provides a comparison of three basic growth models with respect to public spending, public debts and repayments and Covid-type shocks.",Fulbright Review of Economics and Policy,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",f076d2d5-bb99-45f6-a4e0-fa5811fc41f3,Fulbright Review of Economics and Policy,,,N/A,2023,2023-10-10 00:00:00,3,10,"C.

The dataset includes 564 instances of bank failures and several variables that may be related to the likelihood of such events, such as asset amount, deposit amount, ADR, deposit level, asset level, inflation rate, short-term interest rates, bank reserves, and GDP growth rate. We explore the efficacy of machine learning survival models in predicting bank failures and compare the performance of different models.

This article highlights some recent advances that have had an impact on patient management or could do so in the near future. Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, particularly the epithelioid subtype, is amenable to radical therapy in selected cases, and factors such as ki67 proliferation index, expression of BAP1 and mutation in CDKN2A show promise as prognostic indicators. Our understanding of multicystic mesothelioma has improved in recent years; it is a true neoplasm for which surgery may be indicated. Serous carcinomas involving the peritoneum are now known to originate from tubal epithelium. They are of two distinct types, high grade and low grade, which are now recognized as different neoplasms with distinctive features, oncogenesis and behavior. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is an unusual condition that usually arises from an appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Recent consensus in the classification and nomenclature of these lesions is discussed, including the distinction between low grade and high grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (HAMN), and the diagnostic criteria for appendiceal adenocarcinoma. PMP is divided into four prognostic groups: acellular mucin, low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, and high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei with signet ring cells. The pseudomyxoma microbiome is a promising area for clinical intervention but has been the subject of little research activity. Goblet cell adenocarcinoma (previously known as 'goblet cell carcinoid') is a distinctive type of appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Its behavior correlates with histologic features, but no general consensus for classification has been reached.",Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",61f95257-b067-4f34-bfbd-1381d38d0dea,Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,"

We considered the covid pandemic a black swan event that had caused ambiguity. A significant factor that has increased the probability of bankruptcy in recent times has been the large-scale supply chain disruptions and crippling lockdowns. Firms are trying to get back to pre-Covid utilization of plant capacity or pivot their business models differently to seize newer opportunities amidst the crisis. We considered the change in operating expenditure (primarily decrease) as our proxy for uncertainty as firms were forced to cut down majorly on their operations and thus incurred lesser variable costs. In an economy showing inflationary trends, the operating expenses will generally increase. But we found that the operational costs had shown a dip in the case of many of the firms during FY 20–21, and we attributed it to Covid disruptions.

In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.",Frontiers in Psychology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06,Frontiers in Psychology,,11,N/A,2020,2020-10-19 00:00:00,285,122,"Hui Luan, P.

Particularly in ecological reserves, competition among various types of land use restricts the coordinated development of PLE space. To explore spatial sustainable development, this study starts from a PLE spatial perspective, based on Landsat long time series images. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) and landscape index analysis were selected to monitor the spatial and temporal land use and landscape pattern changes in the Poyang Lake region (PYL region) from 1989 to 2020. The RF-Markov-FLUS coupled model was used to simulate spatial changes in 2030 under four scenarios: production space priority (PSP), living space priority (LSP), ecological space priority (ESP), and an integrated development (ID). Finally, the goal-problem-principle was used to enhance PLE space. The results showed that: (1) production space and ecological spaces decreased in general from 1989 to 2020 by 3% and 7%, respectively; living space increased by 11%. (2) From 1989 to 2020, the overall landscape spread in the Poyang Lake (PYL) area decreased, connectivity decreased, fragmentation increased, landscape heterogeneity increased, and landscape geometry became more irregular. (3) Compared with the other three scenarios, the ID scenario maintained steady production space growth in 2030, the expansion rate of living space slowed, and the area of ecological space decreased the least. (4) Spatial pattern optimization should start with three aspects: the transformation of the agricultural industry, improving the efficiency of urban land use, and establishing communities of “mountains, water, forests, fields, lakes and grasses”.

There are numerous seasonal lakes in the Poyang Lake region, and these lakes create a complex and diverse wetland landscape and serve as the main activity area for migratory birds. Seasonal lakes have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes, but research on seasonal lakes is relatively limited. Based on long-term remote sensing images, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of seasonal lakes and their influencing factors and ecological effects. The conclusions were as follows: the average water area of seasonal lakes showed a unimodal change during the year, reaching a maximum in July and a minimum in January. The interannual water area fluctuated greatly, and the overall water area showed a small downward trend. In terms of spatial variation, the seasonal lakes were connected with the main lake in the wet season and separated from the main lake in the dry season. Among the natural factors, the influences of temperature, evaporation, and rainfall on the water area of the seasonal lakes were successively reduced. In addition, the incoming water from the Yangtze River had an important influence. Among the human factors, the traditional fishing method “enclosing sublakes in autumn” had the greatest impact on the water area in a specific period, followed by the indirect impact of the Three Gorges Project.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,1539,13,N/A,2021,2021-05-30 00:00:00,13,46,"Hai Liu, H.

This paper analyzes changes in cultivated land, the driving factors that cause them, and their tremendous impact on landscape pattern changes in the Dongting Lake Basin. For this purpose, we used mathematical statistics, buffer analysis, trend analysis, landscape pattern index, and logistic regression model to analyze the land use data of the study area from 1980 to 2018. The results show that the cultivated land showed a decreasing trend, with the total area decreased by 4.76% (or 716.13 km2) from 1980 to 2018, and the activity of mutual transformation with other land use types decreased. The spatial distribution pattern of cultivated land and landscape shows the change characteristics gradually from Dongting Lake to the surroundings. Among the driving factors of cultivated land changes, the influence of human activities was gradually increasing, while the natural factors were decreasing. The cultivated land landscape pattern index and the overall landscape pattern index have a significant positive correlation, showing relatively consistent change trend and spatial distribution characteristics. We believe that the decrease of cultivated land area has a certain relationship with the increase of landscape fragmentation in the Dongting Lake Basin.

However, the clinical relevance of glycosylation-related genes (GRGs) in uveal melanoma (UM) is yet to be fully understood. This study aimed to shed light on the impact of GRGs on UM prognosis. Methods To identify the most influential genes in UM, we employed the AUCell and WGCNA algorithms. The GRGs signature was established by integrating bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. UM patients were separated into two groups based on their risk scores, the GCNS_low and GCNS_high groups, and the differences in clinicopathological correlation, functional enrichment, immune response, mutational burden, and immunotherapy between the two groups were examined. The role of the critical gene AUP1 in UM was validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The GRGs signature was comprised of AUP1, HNMT, PARP8, ARC, ALG5, AKAP13, and ISG20. The GCNS was a significant prognostic factor for UM, and high GCNS correlated with poorer outcomes. Patients with high GCNS displayed heightened immune-related characteristics, such as immune cell infiltration and immune scores. In vitro experiments showed that the knockdown of AUP1 led to a drastic reduction in the viability, proliferation, and invasion capability of UM cells. Conclusion Our gene signature provides an independent predictor of UM patient survival and represents a starting point for further investigation of GRGs in UM. It offers a novel perspective on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of UM.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,journal,['JournalArticle'],baea33cc-0a71-4b2a-9f01-5071f7b1abc9,Frontiers in Endocrinology,,14,N/A,2023,2023-03-23 00:00:00,40,51,"Jianlan Liu, Pengpeng Zhang, Fang-mei Yang, Keyu Jiang, Shiyi Sun, Zhijia Xia, G.

Circadian rhythm alterations in tumourigenesis are of equal importance to genetic factors and several biologic clock genes are considered to be prognostic biomarkers for various cancers. The aim of this study was to establish reliable markers based on biologic clock genes, thus providing a new perspective for assessing immunotherapy response and prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Methods We used 502 HNSCC samples and 44 normal samples from the TCGA-HNSCC dataset as the training set. 97 samples from GSE41613 were used as an external validation set. Prognostic characteristics of circadian rhythm-related genes (CRRGs) were established by Lasso, random forest and stepwise multifactorial Cox. Multivariate analysis revealed that CRRGs characteristics were independent predictors of HNSCC, with patients in the high-risk group having a worse prognosis than those in the low-risk group. The relevance of CRRGs to the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy was assessed by an integrated algorithm. Results 6-CRRGs were considered to be strongly associated with HNSCC prognosis and a good predictor of HNSCC. The riskscore established by the 6-CRRG was found to be an independent prognostic factor for HNSCC in multifactorial analysis, with patients in the low-risk group having a higher overall survival (OS) than the high-risk group. Nomogram prediction maps constructed from clinical characteristics and riskscore had good prognostic power. Patients in the low-risk group had higher levels of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint expression and were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusion 6-CRRGs play a key predictive role for the prognosis of HNSCC patients and can guide physicians in selecting potential responders to prioritise immunotherapy, which could facilitate further research in precision immuno-oncology.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,14,N/A,2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,55,87,"Hao Chi, Jinyan Yang, Gaoge Peng, Jinhao Zhang, Guobin Song, Xixi Xie, Zhijia Xia, Jinhui Liu, Gang Tian","2056175119, 2000447626, 2181790063, 2117980663, 2072632648, 2242086213, 103297759, 2108412351, 2146933862",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a219d3fa9537f2c44ef9735cc00f4bbede0d71b8,Medicine,2056175119

Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs.

However, given the complexity of learning analytics (LA) systems, it can be challenging to meaningfully involve non-technical stakeholders throughout their design and development. This article reports on the iterative co-design, development, and classroom evaluation of Konscia, a wearable, real-time awareness tool for teachers working in AI-enhanced K-12 classrooms. In the process, we argue that the co-design of LA systems requires new kinds of prototyping methods. We introduce one of our own prototyping methods, REs, to address unique challenges of co-prototyping LA tools. This work presents the first end-to-end demonstration of how non-technical stakeholders can participate throughout the whole design process for a complex LA system—from early generative phases to the selection and tuning of analytics to evaluation in real-world contexts. We conclude by providing methodological recommendations for future LA co-design efforts.

The purpose of this paper is to present a decade of experience with analyzing and improving an online practice environment for math, which has thus far recorded over a billion responses. We present the methods we use to both steer and analyze this system in real-time, using scoring rules on accuracy and response times, a tailored rating system to provide both learners and items with current ability and difficulty ratings, and an adaptive engine that matches learners to items. Moreover, we explore the quality of fit by means of prediction accuracy and parallel item reliability. Limitations and pitfalls are discussed by diagnosing sources of misfit, like violations of unidimensionality and unforeseen dynamics. Finally, directions for development are discussed, including embedded learning analytics and a focus on online experimentation to evaluate both the system itself and the users’ learning gains. Though many challenges remain open, we believe that large steps have been made in providing methods to efficiently manage and research educational big data from a massive online learning system.",Journal of Learning Analytics,journal,['JournalArticle'],1355ccee-1cfd-459c-8df4-bc82e5f741da,J.

However, there have been no reports of AI‐designed clinical trials. In this study, we tried to develop study designs by a genetic algorithm (GA), which is an AI solution for combination optimization problems. Specifically, the computational design approach was applied to optimize the blood sampling schedule for a bioequivalence (BE) study in pediatrics and optimize the allocation of dose groups for a dose‐finding study. The GA could reduce the number of blood collection points from 15 (typical standard) to seven points without meaningful impact on the accuracy and precision of the pharmacokinetic estimation for the pediatric BE study. For the dose‐finding study, up to 10% reduction of the total number of required subjects from the standard design could be achieved. The GA also created a design that would lead to a drastic reduction of the required number of subjects in the placebo arm while keeping the total number of subjects at a minimum level. These results indicated the potential usefulness of the computational clinical study design approach for innovative drug development.",CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology,,['JournalArticle'],6cd2f709-8cb0-4ed9-bd46-7330c664985e,CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology,522 - 531,12,Unknown,2023,2023-02-15 00:00:00,2,50,"S.

The extraction results contain complex human activities, so the activity journal requires a visualization model to describe actor interactions. This paper proposes a chart to visualize the activities' flow to describe the characters' interactions in an activity journal. This chart is called a storychart. Storycharts have an actor channel that can accept single entities or teams. The actor channel allows changing the type from single to a team or vice versa and moving members to other teams. The activity channel serves as a connector to accommodate interactions between actors. The activity channel provides a visual space for the elements of what, where, and when. Event predicates are the core of what. Therefore, the storychart visualizes the event predicate using glyphs to attract the reader’s attention. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a team channel that can visualize the identity of team members and an activity channel that can visualize the details of events. We invited participants to discover the reader’s perception of the ease of team recognition and the integrity of the meaning of the narrative visualized by the storychart. Participants involved in the evaluation were filtered by literacy score. Evaluation of storychart reading showed that readers could easily distinguish teams from single actors, and storycharts could convey the story in the activity journal with little reduction in meaning.",JOIV: International Journal on Informatics Visualization,journal,['JournalArticle'],0fa5fb50-57a4-4633-aa8f-91804e20ac17,JOIV : International Journal on Informatics Visualization,,,N/A,2023,2023-12-22 00:00:00,1,0,"Zainal Abidin, Rinaldi Munir, Saiful Akbar, Rila Mandala, D.
