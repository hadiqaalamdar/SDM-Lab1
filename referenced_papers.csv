In this work, we developed simulation models for different EV charging scenarios in the home sector. We used them to predict maximum demand based on the increasing penetration of EV consumers. We comprehensively reviewed the literature on EV charging technologies, battery capacity, charging situations, and the impact of EV loads. Our results suggest a method for visualizing the impact of EV charging loads by considering factors such as state of charge, arrival time, charging duration, rate of charge, maximum charging power, and involvement rate. This method can be used to model load profiles and determine the number of chargers needed to meet EV user demand. We also explored the use of a time-of-use (TOU) tariff as a demand response strategy, which encourages EV owners to charge their vehicles off-peak in order to avoid higher demand charges. Our simulation results show the effects of various charging conditions on load profiles and indicate that the current TOU price strategy can accommodate a 20% growth in EV consumers, while the alternative TOU price strategy can handle up to a 30% penetration level.",Energies,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2023,2023-04-20 00:00:00,13,36,"Pramote Jaruwatanachai, Yod Sukamongkol, T.

Previous studies have sought to identify the various factors influencing EV charging patterns to deploy an appropriate charging infrastructure. However, limited attention has been paid to the investigation of different charging patterns identified in different regions at different phases of the EV program. This study aims to fill this research gap in the literature by developing binary logistic models that account for the factors influencing charging demands in different regions of Korea, i.e., Jeju-do and Gangneung-si. To this end, we collected historical data on EV charging transactions in these study regions and analyzed them to evaluate the difference in charging demands. The developed models suggest that the charging demand varies with charger characteristics and charging time. Moreover, different charging patterns in different regions can be explained by the different travel behaviors of those who use EVs for different trip purposes. These findings provide an important implication suggesting that policymakers should consider a stepwise strategy to construct charging infrastructure at the appropriate scale and configuration, depending on the phase of the EV program.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-15 00:00:00,6,25,"Dae-yun Kim, Doyun Kwon, Jihoon Han, S.

This study identifies user behavioral patterns by analyzing data from more than 7000 charging stations in Canada, comparing residential vs. public Level 2, and public direct current fast (DCFC) vs. public Level 2 charging. A novel algorithm, CHAODA, was applied to identify differences between DCFC and other Level 2 charging options. Through a multivariate and holistic methodology, various patterns emerge, identifying differences in the utilization and seasonality of different EVSE types. The study provides evidence of an “EV Duck Curve” that amplifies the baseline of the power production “Duck Curve,” confirming future challenges for grid stability. Implementations of this study can support future EVSE infrastructure planning efforts and help improve the overall service of electric vehicle supply equipment and grid stability.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2023,2023-02-05 00:00:00,35,49,"T.

While various governments promote EVs, people feel “range anxiety” because of their limited driving range or charge capacity. A limited number of charging stations are available, which results in a strong demand for predicting energy consumed by EVs. In this paper, machine learning (ML) models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to investigate the total energy consumption (TEC) by the EVs. The independent variables used for the study include changing real-life situations or external parameters, such as trip distance, tire type, driving style, power, odometer reading, EV model, city, motorway, country roads, air conditioning, and park heating. We compared the ML models’ performance along with the error analysis. A pairwise correlation study showed that trip distance has a high correlation coefficient (0.87) with TEC. XGBoost had better prediction accuracy (~92%) or R2 (0.92). Trip distance, power, heating, and odometer reading were the most important features influencing the TEC, identified using the shapley additive explanations method.",World Electric Vehicle Journal,journal,,6fc2b7b5-0526-4df5-b942-b1b93f3cf248,World Electric Vehicle Journal,,,N/A,2021,2021-06-29 00:00:00,28,24,"Sugam Pokharel, Pradip Sah, Deepak Ganta","2128916182, 2129350920, 1621181211",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bf43099563822c04eb58e6ac7c745680eafcbe7,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science, Mathematics",2128916182

Generally, monitoring energy consumption has become one of the most important factors in green and micro grids; therefore, predicting the charging demand of PEVs (the energy consumed during the charging session) could help to efficiently manage the electric grid. Consequently, three machine learning methods are applied in this research to predict the charging demand for the PEV user after a charging session starts. This approach is validated using a dataset consisting of seven years of charging events collected from public charging stations in the state of Nebraska, USA. The results show that the regression method, XGBoost, slightly outperforms the other methods in predicting the charging demand, with an RMSE equal to 6.68 kWh and R2 equal to 51.9%. The relative importance of input variables is also discussed, showing that the user’s historical average demand has the most predictive value. Accurate prediction of session charging demand, as opposed to the daily or hourly demand of multiple users, has many possible applications for utility companies and charging networks, including scheduling, grid stability, and smart grid integration.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2020,2020-08-16 00:00:00,122,64,"Ahmad Almaghrebi, Fares Aljuheshi, Mostafa Rafaie, Kevin James, M.

In apartment complexes, which have emerged as a common residential type in metropolitan areas and highly populated districts, high charging demand could result in substantial stress to distribution networks. In this work, the effect of EV charging power demand in an apartment complex on the aging of the Distribution Transformer (DT) is studied. A methodology based on the stochastic characterization of vehicle usage profiles and user charging patterns is developed to obtain realistic EV charging demand profiles. Based on the modeled EV charging profile and the transformer thermal model, the effect of different EV penetration ratios on DT aging for an apartment complex in the Republic of Korea is studied. Results for an EV penetration ratio of up to 30% indicated that DT aging could be accelerated by up to 40%, compared to the case without EV charging. To mitigate this accelerated DT aging caused by EV charging, the effectiveness of two integration approaches of Photovoltaic (PV) sources was studied. Based on a case study that included a realistic PV generation profile, it was demonstrated that a significant contribution to DT reliability could be achieved via the operation of PV sources. A more apparent contribution of PV integration was observed with an energy storage installation at higher EV penetration ratios. At an EV penetration ratio of 30%, a maximum decrease of 41.8% in the loss-of-life probability of the DT was achieved. The effects of different PV integration approaches and power management details on DT aging were also studied. The results demonstrate that the EV charging demand could introduce a significant level of stress to DTs and that this impact can be effectively mitigated by installing PV sources. These observations are expected to contribute toward the effective planning of power system infrastructures that support the design of sustainable cities with the widespread use of EVs.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2020,2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,67,"Shin-Ki Hong, S.

Methods Individual patient data from all six eligible randomised controlled trials were used to develop (k = 3, n = 1722) and test (k = 3, n = 918) nine models. Predictors included depressive and anxiety symptoms, social support, life events and alcohol use. Weighted sum scores were developed using coefficient weights derived from network centrality statistics (models 1–3) and factor loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (model 4). Unweighted sum score models were tested using elastic net regularised (ENR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression (models 5 and 6). Individual items were then included in ENR and OLS (models 7 and 8). All models were compared to one another and to a null model (mean post-baseline Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) score in the training data: model 9). Primary outcome: BDI-II scores at 3–4 months. Results Models 1–7 all outperformed the null model and model 8. Model performance was very similar across models 1–6, meaning that differential weights applied to the baseline sum scores had little impact. Conclusions Any of the modelling techniques (models 1–7) could be used to inform prognostic predictions for depressed adults with differences in the proportions of patients reaching remission based on the predicted severity of depressive symptoms post-treatment. However, the majority of variance in prognosis remained unexplained.

One of the most challenging problems in cloud computing is detecting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The attack detection framework for the DDoS attack is tricky because of its nonlinear nature of interruption activities, atypical system traffic behaviour, and many features in the problem space. As a result, creating defensive solutions against these attacks is critical for mainstream cloud computing adoption. In this novel research, by using performance parameters, perplexed-based classifiers with and without feature selection will be compared with the existing machine learning algorithms such as naïve Bayes and random forest to prove the efficacy of the perplexed-based classification algorithm. Comparing the performance parameters like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, the proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 99%, which is higher than the existing algorithms, proving that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in detecting the DDoS attacks in cloud computing systems. To extend our research in the area of nature-inspired computing, we compared our perplexed Bayes classifier feature selection with nature-inspired feature selection like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and found that our classifier is highly efficient in comparison with GA and PSO and their accuracies are 2% and 8%, respectively, less than those of perplexed Bayes classifier.",Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],f32b7322-b69c-4e63-801d-8f50784ef778,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,2022,N/A,2022,2022-07-19 00:00:00,17,41,"N.

We introduce an uncertainty‐controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA) based on ensemble machine learning predictions from different molecular representations that concurrently optimizes excited state energies, synthesizability, and exciton size for the discovery of singlet fission materials. The ucGA allows us to efficiently explore the chemical space spanned by the reFORMED fragment database, which consists of 45,000 cores and 5,000 substituents derived from crystallographic structures assembled in the FORMED repository. Running the ucGA in an exploitative setup performs local optimization on variations of known singlet fission scaffolds, such as acenes. In an explorative mode, hitherto unknown candidates displaying excellent excited state properties for singlet fission are generated. We suggest a class of heteroatom‐rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge‐transfer mediated singlet fission. When included in larger donor‐acceptor systems, these units exhibit localization of the triplet state, favorable diradicaloid character and suitable triplet energies for exciton injection into semiconductor solar cells.",Angewandte Chemie,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Angewandte Chemie (International Ed. in English),,64,Unknown,2024,2024-09-25 00:00:00,1,9,"Luca Schaufelberger, J.

Inspired by nonequilibrium statistical physics, these models can generate 3D molecular structures with specific properties or requirements crucial to drug discovery. Diffusion models were particularly successful at learning the complex probability distributions of 3D molecular geometries and their corresponding chemical and physical properties through forward and reverse diffusion processes. This review focuses on the technical implementation of diffusion models tailored for 3D molecular generation. It compares the performance, evaluation methods, and implementation details of various diffusion models used for molecular generation tasks. We cover strategies for atom and bond representation, architectures of reverse diffusion denoising networks, and challenges associated with generating stable 3D molecular structures. This review also explores the applications of diffusion models in de novo drug design and related areas of computational chemistry, such as structure-based drug design, including target-specific molecular generation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics of protein–ligand complexes. We also cover conditional generation on physical properties, conformation generation, and fragment-based drug design.

An open challenge in this area is designing linkers between disconnected molecular fragments of interest to obtain chemically relevant candidate drug molecules. In this work, we propose DiffLinker, an E(3)-equivariant three-dimensional conditional diffusion model for molecular linker design. Given a set of disconnected fragments, our model places missing atoms in between and designs a molecule incorporating all the initial fragments. Unlike previous approaches that are only able to connect pairs of molecular fragments, our method can link an arbitrary number of fragments. Additionally, the model automatically determines the number of atoms in the linker and its attachment points to the input fragments. We demonstrate that DiffLinker outperforms other methods on the standard datasets, generating more diverse and synthetically accessible molecules. We experimentally test our method in real-world applications, showing that it can successfully generate valid linkers conditioned on target protein pockets.",Nat. Mac.

Implemented algorithms include automated procedures for conformational sampling, explicit solvation studies, the calculation of absolute molecular entropy, and the identification of molecular protonation and deprotonation sites. Calculations are set up to run concurrently, providing efficient single-node parallelization. CREST is designed to require minimal user input and comes with an implementation of the GFNn-xTB Hamiltonians and the GFN-FF force-field. Furthermore, interfaces to any quantum chemistry and force-field software can easily be created. In this article, we present recent developments in the CREST code and show a selection of applications for the most important features of the program.

GaUDI shows improved conditional design, generating molecules with optimal properties and even going beyond the original distribution to suggest better molecules than those in the dataset. In addition to point-wise targets, GaUDI can also be guided toward open-ended targets (for example, a minimum or maximum) and in all cases achieves close to 100% validity of generated molecules.

Recently, machine learning (ML) models have shown remarkable performance for prediction of TS geometries. However, they require 3D conformations of reactants and products often with their appropriate orientations as input, which demands substantial efforts and computational cost. Here, we propose a generative approach based on the stochastic diffusion method, namely TSDiff, for prediction of TS geometries just from 2D molecular graphs. TSDiff outperforms the existing ML models with 3D geometries in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it enables to sample various TS conformations, because it learns the distribution of TS geometries for diverse reactions in training. Thus, TSDiff finds more favorable reaction pathways with lower barrier heights than those in the reference database. These results demonstrate that TSDiff shows promising potential for an efficient and reliable TS exploration.

Particularly, the single deep learning model may not be effective to capture unique patterns from intrusive attacks having a small number of samples. In order to further enhance the performance of machine learning based IDS, we propose the Big Data based Hierarchical Deep Learning System (BDHDLS). BDHDLS utilizes behavioral features and content features to understand both network traffic characteristics and information stored in the payload. Each deep learning model in the BDHDLS concentrates its efforts to learn the unique data distribution in one cluster. This strategy can increase the detection rate of intrusive attacks as compared to the previous single learning model approaches. Based on parallel training strategy and big data techniques, the model construction time of BDHDLS is reduced substantially when multiple machines are deployed.",Big Data Mining and Analytics,journal,['JournalArticle'],fa31ff53-6717-46c5-934d-9f21c27f96ba,Big Data Min.

Recent studies have applied conventional machine learning to network attack detection by learning the patterns of the network behaviors and training a classification model. These models usually require large labeled datasets; however, the rapid pace and unpredictability of cyber attacks make this labeling impossible in real time. To address these problems, we proposed utilizing transfer learning for detecting new and unseen attacks by transferring the knowledge of the known attacks. In our previous work, we have proposed a transfer learning-enabled framework and approach, called HeTL, which can find the common latent subspace of two different attacks and learn an optimized representation, which was invariant to attack behaviors’ changes. However, HeTL relied on manual pre-settings of hyper-parameters such as relativeness between the source and target attacks. In this paper, we extended this study by proposing a clustering-enhanced transfer learning approach, called CeHTL, which can automatically find the relation between the new attack and known attack. We evaluated these approaches by stimulating scenarios where the testing dataset contains different attack types or subtypes from the training set. We chose several conventional classification models such as decision trees, random forests, KNN, and other novel transfer learning approaches as strong baselines. Results showed that proposed HeTL and CeHTL improved the performance remarkably. CeHTL performed best, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in detecting new network attacks.",EURASIP Journal on Information Security,journal,['JournalArticle'],885ece6c-fb93-402d-853f-d7ba96a7ba66,EURASIP Journal on Information Security,,2019,N/A,2019,2019-02-21 00:00:00,98,31,"Juan Zhao, S.

In this paper, we explore how to model an intrusion detection system based on deep learning, and we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS). Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the performance of the proposed model. We compare it with those of J48, artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and other machine learning methods proposed by previous researchers on the benchmark data set. The experimental results show that RNN-IDS is very suitable for modeling a classification model with high accuracy and that its performance is superior to that of traditional machine learning classification methods in both binary and multiclass classification.

This paper proposes a new facial emotional recognition model using a convolutional neural network. Our proposed model, “ConvNet”, detects seven specific emotions from image data including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise. The features extracted by the Local Binary Pattern (LBP), region based Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) and Convolutional Neural network (CNN) from facial expressions images were fused to develop the classification model through training by our proposed CNN model (ConvNet). Our method can converge quickly and achieves good performance which the authors can develop a real-time schema that can easily fit the model and sense emotions. Furthermore, this study focuses on the mental or emotional stuff of a man or woman using the behavioral aspects. To complete the training of the CNN network model, we use the FER2013 databases at first, and then apply the generalization techniques to the JAFFE and CK+ datasets respectively in the testing stage to evaluate the performance of the model. In the generalization approach on the JAFFE dataset, we get a 92.05% accuracy, while on the CK+ dataset, we acquire a 98.13% accuracy which achieve the best performance among existing methods. We also test the system’s success by identifying facial expressions in real-time. ConvNet consists of four layers of convolution together with two fully connected layers. The experimental results show that the ConvNet is able to achieve 96% training accuracy which is much better than current existing models. However, when compared to other validation methods, the suggested technique was more accurate. ConvNet also achieved validation accuracy of 91.01% for the FER2013 dataset.

However, students often get distracted because of various reasons, which affect their learning capacity to a great extent.

This paper intends to provide a mechanism that uses the camera feed and microphone input to monitor the real-time attention level of students during online classes. We explore various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms throughout this study. We propose a system that uses five distinct non-verbal features to calculate the attention score of the student during computer-based tasks and generate real-time feedback for both students and the organization.

The existing student behavior recognition methods mainly focus on the behavior of the single student and have low performance and efficiency. To recognize the behaviors of multiple students in the classroom at the same time, we propose a fast and effective solution, called ET-YOLOv5s, which is an improved YOLOv5s with ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) and a tiny object detection module in this paper. First, the ESRGAN is adopted to generate high-definition images from original images of real classroom environments in colleges to improve the recognition accuracy. Then a tiny object detection module is added to the YOLOv5s to detect the smaller objects on high-definition images, such as phones, books, and students sitting at the back of the classroom. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed solution can detect 11 kinds of students’ behaviors in classrooms, including playing mobile phones, having class, sitting with hands on face, sitting turn right, sitting turn left, bowing, sleeping, and so on.

e632d642dc115a7f4cb7d881481ed61e70200af8,10.1145/3610219,Understanding the Role of Human Intuition on Reliance in Human-AI Decision-Making with Explanations,"AI explanations are often mentioned as a way to improve human-AI decision-making, but empirical studies have not found consistent evidence of explanations' effectiveness and, on the contrary, suggest that they can increase overreliance when the AI system is wrong. While many factors may affect reliance on AI support, one important factor is how decision-makers reconcile their own intuition---beliefs or heuristics, based on prior knowledge, experience, or pattern recognition, used to make judgments---with the information provided by the AI system to determine when to override AI predictions. We conduct a think-aloud, mixed-methods study with two explanation types (feature- and example-based) for two prediction tasks to explore how decision-makers' intuition affects their use of AI predictions and explanations, and ultimately their choice of when to rely on AI. Our results identify three types of intuition involved in reasoning about AI predictions and explanations: intuition about the task outcome, features, and AI limitations. Building on these, we summarize three observed pathways for decision-makers to apply their own intuition and override AI predictions. We use these pathways to explain why (1) the feature-based explanations we used did not improve participants' decision outcomes and increased their overreliance on AI, and (2) the example-based explanations we used improved decision-makers' performance over feature-based explanations and helped achieve complementary human-AI performance. Overall, our work identifies directions for further development of AI decision-support systems and explanation methods that help decision-makers effectively apply their intuition to achieve appropriate reliance on AI.",Proc.

However, despite the number of publications related to LbL assembly, predicting LbL coating properties represents quite a challenge, can take a long time, and be very costly. Machine learning (ML) methodologies that are now emerging can accelerate and improve new coating development and potentially revolutionize the field. Recently, we have demonstrated a preliminary ML-based model for coating thickness prediction. In this paper, we compared several ML algorithms for optimizing a methodology for coating thickness prediction, namely, linear regression, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Extra Tree Regressor. The current research has shown that learning algorithms are effective in predicting the coating output value, with the Extra Tree Regressor algorithm demonstrating superior predictive performance, when used in combination with optimized hyperparameters and with missing data imputation. The best predictors of the coating thickness were determined, and they can be later used to accurately predict coating thickness, avoiding measurement of multiple parameters. The development of optimized methodologies will ensure different reliable predictive models for coating property/function relations. As a continuation, the methodology can be adapted and used for predicting the outputs connected to antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties in order to be able to respond to actual biomedical problems such as antibiotic resistance, implant rejection, or COVID-19 outbreak.",ACS Omega,,['JournalArticle'],d516f81c-009b-445d-b748-c827efa137d3,ACS Omega,4677 - 4686,8,Unknown,2023,2023-01-29 00:00:00,10,26,"T.

In this context, new implant materials and coatings that deal with medical device-associated complications are required. Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory materials are also required for wound healing applications, especially in diabetic patients with chronic wounds. In this work, we present hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels with triple activity: antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and miRNA delivery agent. We demonstrate that polyarginine with a degree of polymerization of 30 (PAR30), which was previously shown to have a prolonged antibacterial activity, decreases inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated macrophages. In addition, PAR30 accelerated fibroblast migration in macrophage/fibroblast co-culture system, suggesting a positive effect on wound healing. Furthermore, PAR30 allowed to load miRNA into HA hydrogels, and then to deliver them into the cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first describing miRNA-loaded hydrogels with antibacterial effect and anti-inflammatory features. Such system can become a tool for the treatment of infected wounds, e.g. diabetic ulcers, as well as for foreign body response modulation. This article is protected by copyright.

Even though the mechanisms of LbL film development are well-established, currently there are no predictive models that can link film components with their final properties. The current health crisis has shown the importance of accelerated development of biomedical solutions such as antiviral coatings, and the implementation of machine learning methodologies for coating development can enable achieving this. In this work, using literature data and newly generated experimental results, we first analyzed the relative impact of 23 coating parameters on the coating thickness. Next, a predictive model has been developed using aforementioned parameters and molecular descriptors of polymers from the DeepChem library. Model performance was limited because of insufficient number of data points in the training set, due to the scarce availability of data in the literature. Despite this limitation, we demonstrate, for the first time, utilization of machine learning for prediction of LbL coating properties. It can decrease the time necessary to obtain functional coating with desired properties, as well as decrease experimental costs and enable the fast first response to crisis situations (such as pandemics) where coatings can positively contribute. Besides coating thickness, which was selected as an output value in this study, machine learning approach can be potentially used to predict functional properties of multilayer coatings, e.g. biocompatibility, cell adhesive, antibacterial, antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,N/A,2021,2021-09-21 00:00:00,9,42,"V.

When HyA of the desired molecular weight is implanted into the human body for regeneration of damaged tissue, it is degraded by hyaluronidase in associated with an inflammatory response. This study sought to evaluate the effects of HyA molecular weight and concentration on pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in murine macrophages. The structures and molecular weights of HyAs (LMW-10, MMW-100, MMW-500, and HMW-1,500) were confirmed by 1 H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), respectively. After treatment of murine macrophages with a low (10 µg/mL) or high (100 µg/mL) concentration of each molecular weight HyA, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and changes in immune response in both LPS-stimulated and untreated macrophages were evaluated by assessing nitric oxide (NO) production, and analyzing expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes including by RT-PCR. Molecular weights of LMW-10, MMW-100, MMW-500, and HMW-1,500 were 13,241 ± 161, 96,531 ± 1,167, 512,657 ± 8,545, and 1,249,500 ± 37,477 Da, respectively. NO production by LPS-stimulated macrophages was decreased by increasing concentrations and molecular weights of HyA. At a high concentration of 100 µg/mL, HMW-1,500 reduced NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages to about 45 %. Using NanoString technology, we also found that the immune-related genes TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-11, CCL2, and Arg1 were specifically over-expressed in LPS-stimulated macrophages treated with various molecular weights of HyA. An RT-PCR analysis of gene expression showed that HMW-1,500 decreased expression of classically activated (M1) macrophage genes, such as TNF‐α, IL-6, CCL2, and IL-1β, in LPS-stimulated macrophages, whereas medium molecular-weight HyA (MMW-100 and MMW-500) instead increased expression levels of these genes. HMW-1,500 at a high concentration (100 µg/mL) significantly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Expression of genes associated with anti-inflammatory responses (M2 phenotype), such as TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-11, and Arg1, were increased by high concentrations of MMW-500 and HMW-1,500 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. High molecular-weight HyA (i.e., > 1,250 kDa) inhibits pro-inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages and induces anti-inflammatory responses in a concentration dependent manner.",Biomaterials Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],123b5caf-1ba4-48cc-937f-05ac75234c32,Biomaterials Research,,25,N/A,2021,2021-06-28 00:00:00,81,60,"Bo Mi Lee, S.

However, despite its promises, their adoption in educational institutions is slow. There are many barriers to the adoption of OER, and many are from within the community of OER advocates. This commentary calls for a wider discussion to remove these barriers to mainstreaming OER in teaching and learning and argues for a rethinking of the idea of ‘open’ to make it more inclusive by redefining the concept. It reminds us of the original thinking behind OER – which was to create universally available educational resources that can improve the quality of teaching and learning. This commentary posits arguments against conflating OER and open education, questions the narrow definitions of OER, and raises issues around how to be more flexible and open to mainstreaming OER and removing barriers from within the OER movement.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Distance Education,369 - 380,38,Unknown,2017,2017-08-24 00:00:00,112,39,Sanjaya Mishra,34030129,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c6bf2dd4ba1d0a5a98be5cfdf5ababe60cd0d47,"Computer Science, Education",34030129

The study aims to clarify the macrophage heterogeneity and phenotype dynamics, and pinpoint critical targets within efferocytosis in DKD. Methods Utilizing early human DKD sequencing data, we computed the potential communication between leukocytes and renal intrinsic cells. Subsequently, we scrutinized the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from CD45-enriched immune cells, concentrating on the macrophage subsets in DKD. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was conducted to explore cell development. Differential expression genes (DEGs) from macrophage subgroups and bulk RNA-sequencing were used to identify shared hub genes. The NephroseqV5 platform was employed to evaluate the clinical significance, and the expression of key molecules was validated in DKD tissues. Results Macrophage infiltration rose in DKD, causing inflammation through the release of chemokines. As time progressed, the number of resident macrophages substantially dropped, with diminishing M1-like and increasing M2-like phenotypes relative to early stages. Further analysis pointed to the most enrichment of macrophage function is the phagosome. We overlapped the DEGs with efferocytosis-related genes and identified key genes, including CD36, ITGAM, and CX3CR1, which exhibited significant correlations with macrophages and T cells. The Nephroseq database revealed that they are associated with proteinuria and renal function. Consistent with the validation set, in vivo experiments verified elevated expression levels of key molecules. Conclusions In essence, our research elucidated the dynamics in macrophage subtype transitions. It emphasized three pivotal genes as critical modulators of macrophage efferocytosis in DKD, indicating their potential as innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,16,N/A,2025,2025-02-19 00:00:00,1,54,"Binshan Zhang, Yunqi Wu, Zhongli Wang, Suhua Gao, Hongyan Liu, Yao Lin, Pei Yu","2334735633, 2306834116, 2334581284, 2339422376, 2115669246, 2149202194, 2271660714",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61e5330e744545c8b4c92f51c818223acaa277df,"Biology, Medicine",2334735633

Using a combination of bioinformatics and biological assays, this study conducted an in-depth investigation of the effects of 34. The results of this study have substantial implications for cancer research and treatment. 34 has shown remarkable efficacy in inhibiting the growth of several cancer cell lines, including those representing prostate carcinoma (PC3) and cervical carcinoma (HeLa). The high sensitivity of these cells, indicated by low IC50 values, underscores its potential as a promising chemotherapeutic agent. In addition, 34 has revealed the ability to induce cell cycle arrest, particularly in the G2/M phase, a phenomenon with critical implications for tumor initiation and growth. By interfering with DNA replication in cancer cells, 34 has shown the capacity to trigger cell death, offering a new avenue for cancer treatment. In addition, computational analyses have identified key genes affected by 34 treatment, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. These genes are involved in critical biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication and microtubule dynamics, all of which are central to cancer development and progression. In conclusion, this study highlights the different mechanisms of 34 that inhibit cancer cell growth and alter the cell cycle. These promising results suggest the potential for more effective and less toxic anticancer therapies.

However, a comprehensive study has not yet been undertaken examining the immunological and predictive effects of TUBA1B in a pan-carcinoma context. Using data from TCGA, GEO, and other databases, we analyzed TUBA1B expression across various carcinoma types using transcriptional profiling, prognostic implications, genetic and epigenetic alterations, methylation patterns, and immunological significance. To validate our findings, we conducted Western blot analysis to assess TUBA1B protein levels in matched breast cancer tissue samples and performed CCK-8 proliferation assay, flow cytometry, transwell invasion, and migration assays to comprehensively examine the functional impact of TUBA1B on breast cancer cells. Our pan-cancer analysis found TUBA1B upregulation across most tumor types, with varying expression patterns in distinct immune and molecular subtypes. High TUBA1B expression was an independent risk factor and associated with poor prognoses in several cancers, including BRCA, KICH, LGG, LUAD, and MESO. TUBA1B also demonstrates moderate to high diagnostic accuracy in most tumor types. Increased m6A methylation levels were observed in the TUBA1B gene, while its promoter region displayed low methylation levels. TUBA1B's expression impacted some cancers by elevating tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, neoantigen formation, immune cell infiltration, and the modulation of immune checkpoints. Functional enrichment analysis highlights TUBA1B’s involvement in important cellular processes such as the cell cycle, p53 signaling, cell senescence, programmed cell death, and the regulation of immune-related pathways. Moreover, our study reveals higher TUBA1B protein expression in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent tissues. In vitro experiments confirm that TUBA1B deletion reduces breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while increasing apoptosis. In conclusion, our study suggests that TUBA1B could potentially serve as a diagnostic marker for predicting cancer immunological profiles and survival outcomes and shed light on the expression and role of TUBA1B in breast cancer, providing a solid foundation for considering it as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer patient treatment.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,14,N/A,2024,2024-04-08 00:00:00,11,49,"Yiyang Wang, Yongxiang Li, Yubo Jing, Yuqi Yang, Haiyang Wang, Dilimulati Ismtula, Chenming Guo","2175083230, 2275278432, 2295773643, 2295843376, 2290437613, 2174195328, 2115610836",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a2fedfc6c4216151003b51e800bdf0184033942b,"Biology, Medicine",2175083230

The aim of this investigation is to assess the potential application of tubulin alpha-1b (TUBA1B) as a biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring the outcome of LUAD. Methods: The clinical data of the LUAD patients was retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of a tissue microarray containing 90 LUAD cases was implemented to examine the expression of TUBA1B. The protein and mRNA levels of TUBA1B in serum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis respectively. UALCAN was employed to confirm the expression levels and survival probability of TUBA1B in LUAD patients. Results: Compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues in the microarray, the expression of TUBA1B in LUAD tissues was much higher. The expression of TUBA1B in LUAD was statistically correlated with lymph node status (P = .031). Moreover, patients with higher TUBA1B expression had shorter overall survival (P < .0001). Furthermore, cox multi-factor analysis also suggested that TUBA1B may be an independent predictor for LUAD prognosis (P = .030). The results of TCGA data analysis by UALCAN were consistent with the microarray results, except for that TUBA1B was also significantly correlated with clinical tumor stages. Protein levels of TUBA1B in serum were obviously elevated in LUAD patients than control (P < .0001), and the area under the ROC curve was 0.99. TUBA1B also showed better sensitivity of 92.9% for LUAD than common clinical biomarkers.

The conventional treatment of PAAD shows poor results, and patients have poor prognosis. The synthesis and degradation of proteins are essential for the occurrence and development of tumors. Aggrephagy is a type of autophagy that selectively degrades aggregated proteins. It decreases the formation of aggregates by degrading proteins, thus reducing the harm to cells. By breaking down proteins, it decreases the formation of aggregates; thus, minimizing damage to cells. For evaluating the response to immunotherapy and prognosis in PAAD patients, in this study, we developed a reliable signature based on aggrephagy-related genes (ARGs). We obtained 298 AGGLncRNAs. Based on the results of one-way Cox and LASSO analyses, the lncRNA signature was constructed. In the risk model, the prognosis of patients in the low-risk group was noticeably better than that of the patients in the high-risk group. Additionally, the ROC curves and nomograms validated the capacity of the risk model to predict the prognosis of PAAD. The patients in the low-risk and high-risk groups showed considerable variations in functional enrichment and immunological analysis. Regarding drug sensitivity, the low-risk and high-risk groups had different half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50).",Genes,journal,['JournalArticle'],3a435ff9-d0c3-4eb9-9a89-992c0f8bf398,Genes,,14,N/A,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,36,71,"Xueyuan Huang, Hao Chi, S.

Combined with the acquired resistance to standard treatments and recurrence, GBM is an especially deadly malignancy with hardly any worthwhile treatment options. The treatment resistance of GBM is influenced, in large part, by the contributions from two main degradative pathways in eukaryotic cells: ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. These two systems influence GBM cell survival by removing and recycling cellular components that have been damaged by treatments, as well as by modulating metabolism and selective degradation of components of cell survival or cell death pathways. There has recently been a large amount of interest in potential cancer therapies involving modulation of UPS or autophagy pathways. There is significant crosstalk between the two systems that pose therapeutic challenges, including utilization of ubiquitin signaling, the degradation of components of one system by the other, and compensatory activation of autophagy in the case of proteasome inhibition for GBM cell survival and proliferation. There are several important regulatory nodes which have functions affecting both systems. There are various molecular components at the intersections of UPS and autophagy pathways that pose challenges but also show some new therapeutic opportunities for GBM.

Survival analysis revealed that TUBA1C was a poor prognostic factor for 12 tumour types, and mutations, CNVs, and methylation affected the prognosis of some cancer types. Furthermore, TUBA1C was found to be related to immune-related genes, immune cell infiltration, and the immune microenvironment.

Material and methods We used two publicly available datasets of postero-anterior chest radiographs, which are from Montgomery County, Maryland, and Shenzhen, China. A CNN (ConvNet) from scratch was trained to automatically detect TB on chest radiographs. Also, a CNN-based transfer learning approach using five different pre-trained models, including Inception_v3, Xception, ResNet50, VGG19, and VGG16 was utilized for classifying TB and normal cases from CXR images. The performance of models for testing datasets was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, precision, area under curve (AUC), and F1-score. Results All proposed models provided an acceptable accuracy for two-class classification. Our proposed CNN architecture (i.e., ConvNet) achieved 88.0% precision, 87.0% sensitivity, 87.0% F1-score, 87.0% accuracy, and AUC of 87.0%, which was slightly less than the pre-trained models.

Background The importance of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and PET based imaging for the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer cannot be understated. Accurate staging has become another significant milestone with the use of PET scans, particularly with prostate specific radiotracers like 68-Gallium Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (68Ga-PSMA). Integrated PET/MRI systems are commercially available and can be modulated to evaluate the unique needs of localized as well as recurrent prostate cancer. Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar using the MeSH compliant and other keywords that included prostate cancer, PSA, mpMRI, PET CT, PET/MRI. Conclusions mpMRI has now established itself as the gold-standard of local prostate imaging and has been incorporated into international guidelines as part of the diagnostic work-up of prostate cancer. PSMA PET/CT has shown superiority over conventional imaging even in staging of localized prostate cancer based on recent randomized control data. Imaging parameters from PET/MRI have been shown to be associated with malignancy, Gleason score and tumour volume. As mpMRI and PSMA PET/CT become more ubiquitous and established; we can anticipate more high-quality data, cost optimization and increasing availability of PET/MRI to be ready for primetime in localized prostate cancer.",Translational Andrology and Urology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",d5fbf520-f611-4526-b564-b6fa362d68e9,Translational Andrology and Urology,3117 - 3129,10,N/A,2021,2021-01-01 00:00:00,7,85,"S.

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Public sector employees. Participants 3550 participants of the Finnish Retirement and Aging study. Primary and secondary outcome measures Participants estimated on a yearly questionnaire their weekly hours of different types of activities converted to metabolic equivalent of task-hour/week. Self-rated health was assessed on a 5-point Likert-like scale from poor to excellent and dichotomised as suboptimal and optimal. Multivariate trajectory analysis was used to distinguish different subgroups of trajectories. Multinomial regression analysis was used to describe the associations between covariates and the probability of being classified to a certain trajectory group. Results Three trajectory groups were identified, all displaying increasing activity during retirement with a simultaneous decrease in perceived suboptimal health. Physical activity peaked at 18 months after retirement and then slightly decreased, except for initially highly physically active participants (9%) with good self-rated health, who demonstrated a constant high level of physical activity. Male gender, professional occupation, being married or cohabiting, body mass index <30 kg/m2, not smoking and using alcohol below risk levels were associated with higher physical activity and better self-rated health. Conclusion Changes in physical activity and perceived health during retirement transition were interconnected. Both were improved during retirement transition, but the change was temporary. Longer follow-up studies are required to assess the changes over a longer period after retirement.",BMJ Open,journal,['JournalArticle'],e6216b43-2428-4aaf-8101-b40e1dfd2810,BMJ Open,,13,N/A,2023,2023-09-01 00:00:00,2,34,"Roosa Lintuaho, M.

Given the country’s aging population and recent liberalization of the two-child policy, understanding the effects of intergenerational caregiving on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals is crucial. This study aimed to explore the impact of intergenerational caregiving on mental health among middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals. Methods We analyzed data from the China Health and Aging Tracking Survey (CHARLS) 2013, consisting of 6602 participants finally. Personal information, family structure, financial support, health status, and physical measurements were selected for analysis. Correlation and regression analyses were used for relationships among variables controlling for potential confounding variables. Mental health status was evaluated using the depression self-rating scale. Results There is a significant positive effect of intergenerational care on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) people. Additionally, we re-profiled intergenerational care variables by considering the number and length of intergenerational caregivers, and found that the effects remained significant. Furthermore, the effects of intergenerational care vary across subgroups based on gender, age, nature of usual residence, marital status, and physical health status. Finally, we identified two mechanisms through which intergenerational caregiving positively affects mental health: intergenerational financial support and intergenerational spiritual support. Discussion These findings have important implications for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and family members in promoting the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals in China.",Frontiers in Public Health,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",d3dd5449-daa1-4d57-9412-9add6037584f,Frontiers in Public Health,,11,N/A,2023,2023-07-06 00:00:00,8,57,"Xueling Yan, Wenjing Wu, Xiaoqin Chen, Guangming Xu, Shule Yu, Shengyan Li","11529566, 51386990, 2222356812, 46538516, 2116619471, 12373960",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4384215950d7ff91226024d7ac06df15203d239,"Medicine, Sociology",11529566

Active aging needs must be identified to help strategic planning for older adults' health and wellbeing. This study aimed to explore the active aging needs from the perspectives of older adults and geriatric experts. Methods This exploratory-descriptive qualitative study was conducted in four provinces with the oldest populations in Iran. Semi-structured and focus group interviews were conducted with 41 participants (20 older adults and 21 geriatric experts), who were chosen through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were analyzed using the conventional content analysis. Results This study identified three themes and thirteen categories from the data: (1) basic individual needs with three categories of physiological, psycho-emotional, and spiritual needs; and (2) managerial needs with seven categories of political-legal, socio-economic, and cultural-spiritual infrastructures, academic strategies, an age-friendly environment; technological services, and provision of specialized services and daycare for older adults, and (3) educational needs with three categories of training self-care and self-efficacy, empowering the health care workers; and empowering the family.

However, these associations have not been explored using procedures that analyze the sequential effects between risk factors of falling. The present study aimed to examine the effects of muscle strength, agility, and fear of falling on risk of falling using path analysis in community-dwelling older adults. In total, 49 elderly (female = 33, male = 16) participants aged between 65 and 76 years (M = 68.38 years; SD = 6.22) were included for analysis. Muscle strength, agility, fear of falling, and risk of falling were assessed using validated instruments for the older adult population. The proposed model shows that muscle strength was negatively associated with agility. Consequently, agility was negatively associated with fear of falling. The same trend appeared between fear of falling and risk of falling. The effect sizes were between small and medium for agility (R2 = 0.16), fear of falling, (R2 = 0.29), and risk of falling (R2 = 0.03). The main finding of the present study was that muscle strength was significantly correlated with agility, which, in turn, predicted fear of falling. Consequently, lower scores for fear of falling explained lower risk of falling in community-dwelling older adults. While muscle strength is a crucial component of physical fitness, only with adequate levels of agility can older adults possess the efficacy and ability to perform daily tasks.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,20,N/A,2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,22,38,"Filipe Rodrigues, A.

This study systematically retrieved and analyzed articles on the psychological characteristics of older adult victims of online fraud. First, we found that there was no evidence that older adults were more prevalent than other individuals of other ages among online fraud victims, and current researchers have focused more on why older adults are easy targets for fraud (susceptibility to being cheated). Second, research on psychological factors of older adults' susceptibility to online fraud has mainly focused on cognitive function, trust traits, and other personality traits, such as social loneliness, the Big Five personality traits, and self-control. Among them, most researchers claim that the cyber-cheating of older adults may be due to a decline in their cognitive function. However, there has not been a consensus on how cognitive function and physical and mental conditions affect older people who are cheated. Third, techniques (i.e., methods and techniques used by fraudsters) and experience (i.e., familiarity with internet technology or fraud) may be related to the susceptibility of older adults to fraud, and these studies have also not yet generated a consensus supported by reliable data. Based on the above research uncertainties, we propose that fraud prevention and control strategies for older adults should be applied with caution.",Frontiers in Psychology,journal,['Review'],89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06,Frontiers in Psychology,,13,N/A,2022,2022-09-05 00:00:00,26,111,"Yuxi Shang, Zhongxian Wu, Xiaoyu Du, Yanbin Jiang, Beibei Ma, Meihong Chi","2053234722, 2146080353, 2184116979, 2157837903, 2144041057, 2184102909",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9be3b335d559f83cb566d2911b082fa0da1cd059,"Medicine, Psychology",2053234722

Understanding the reasons for the public’s negative opinions towards COVID-19 vaccination using Twitter may help make new headways in improving vaccine uptake. This study, therefore, examined the prevailing negative sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccination via the analysis of public twitter posts over a 16 month period. Original tweets (in English) from 1 April 2021 to 1 August 2022 were extracted. A bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based model was applied, and only negative sentiments tweets were selected. Topic modelling was used, followed by manual thematic analysis performed iteratively by the study investigators, with independent reviews of the topic labels and themes. A total of 4,448,314 tweets were analysed. The analysis generated six topics and three themes related to the prevailing negative sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccination. The themes could be broadly understood as either emotional reactions to perceived invidious policies or safety and effectiveness concerns related to the COVID-19 vaccines.

When the alterations in sleep become substantial, they can generate or accelerate cognitive decline, even in the absence of overt pathology. In fact, impaired sleep represents one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This systematic review aimed to analyze the studies on sleep quality in aging, also considering mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The review process was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. A total of 71 studies were included, and the whole sample had a mean age that ranged from 58.3 to 93.7 years (62.8–93.7 healthy participants and 61.8–86.7 pathological populations). Of these selected studies, 33 adopt subjective measurements, 31 adopt objective measures, and 10 studies used both. Pathological aging showed a worse impoverishment of sleep than older adults, in both subjective and objective measurements. The most common aspect compromised in AD and MCI were REM sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and sleep duration. These results underline that sleep alterations are associated with cognitive impairment.

Objective To ascertain the state of the science on social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions to improve all-hazard household disaster preparedness. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Databases, trial registers, reports, and websites were searched, and citation trails followed utilizing replicable methods. Individual, cluster, and cross-over randomized controlled trials of non-institutionalized, community-dwelling populations and non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after, and program evaluation studies were included. At least two review authors independently screened each potentially relevant study for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane’s RoB2 tool for randomized studies and ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies. Meta-analyses were applied using a random-effects model. Where meta-analysis was not indicated, results were synthesized using summary statistics of intervention effect estimates and vote counting based on effect direction. The evidence was rated using GRADE. Results 17 studies were included with substantial methodological and clinical diversity. No intervention effect was observed for preparedness supplies (OR = 6.12, 95% 0.13 to 284.37) or knowledge (SMD = 0.96, 95% CI −0.15 to 2.08) outcomes. A small positive effect (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91) was observed for preparedness behaviors, with very low certainty of evidence. No studies reported adverse effects from the interventions. Conclusion Research designs elucidating the efficacy of practical yet complex and multi- faceted social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions present substantial methodological challenges where rigorous study design elements may not match the contextual public health priority needs and resources where interventions were delivered. While the overall strength of the evidence was evaluated as low to very low, we acknowledge the valuable and informative work of the included studies. The research represents the seminal work in this field and provides an important foundation for the state of the science of household emergency preparedness intervention effectiveness and efficacy.

How these technology applications identify and engage with the ‘social’ of risk in general and the ‘social’ of risk experienced by marginalized populations is important for EDMPP. Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) and similar phrases are employed as policy concepts to improve research, education, and participation in the workplace for marginalized groups such as women, Indigenous peoples, visible/racialized minorities, disabled people, and LGBTQ2S including in workplaces engaging with EDMPP which includes universities. The aim of this scoping review was to generate data that allows for a detailed understanding of the risk related discussions within the EDMPP academic literature as these discussions shape EDMPP policies and actions. The objective of this scoping review study was to map out the engagement with risk, specifically the social aspects of risk, in the EDMPP-focused academic literature with a focus on (a) EDMPP in general, (b) COVID-19, (c) EDMPP and marginalized groups, (d) EDMPP and patients, and (e) EDMPP and technologies (artificial intelligence, machine learning, machine reasoning, algorithm design approaches such as Bayesian belief networks, e-coaching, decision support systems, virtual coaching, automated decision support, e-mentoring, automated dialogue and conversational agents). Using the academic databases SCOPUS, Web of Sciences, and databases accessible under Compendex and EBSCO-HOST and performing hit count frequency searches of online and downloaded abstracts and thematic analysis of downloaded abstracts the study reveals a lack of coverage on the social aspects of risk and engagement with risk concepts such as risk perception, risk governance, risk literacy, risk communication, risk education and risk narrative especially in conjunction with marginalized groups and technologies employed in EDMPP decision support. Our findings suggest many opportunities to further the EDMPP academic inquiry by filling the gaps.",Sustainability,journal,['Review'],8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,N/A,2022,2022-12-26 00:00:00,13,283,"Brielle Lillywhite, G.

However, understanding their precise roles in diseases remains challenging due to their complex functional mechanisms. Various methodologies have emerged to predict the pathogenic significance of these genetic variants. Typically, these methods employ an integrative approach, leveraging diverse data sources that provide critical insights into genomic function. Despite the abundance of publicly available data sources and databases, the process of navigating, extracting, and pre-processing features for machine learning models can be daunting. Furthermore, researchers often invest substantial effort in feature extraction, only to later discover that these features lack informativeness. Results In this paper, we present DrivR-Base, an innovative resource that efficiently extracts and integrates molecular information (features) for single nucleotide variants from a wide range of databases and tools, including AlphaFold, ENCODE, and Variant Effect Predictor. The resulting features can be used as input for machine learning models designed to predict the pathogenic impact of human genome variants in disease. Moreover, these feature sets have applications beyond this, including haploinsufficiency prediction and the development of drug repurposing tools. We describe the resource’s development, practical applications, and potential for future expansion and enhancement.

Yet, few studies have integrated several multiplexed assays to map variant effects on gene expression in coding sequences. Here, we pioneered a multiplexed assay based on polysome profiling to measure variant effects on translation at scale, uncovering single-nucleotide variants that increase and decrease ribosome load. By combining high-throughput ribosome load data with multiplexed mRNA and protein abundance readouts, we mapped the cis-regulatory landscape of thousands of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) variants from RNA to protein and found numerous coding variants that alter COMT expression. Finally, we trained machine learning models to map signatures of variant effects on COMT gene expression and uncovered both directional and divergent impacts across expression layers. Our analyses reveal expression phenotypes for thousands of variants in COMT and highlight variant effects on both single and multiple layers of expression.

It is also clear that the somatic variants load is greater in aged individuals in comparison to younger ones, pointing to a cause/consequence of the senescence process. More recently, researchers have focused on the role of this type of variation in healthy tissue and its dynamics in cell lineages and different organs. In addition, somatic variants have been described to contribute to monogenic diseases, and the number of evidences of their role in complex disorders is also increasing. Thanks to recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, this type of genetic variation can be now more easily studied than in the past, although we still face some important limitations.

While somatic SNVs near canonical splice sites have been reported to cause abnormal splicing of cancer-related genes, whether these SNVs can affect gene expression through other mechanisms remains an open question. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing and exome data from 4,998 cancer patients covering ten cancer types and identified 152 somatic SNVs near splice sites that were associated with abnormal intronic polyadenylation (IPA). IPA-associated somatic variants favored the localization near the donor splice sites compared to the acceptor splice sites. A proportion of SNV-associated IPA events overlapped with premature cleavage and polyadenylation events triggered by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) inhibition. GC content, intron length and polyadenylation signal were three genomic features that differentiated between SNV-associated IPA and intron retention. Notably, IPA-associated SNVs were enriched in tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including the well-known TSGs such as PTEN and CDH1 with recurrent SNV-associated IPA events. Minigene assay confirmed that SNVs from PTEN, CDH1, VEGFA, GRHL2, CUL3 and WWC2 could lead to IPA.

Various bioinformatics methods have attempted to solve this complex task. In this study, we investigate the assumptions on which these methods are based, showing that the different definitions of driver and passenger variants influence the difficulty of the prediction task. More importantly, we prove that the data sets have a construction bias which prevents the machine learning (ML) methods to actually learn variant-level functional effects, despite their excellent performance. This effect results from the fact that in these data sets, the driver variants map to a few driver genes, while the passenger variants spread across thousands of genes, and thus just learning to recognize driver genes provides almost perfect predictions. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel data set that minimizes this bias by ensuring that all genes covered by the data contain both driver and passenger variants. As a result, we show that the tested predictors experience a significant drop in performance, which should not be considered as poorer modeling, but rather as correcting unwarranted optimism. Finally, we propose a weighting procedure to completely eliminate the gene effects on such predictions, thus precisely evaluating the ability of predictors to model the functional effects of single variants, and we show that indeed this task is still open.",BMC Biology,journal,['JournalArticle'],1617f5c3-5410-462d-91c9-7aa8ced2d91d,BMC Biology,,19,N/A,2021,2021-01-13 00:00:00,19,57,"D.

Recently, we proposed CScape, a method for discriminating between cancer driver mutations and presumed benign variants. For the neutral class, this method relied on benign germline variants found in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Discrimination could, therefore, be influenced by the distinction of germline versus somatic, rather than neutral versus disease driver. This motivates this article in which we consider predictive discrimination between recurrent and rare somatic single point mutations based solely on using cancer data, and the distinction between these two somatic classes and germline single point mutations. Results For somatic point mutations in coding and non-coding regions of the genome, we propose CScape-somatic, an integrative classifier for predictively discriminating between recurrent and rare variants in the human cancer genome. In this study, we use purely cancer genome data and investigate the distinction between minimal occurrence and significantly recurrent somatic single point mutations in the human cancer genome. We show that this type of predictive distinction can give novel insight, and may deliver more meaningful prediction in both coding and non-coding regions of the cancer genome. Tested on somatic mutations, CScape-somatic outperforms alternative methods, reaching 74% balanced accuracy in coding regions and 69% in non-coding regions, whereas even higher accuracy may be achieved using thresholds to isolate high-confidence predictions.

Here, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing (average read depth 584×) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation and matched blood samples from 52 patients with AD and 11 individuals not affected by AD. The number of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in AD brain specimens increases significantly with aging, and the rate of mutation accumulation in the brain is 4.8-fold slower than that in AD blood. The putatively pathogenic brain somatic mutations identified in 26.9% (14 of 52) of AD individuals are enriched in PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway genes known to contribute to hyperphosphorylation of tau. We show that a pathogenic brain somatic mutation in PIN1 leads to a loss-of-function mutation.

The vibration of the in-core sensors near their nominal locations is a new problem for neutronic field reconstruction. Current field-reconstruction methods fail to handle spatially moving sensors. In this study, we propose a Voronoi tessellation technique in combination with convolutional neural networks to handle this challenge. Observations from movable in-core sensors were projected onto the same global field structure using Voronoi tessellation, holding the magnitude and location information of the sensors. General convolutional neural networks were used to learn maps from observations to the global field. The proposed method reconstructed multi-physics fields (including fast flux, thermal flux, and power rate) using observations from a single field (such as thermal flux). Numerical tests based on the IAEA benchmark demonstrated the potential of the proposed method in practical engineering applications, particularly within an amplitude of 5 cm around the nominal locations, which led to average relative errors below 5% and 10% in the $$L_2$$

Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the research on early warning and prediction of agricultural futures price. For the prediction of futures price, there are two kinds of common models: one is the traditional classic time series model, and the other is the neural network model under the wave of artificial intelligence. This paper selects the 1976 closing data of agricultural futures index from January 10, 2012, to February 27, 2020, and uses the time series differential autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA model) and long short-term memory model (LSTM model) to study this work, respectively, and compares the predicted effects of the two models in some metrics. Based on the predicted results of the two models, a simple trading strategy is established, and the trading effects of the two models are compared. The results show that the LSTM model has obvious advantage over ARIMA time series model in the price index prediction of agricultural futures market.",Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],f32b7322-b69c-4e63-801d-8f50784ef778,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,2021,N/A,2021,2021-10-31 00:00:00,11,39,"Shijun Chen, Xiaoli Han, Yunbin Shen, Chong Ye","2110758560, 2149248380, 1845786937, 114665021",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a248b5f208ed597f2ee2aad6c2a15e23f631e64d,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science, Economics, Medicine",2110758560

Occurrences and numbers of insects can be monitored through insect traps, which include their permanent touring and checking of their condition. Another more efficient way is to set up sensor devices with a camera at the traps that will photograph the traps and forward the images to the Internet, where the pest insect’s appearance will be predicted by image analysis. Weather conditions, temperature and relative humidity are the parameters that affect the appearance of some pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera. This paper presents a model of machine learning that can predict the appearance of insects during a season on a daily basis, taking into account the air temperature and relative humidity. Several machine learning algorithms for classification were applied and their accuracy for the prediction of insect occurrence was presented (up to 76.5%). Since the data used for testing were given in chronological order according to the days when the measurement was performed, the existing model was expanded to take into account the periods of three and five days. The extended method showed better accuracy of prediction and a lower percentage of false detections. In the case of a period of five days, the accuracy of the affected detections was 86.3%, while the percentage of false detections was 11%. The proposed model of machine learning can help farmers to detect the occurrence of pests and save the time and resources needed to check the fields.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,44,40,"D.

However, the most common methods to assess aroma are based on expensive equipment or human senses through sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and requires highly trained assessors to avoid subjectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the coffee intensity and aromas using a low-cost and portable electronic nose (e-nose) and machine learning modeling. For this purpose, triplicates of nine commercial coffee samples with different intensity levels were used for this study. Two machine learning models were developed based on artificial neural networks using the data from the e-nose as inputs to (i) classify the samples into low, medium, and high-intensity (Model 1) and (ii) to predict the relative abundance of 45 different aromas (Model 2). Results showed that it is possible to estimate the intensity of coffees with high accuracy (98%; Model 1), as well as to predict the specific aromas obtaining a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99), and no under- or over-fitting of the models were detected. The proposed contactless, nondestructive, rapid, reliable, and low-cost method showed to be effective in evaluating volatile compounds in coffee, which is a potential technique to be applied within all stages of the production process to detect any undesirable characteristics on–time and ensure high-quality products.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-03-01 00:00:00,65,67,"Claudia Gonzalez Viejo, E.

The classic monitoring approach of insect pests is based on placing in single infested areas a series of traps that are checked by human operators on a temporal basis. This strategy requires high labor cost and provides poor spatial and temporal resolution achievable by single operators. The adoption of image sensors to monitor insect pests can result in several practical advantages. The purpose of this review is to summarize the progress made on automatic traps with a particular focus on camera-equipped traps. The use of software and image recognition algorithms can support automatic trap usage to identify and/or count insect species from pictures. Considering the high image resolution achievable and the opportunity to exploit data transfer systems through wireless technology, it is possible to have remote control of insect captures, limiting field visits. The availability of real-time and on-line pest monitoring systems from a distant location opens the opportunity for measuring insect population dynamics constantly and simultaneously in a large number of traps with a limited human labor requirement. The actual limitations are the high cost, the low power autonomy and the low picture quality of some prototypes together with the need for further improvements in fully automated pest detection. Limits and benefits resulting from several case studies are examined with a perspective for the future development of technology-driven insect pest monitoring and management.",Journal of Pest Science,Unknown,['Review'],Unknown,Journal of Pest Science,203 - 217,94,Unknown,2020,2020-12-04 00:00:00,144,80,"M.

The evolution of the activities of the GSC over this period has been driven by evolving geographic, economic and political contexts and needs. Likewise, new technologies and evolving scientific methods and models shaped broadly the successive generations of GSC geoscience activities. The most recent GSC generation presented a mixed portfolio of large framework mapping geoscience programmes, and more targeted, hypothesis-driven geoscience research, and the development of decision support products for a range of government, industry and other stakeholders needs. Entering its eighth generation, the GSC and related organizations are embracing digital technologies for applications such as the evaluation of mineral resource potential, the evaluation of risks and the early warning of earthquakes. In order to do so, the GSC will need to develop new methods and systems in co-operation with other geological survey organizations, and target its data acquisition and research to further advance its ability to respond to the evolving needs of society to navigate geology through space and time, from the past to the present, and from the present to the future.",Special Publications,Unknown,['Review'],Unknown,Special Publications,49 - 68,499,Unknown,2019,2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,35,D.

In IIoT, many sensors, actuators, and other devices are used to improve industrial efficiency. As most of the devices are mobile; therefore, the impact of mobility can be seen in terms of low-device utilization. Thus, most of the time, the available resources are underutilized. Therefore, the inception of the fog computing model in IIoT has reduced the communication delay in executing complex tasks. However, it is not feasible to cover the entire region through fog nodes; therefore, fog node selection and placement is still the challenging task. This paper proposes a multi-level hierarchical fog node deployment model for the industrial environment. Moreover, the scheme utilized the IoT devices as a fog node; however, the selection depends on energy, path/location, network properties, storage, and available computing resources. Therefore, the scheme used the location-aware module before engaging the device for task computation. The framework is evaluated in terms of memory, CPU, scalability, and system efficiency; also compared with the existing approach in terms of task acceptance rate. The scheme is compared with xFogSim framework that is capable to handle workload upto 1000 devices. However, the task acceptance ratio is higher in the proposed framework due to its multi-tier model. The workload acceptance ratio is 85% reported with 3000 devices; whereas, in xFogsim the ratio is reduced to approx. 68%. The primary reason for high workload acceptation is that the proposed solution utilizes the unused resources of the user devices for computations.",Journal of Cloud Computing,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Journal of Cloud Computing,1-17,11,Unknown,2022,2022-10-28 00:00:00,19,55,"Tariq Qayyum, Z.

It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world's population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.",Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",2ca1e2ac-8c3b-4251-94ed-24846d391d3b,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,,2022,N/A,2022,2022-01-20 00:00:00,53,84,"Milind Natu, M.

We sought to examine perceptions of palliative care among patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. Methods: After conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial of early palliative care versus standard care for patients with advanced cancer, we approached patients and their caregivers to participate in semistructured interviews seeking to assess, qualitatively, their attitudes and perceptions about palliative care. We used the grounded theory method for data collection and analysis. Results: A total of 48 patients (26 intervention, 22 control) and 23 caregivers (14 intervention, 9 control) completed interviews. Participants’ initial perceptions of palliative care in both trial arms were of death, hopelessness, dependency and end-of-life comfort care for inpatients. These perceptions provoked fear and avoidance, and often originated from interactions with health care professionals. During the trial, those in the intervention arm developed a broader concept of palliative care as “ongoing care” that improved their “quality of living” but still felt that the term itself carried a stigma. Participants in the intervention group emphasized the need for palliative care to be reframed and better explained by health care professionals. Participants in the control group generally considered it pointless to rename palliative care, but many in the intervention group stated emphatically that a different name was necessary in the early outpatient setting. Interpretation: There is a strong stigma attached to palliative care, which may persist even after positive experiences with an early palliative care intervention. Education of the public, patients and health care providers is paramount if early integration of palliative care is to be successful.",Canadian Medical Association Journal,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Canadian Medical Association Journal,E217 - E227,188,Unknown,2016,2016-04-18 00:00:00,315,41,"C.

It is crucial to detect and patch vulnerabilities before attacks happen. However, existing vulnerability detection methods suffer from long-term dependency, out of vocabulary, bias towards global features or local features, and coarse detection granularity. This paper proposes an automatic vulnerability detection framework in source code based on a hybrid neural network. First, the inputs are transformed into an intermediate representation with explicit structure information using lower level virtual machine intermediate representation (LLVM IR) and backward program slicing. After the transformation, the size of samples and the size of vocabulary are significantly reduced. A hybrid neural network model is then applied to extract high-level features of vulnerability, which learns features both from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The former is applied to learn local vulnerability features, such as buffer size. Furthermore, the latter is utilized to learn global features, such as data dependency. The extracted features are made up of concatenated outputs of CNN and RNN. Experiments are performed to validate our vulnerability detection method. The results show that our proposed method achieves excellent results with F1-scores of 98.6% and accuracy of 99.0% on the SARD dataset. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,3201,11,N/A,2021,2021-04-02 00:00:00,27,47,"Xin Li, Lu Wang, Yang Xin, Yixian Yang, Qi Tang, Yuling Chen","2153900482, 2153518398, 34811223, 47796563, 2069578129, 49069825",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac701065bdcff3322e4ea8b8a4e2a6df0fe831b1,Computer Science,2153900482

3e8056466cd94a05011a683b22b742b61a2c052f,10.1155/2013/350358,Computational Systems Biology,"The complex biological systems consist of distinct molecules that exert their functions by interacting with each other, which makes it a big challenge to understand how the cellular machinery works. Recently, the accumulation of a large amount of multiscale omics data, such as next-generation sequencing data and protein interaction data, provides opportunity to investigate the functions of molecules from a systematic perspective. On the other hand, the analysis of these huge datasets demands efficient and robust computational methods. In this special issue, we reported the recent progress made in developing new computational methodologies to analyze the genomics data, construct gene networks, and identify disease genes. 
 
Understanding the Functions of Molecules in the Postgenomic Age. In recent years, the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology makes it more easier for researchers to access and analyze genetics data and has influential effects on the biomedical research community. However, compared with sequencing, computational analysis of the flooding sequencing data with appropriate tools is becoming a more important task when interpreting the data. In their review paper, M. P. Dolled-Filhart et al. described the pipeline for bioinformatics analysis of the NGS data, starting from alignment to variant calling as well as filtering and annotation. In each step, they discussed the tools or software that should be used as well as their advantages and caveats. This survey of the bioinformatics analysis of NGS data can help researchers to choose appropriate tools when dealing with the sequencing data. 
 
Along with the sequencing technology, lines of evidence show that a lot of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes. Unlike the protein-coding genes that are well studied, the functions of most ncRNAs are not clear. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop computational methods to predict the functions of the ncRNAs. H. Ma et al. conducted a survey about the computational approaches developed to predict and annotate the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which can help researchers to learn the progress in this filed and future directions in which bioinformaticists should work while annotating lncRNAs. 
 
While annotating the functions of molecules, standard and controlled vocabularies are required. Hence, the ontologies that are represented as abstract description systems of knowledge are becoming more and more popular recently. At the same time, it is becoming a difficult task to calculate the semantic similarity between ontology terms quantitatively. M. Gan et al. introduced popular methods in quantitating the semantic similarity between ontology terms and their software implementations. Furthermore, they classified these methods into distinct categories and discussed their advantages and shortcomings, which can help researchers to select appropriate tools and methods when working on ontologies. 
 
Gene expression profiles can describe the molecular mechanisms that underlie certain phenotypes. However, while analyzing the gene expression data, it is inappropriate to treat genes independently considering genes interact with each other within the cell. O. Frings et al. proposed a network-based approach to analyze the gene expression data and applied it to investigate the development of sex-specific chicken gonad and brain tissues. By combining the chicken network and the gene expression data, they identified some sex-biased characteristics, for example, same sex-biased genes tend to be tightly connected in the network, and provided new insights into the molecular underpinnings of sex-biased genes. 
 
Construction and Analysis of Gene Networks. Construction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a crucial step in systems biology, where gene expression data is widely explored to infer the GRNs. However, the high dimensionality and notorious noise of the gene expression data makes it a nontrivial task to infer the GRNs. N. You et al. presented a new Laplace error penalty (LEP) model to calculate the partial correlation coefficients between genes and construct the GRNs. Compared with the popular least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) approaches, the LEP method reached the highest precision. Except for gene expression data, integration of different data sources may improve the accuracy of inferred GRNs. H. Chen et al. surveyed the strategies to integrate distinct data sources and their effectiveness and recommended how to choose an appropriate strategy while integrating distinct data sources. N. Nakajima et al. proposed a novel network completion approach, DPLSQ, to infer gene networks. Benchmarking on artificial datasets, their proposed DPLSQ outperforms popular ARACNE and GeneNet with the highest accuracy. By investigating a 2-gene network, A. V. Spirov et al. found that gene cooption can affect the robustness of GRNs, and the findings provide new insights into the evolvability and robustness of GRNs. 
 
Network modules are found to be functional blocks of gene networks, the identification of which is becoming a hot research topic. By taking the hierarchical modular structure into account, S. Zhang presented a new stochastic block model to detect the hierarchical modules. Applied to the real yeast gene coexpression network, the proposed method can efficiently detect the hierarchical modular structures that are consistent with biological functions. Recently, it is found that a particular type of ncRNAs, microRNAs, plays important roles in gene regulation by working together with transcription factors. W. Mu et al. proposed a new local genetic algorithm to predict condition-specific regulatory modules that consist of microRNAs, transcription factors, and their commonly regulated genes, and these modules provide useful insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression. 
 
Computational Approaches to Hunting Disease-Associated Genes. The identification of genetic variants that are responsible for human diseases is critical for understanding the development of diseases and designing new effective drugs. Thanks to the genome-wide association studies (GWASs), some genetic variants that drive diseases have been identified, among which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are receiving more and more attention. In this issue, J. Wu and R. Jiang reviewed the databases that collect nsSNPs and summarized popular computational methods that identify deleterious nsSNPs. In addition, they introduced machine learning models that are useful in predicting deleterious nsSNPs. Beyond SNP-based association analysis, gene-based association analysis is receiving increasing attention. X. Guo et al. comprehensively compared these two approaches on the data from the study of addiction and found that these two approaches complement with each other and can get better results when used together. 
 
The differentially expressed genes identified from microarray data are generally regarded as candidate disease genes. However, the number of differentially expressed genes may reach hundreds or even thousands, thereby making it difficult to identify the potential disease genes. In this issue, L. Li et al. proposed a new hybrid approach to predict disease genes based on estimation of distribution algorithm and support vector machine. Benchmarking on B-cell lymphoma and colon cancer datasets, their method outperforms two other popular approaches and identify some new candidate genes for future validation.",TheScientificWorldJournal,Unknown,"['Editorial', 'Review']",Unknown,The Scientific World Journal,,2013,Unknown,2013,2013-03-12 00:00:00,653,0,"Xingming Zhao, Weidong Tian, R.

The fatigue crack growth life of metal matrix composites (MMCs) is estimated based on an improved Paris formula. Considering the different expansion coefficient of different materials, the unequal shrinkage will lead to residual stress when the composite is molded and cooled. The crack growth model is improved by the modified stress ratio based on residual stress. The Dijkstra algorithm is introduced to avoid the cracks passing through the strengthening base and the characteristics of crack steps. This model can be extended to predict crack growth length for other similarly-structured composite materials. The shortest path of crack growth is simulated by using path planning algorithm, and the fatigue life of composites is calculated based on the shortest path and improved model. And the residual stress caused by temperature change is considered to improve the fatigue crack growth model in the material. The improved model can well predict the fatigue life curve of composites. By analyzing the fatigue life of composites, it is found that there is a certain regularity based on metal materials, and the new fatigue prediction model can also reflect this regularity.",Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering,journal,,672d5dd9-8192-4f70-9aee-52fc9cf99820,Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering,1-12,36,N/A,2023,2023-02-20 00:00:00,5,44,"Wenqian Shang, Xintian Liu, Xu Wang, Xiaolan Wang","2066300123, 1857224, 2108599873, 50141927",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc9b7bf86a8f750fff4c019fd3ae599389cb7a99,"Engineering, Materials Science",2066300123

Thanks to these fortunate characteristics, this type of motor has various applications in high-tech industries. However, since BLDC motors are often required to operate at high-speed rotations and under extreme conditions, temperature overshoots can appear during operation, provoking damage to the windings. The purpose of this review is to present the results of a recent investigation and recollection of different methods used for the diagnosis of electrical faults in the stator, such as turn-to-turn short circuits, coil-to-coil short circuits, phase-to-phase short circuits and phase open circuits. In particular, this review presents an analysis of the available diagnosis methods according to the type of fault, the method or technique used for the diagnosis, the evaluated physical variables and the context in which the methods were evaluated (in simulations or in experimental tests). Based on this analysis, the following classifications of diagnostic methods are proposed: signal-based, model-based and data-based methods.

Despite its relatively late formation and persistent developmental changes, the GABAergic system promotes the ordered shaping of neuronal circuits at the structural and functional levels. Within this frame, interneurons participate first in spontaneous and later in sensory-evoked activity patterns that precede cortical functions of the mature brain. Upon their subcortical generation, interneurons in the embryonic brain must first orderly migrate to and settle in respective target layers before they can actively engage in cortical network activity. During this process, changes at the molecular and synaptic level of interneurons allow not only their coordinated formation but also the pruning of connections as well as excitatory and inhibitory synapses. At the postsynaptic site, the shift of GABAergic signaling from an excitatory towards an inhibitory response is required to enable synchronization within cortical networks. Concomitantly, the progressive specification of different interneuron subtypes endows the neocortex with distinct local cortical circuits and region-specific modulation of neuronal firing. Finally, the apoptotic process further refines neuronal populations by constantly maintaining a controlled ratio of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Interestingly, many of these fundamental and complex processes are influenced—if not directly controlled—by electrical activity. Interneurons on the subcellular, cellular, and network level are affected by high frequency patterns, such as spindle burst and gamma oscillations in rodents and delta brushes in humans. Conversely, the maturation of interneuron structure and function on each of these scales feeds back and contributes to the generation of cortical activity patterns that are essential for the proper peri- and postnatal development.

An intriguing question is how physiological neuronal activity modifies the expression of these molecules in developing cortical networks. Here, we addressed this issue, focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the factors underlying cortical wiring. Real-time imaging of BDNF promoter activity in organotypic slice cultures revealed that patterned stimuli differentially regulated the increase and the time course of the promoter activity in upper layer neurons. Calcium imaging further demonstrated that stimulus-dependent increases in the promoter activity were roughly proportional to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration per unit time. Finally, optogenetic stimulation showed that the promoter activity was increased efficiently by patterned stimulation in defined cortical circuits. These results suggest that physiological stimulation patterns differentially tune activity-dependent gene expression in developing cortical neurons via cortical circuits, synaptic responses, and alteration of intracellular calcium signaling.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],2ca4279c-8ed7-4280-8022-09e577923a09,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,15,N/A,2021,2021-12-10 00:00:00,15,80,"Yumi Miyasaka, N.

During early development, cortical cultures exhibit a wide repertoire of synchronous bursting dynamics whose characterization may help to understand the parameters governing the transition from immature to mature networks. Here we used machine learning techniques to characterize and predict the developing spontaneous activity in mouse cortical neurons on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) during the first three weeks in vitro. Network activity at three stages of early development was defined by 18 electrophysiological features of spikes, bursts, synchrony, and connectivity. The variability of neuronal network activity during early development was investigated by applying k-means and self-organizing map (SOM) clustering analysis to features of bursts and synchrony. These electrophysiological features were predicted at the third week in vitro with high accuracy from those at earlier times using three machine learning models: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. Our results indicate that initial patterns of electrical activity during the first week in vitro may already predetermine the final development of the neuronal network activity. The methodological approach used here may be applied to explore the biological mechanisms underlying the complex dynamics of spontaneous activity in developing neuronal cultures.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,N/A,2021,2021-10-14 00:00:00,15,66,"D.

This process is attenuated by increased levels of neuronal activity and enhanced by suppression of activity. To uncover whether the mere level of activity or also the temporal structure of electrical activity affects neuronal death rates, we optogenetically controlled spontaneous activity of synaptically-isolated neurons in developing cortical cultures. Our results demonstrate that action potential firing of primary cortical neurons promotes neuronal survival throughout development. Chronic patterned optogenetic stimulation allowed to effectively modulate the firing pattern of single neurons in the absence of synaptic inputs while maintaining stable overall activity levels. Replacing the burst firing pattern with a non-physiological, single pulse pattern significantly increased cell death rates as compared to physiological burst stimulation. Furthermore, physiological burst stimulation led to an elevated peak in intracellular calcium and an increase in the expression level of classical activity-dependent targets but also decreased Bax/BCL-2 expression ratio and reduced caspase 3/7 activity. In summary, these results demonstrate at the single-cell level that the temporal pattern of action potentials is critical for neuronal survival versus cell death fate during cortical development, besides the pro-survival effect of action potential firing per se.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,22,N/A,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,14,73,"I.

Sleep spindles can be detected in EEG, however, identifying sleep spindles in EEG recordings manually is very time-consuming and typically requires highly trained experts. Research on the automatic detection of sleep spindles in infant EEGs has been limited to-date. In this study, we present a novel supervised machine learning-based algorithm to detect sleep spindles in infant EEG recordings. EEGs collected from 141 ex-term born infants and 6 ex-preterm born infants, recorded at 4 months of age (adjusted), were used to train and test the algorithm. Sleep spindles were annotated by experienced clinical physiologists as the gold standard. The dataset was split into training (81 ex-term), validation (30 ex-term), and testing (30 ex-term + 6 ex-preterm) set. 15 features were selected for input into a random forest algorithm. Sleep spindles were detected in the ex-term infant EEG test set with 92.1% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity. For ex-preterm born infants, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.3% and 91.8% respectively.

Along this journey, Digital Twin has been introduced to the industry as a concept that holds the promise to challenge the status-quo and address long standing problems of productivity, efficiency, and value. While this concept is becoming more familiar among practitioners, there is a lack of universal definitions of what the Digital Twin of a construction project is. Additionally, while identifying the purpose of Digital Twin is recognized as the first step in implementing Digital Twins, there is little discussion on the perception of construction practitioners of the extent to which Digital Twin can deliver value. To address these research gaps and building on the existing work on Digital Twins in the context of the construction industry, this paper first proposes a definition of the Digital Twin of a construction project. Next, a series of semi-structured interviews are conducted with nine construction practitioners to understand their perceptions on the use and challenges of Digital Twins. Thematic analysis is then used to analyze interview data and summarize Digital Twins applications, capabilities, and challenges. Forty direct applications were identified and grouped into seven capabilities. Digital Twins capabilities of Increase Transparency of Information and Real-Time Monitoring, Analysis, and Feedback were the most discussed with a total of eight applications each, followed by Better Stakeholder Collaboration which had seven applications. The discussion on challenges led to the identification of 34 challenges to implementing Digital Twin, grouped into six categories coded through thematic analysis. The category on Data Understanding, Preparation, and Usage Challenges was found to be the most critical for the interviewees. Additionally, the paper presents a case study on how building authority can be integrated into Digital Twins and leverage its use throughout the lifecycle of a building. Future work can further investigate the challenges and develop prototypes that can help in quantifying the benefits of implementing Digital Twins on a Construction Project.",Frontiers in Built Environment,journal,,d44a90af-d645-4877-9b98-d89aedc53d99,,,8,N/A,2022,2022-06-13 00:00:00,51,80,"Ashtarout Ammar, Hala Nassereddine, Nadine AbdulBaky, Anwar AbouKansour, Juliano Tannoury, H.

Because of the complexity and non-linearity, a visual interpretation of FHR signals using common guidelines usually results in significant subjective inter-observer and intra-observer variability. Objective: Therefore, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology have recently been developed to assist obstetricians in making objective medical decisions.MethodsIn this work, we present an 8-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to automatically predict fetal acidemia. After signal preprocessing, the input 2-dimensional (2D) images are obtained using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which provides a better way to observe and capture the hidden characteristic information of the FHR signals in both the time and frequency domains. Unlike the conventional machine learning (ML) approaches, this work does not require the execution of complex feature engineering, i.e., feature extraction and selection. In fact, 2D CNN model can self-learn useful features from the input data with the prerequisite of not losing informative features, representing the tremendous advantage of deep learning (DL) over ML.ResultsBased on the test open-access database (CTU-UHB), after comprehensive experimentation, we achieved better classification performance using the optimal CNN configuration compared to other state-of-the-art methods: the averaged ten-fold cross-validation of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, quality index defined as the geometric mean of the sensitivity and specificity, and the area under the curve yielded results of 98.34, 98.22, 94.87, 96.53 and 97.82%, respectivelyConclusionsOnce the proposed CNN model is successfully trained, the corresponding CAD system can be served as an effective tool to predict fetal asphyxia objectively and accurately.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,journal,['JournalArticle'],76da9cc5-c5a7-42b4-a250-3e708c5f4980,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,19,N/A,2019,2019-12-01 00:00:00,103,58,"Zhidong Zhao, Yanjun Deng, Yang Zhang, Yefei Zhang, Xiaohong Zhang, Lihuan Shao","2673242, 5513943, 2145955724, 2115892668, 2108583979, 30658926",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3f31f9f34df9962c0ef24a8d9c2067a04127708,"Computer Science, Medicine",2673242

Intrapartum complications are one of the major causes of perinatal mortality. Fetal cardiotocograph (CTGs) can be used as a monitoring tool to identify high-risk women during labor. Aim: The objective of this study was to study the precision of machine learning algorithm techniques on CTG data in identifying high-risk fetuses. Methods: CTG data of 2126 pregnant women were obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Ten different machine learning classification models were trained using CTG data. Sensitivity, precision, and F1 score for each class and overall accuracy of each model were obtained to predict normal, suspect, and pathological fetal states. Model with best performance on specified metrics was then identified. Results: Determined by obstetricians' interpretation of CTGs as gold standard, 70% of them were normal, 20% were suspect, and 10% had a pathological fetal state. On training data, the classification models generated by XGBoost, decision tree, and random forest had high precision (>96%) to predict the suspect and pathological state of the fetus based on the CTG tracings. However, on testing data, XGBoost model had the highest precision to predict a pathological fetal state (>92%). Conclusion: The classification model developed using XGBoost technique had the highest prediction accuracy for an adverse fetal outcome. Lay health-care workers in low- and middle-income countries can use this model to triage pregnant women in remote areas for early referral and further management.",International Journal of Applied and Basic Medical Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],d7dc05be-d184-41e5-bcb2-9060c5fbe959,International Journal of Applied and Basic Medical Research,226 - 230,9,N/A,2019,2019-10-01 00:00:00,52,24,"Zahra Hoodbhoy, Mohammad Noman, Ayesha Shafique, A.

However, the lack of regularly updated, continental-scale, and high spatial resolution (30 m) land cover data limit our ability to better understand the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of land surface changes. Despite the free availability of high spatial resolution Landsat satellite data, continental-scale land cover mapping using high resolution Landsat satellite data was not feasible until now due to the need for high-performance computing to store, process, and analyze this large volume of high resolution satellite data. In this study, we present an approach to quantify continental land cover and impervious surface changes over a long period of time (15 years) using high resolution Landsat satellite observations and Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The approach applied here to overcome the computational challenges of handling big earth observation data by using cloud computing can help scientists and practitioners who lack high-performance computational resources.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,12,N/A,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,142,41,"Alemayehu Midekisa, Felix Holl, David J.

In this paper, in order to classify electrical faults in radial distribution systems, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based support vector machine (SVM) classifier has been proposed. The proposed PSO based SVM classifier is able to select appropriate input features and optimize SVM parameters to increase classification accuracy. Further, a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method with a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) stimulus has been used to generate a dataset for purposes of classification. The proposed technique has been tested on a typical radial distribution network to identify ten different types of faults considering 12 given input features generated by using Simulink software and MATLAB Toolbox. The success rate of the SVM classifier is over 97%, which demonstrates the effectiveness and high efficiency of the developed method.",Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],f32b7322-b69c-4e63-801d-8f50784ef778,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,2017,N/A,2017,2017-07-11 00:00:00,62,36,"M.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of concerns associated with AI fairness; discuss strategies to mitigate AI biases; and emphasize the need for cooperation among physicians, AI researchers, AI developers, policymakers, and patients to ensure equitable AI integration. First, we define and introduce the concept of fairness in AI applications in healthcare and radiology, emphasizing the benefits and challenges of incorporating AI into clinical practice. Next, we delve into concerns regarding fairness in healthcare, addressing the various causes of biases in AI and potential concerns such as misdiagnosis, unequal access to treatment, and ethical considerations. We then outline strategies for addressing fairness, such as the importance of diverse and representative data and algorithm audits. Additionally, we discuss ethical and legal considerations such as data privacy, responsibility, accountability, transparency, and explainability in AI. Finally, we present the Fairness of Artificial Intelligence Recommendations in healthcare (FAIR) statement to offer best practices.

They employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to allow a local passive adversary to uncover the Web browsing behavior of a user, even if she browses through an encrypted tunnel (e.g. Tor, VPN). Numerous defenses have been proposed in the past; however, it is typically difficult to have formal guarantees on their security, which is most often evaluated empirically against state-of-the-art attacks. In this paper, we present a practical method to derive security bounds for any WF defense, where the bounds depend on a chosen feature set. This result derives from reducing WF attacks to an ML classification task, where we can determine the smallest achievable error (the Bayes error). Such error can be estimated in practice, and is a lower bound for a WF adversary, for any classification algorithm he may use. Our work has two main consequences: i) it allows determining the security of WF defenses, in a black-box manner, with respect to the state-of-the-art feature set and ii) it favors shifting the focus of future WF research to identifying optimal feature sets. The generality of this approach further suggests that the method could be used to define security bounds for other ML-based attacks.",Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,,['JournalArticle'],d5dc4224-e4c3-43c9-918a-bd6326650b5b,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,215 - 231,2017,Unknown,2017,2017-02-24 00:00:00,37,37,Giovanni Cherubin,2591635,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f0afe85012146ba0791eff4f0075494a53534fe,Computer Science,2591635

Numerical simulations using a two-dimensional axisymmetric multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation are employed to obtain the data of fluid density. Using the data of fluid density and nodal coordinates, the gradients of fluid density are determined and then used to generate numerical schlieren images. Based on these images, the triple point paths are derived and compared with the models of the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) as well as two models from the open literature. It is found that the numerically derived triple point paths are in good agreement with those predicted by a recently published model in the open literature for the typical ground range of shock wave propagation of up to 6 m. Considering the whole distance range, it is found that the agreement of different models of the triple point path with the numerical ones depends on the considered blast scenario, i.e., the scaled charge height. For small-scaled charge heights, the model of the UFC and the recently published model in the open literature are in better agreement with the numerical results than the other two models, whereas the NRDC model has the best agreement with the numerical results for large-scaled charge heights. Based on the numerical results, a new empirical formula is proposed for the prediction of the triple point path, which is valid for a wide range of the scaled charge heights from 0.5 to 3.5 m/kg1/3 and scaled ground distances up to 15 m/kg1/3.",Shock Waves,journal,,2533aa94-9bb4-4257-981d-475110e7f961,Shock Waves,677 - 686,30,N/A,2020,2020-09-01 00:00:00,17,17,"W.

Machine learning evolved from the study of pattern recognition and explores the notion that algorithms can learn from and make predictions on data. And, as they begin to become more ‘intelligent’, these algorithms can overcome program instructions to make highly accurate, data-driven decisions. Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques (including machine learning, predictive modelling and data mining) and uses statistics (both historical and current) to estimate, or ‘predict’, future outcomes. These outcomes might be behaviors of a customer likely to exhibit or possible changes in the market, for example.

The outcome prediction is a difficult task because there are a lot of factors that can afflict the final results and most of them are related to the player human behaviour. In this paper we propose a new feature set (related to the match and to players) aimed to model a soccer match. The set is related to characteristics obtainable not only at the end of the match, but also when the match is in progress. We consider machine learning techniques to predict the results of the match and the number of goals, evaluating a dataset of real-world data obtained from the Italian Serie A league in the 2017-2018 season. Using the RandomForest algorithm we obtain a precision of 0.857 and a recall of 0.750 in won match prediction, while for the goal prediction we obtain a precision of 0.879 in the number of goal prediction less than two, and a precision of 0.8 in the number of goal prediction equal or greater to two.",International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence,conference,['JournalArticle'],f6b96a8f-dc43-4d21-99cf-0f2532b7f01f,,458-465,,2019f6b96a8f-dc43-4d21-99cf-0f2532b7f01f,2019,2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,22,"Giovanni Capobianco, Umberto Di Giacomo, F.

Through layer-by-layer research, it was found that LRP1B expression in GC was accompanied by a higher-level infiltration of CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163. It is concluded that LRP1B expression can stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration, thus bringing clinical benefits to GC patients. Abstract Background: Recent studies have shown that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1b (LRP1B), as a potential tumor suppressor, is implicated in the response to immunotherapy. The frequency of LRP1B mutation gene is high in many cancers, but its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not been determined. Methods: The prognostic value of LRP1B mutation in a cohort containing 100 patients having received radical gastrectomy for stage II–III GC was explored. By analyzing the data of LRP1B mRNA, the risk score of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LRP1B mutation-type and wild-type was constructed based on the TCGA-STAD cohort. The infiltration of tumor immune cells was evaluated by the CYBERSORT algorithm and verified by immunohistochemistry. Results: LRP1B gene mutation was an independent risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in GC patients (HR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.28–5.14, p = 0.008). The Kaplan–Meier curve demonstrated a shorter survival time in high-risk patients stratified according to risk score (p < 0.0001). CYBERSORT analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly concentrated in CD4+ T cells and macrophages. TIMER analysis suggested that LRP1B expression was associated with the infiltration of CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LRP1B was expressed in the tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells in 16/89 and 26/89 of the cohort, respectively. LRP1B-positive TCs were associated with higher levels of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163 (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that LRP1B-positive TCs represented an independent protective factor of DFS in GC patients (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.10–0.93, p = 0.042). Conclusions: LRP1B has a high prognostic value in GC. LRP1B may stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration to provide GC patients with survival benefits.",Cancers,journal,['JournalArticle'],d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,15,N/A,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,5,43,"Rui Wang, Guangtao Zhang, Xiaohong Zhu, Yan Xu, N.

This study aims to construct a risk model to guide immunotherapy in LUAD patients effectively. Materials and methods LUAD Bulk RNA-seq data for the construction of a model, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (GSE203360) for cell cluster analysis, and microarray data (GSE31210) for validation were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We used the Seurat R package to filter and process scRNA-seq data. Sample clustering was performed in the ConsensusClusterPlus R package. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups were mined by the Limma R package. MCP-counter, CIBERSORT, ssGSEA, and ESTIMATE were employed to evaluate immune characteristics. Stepwise multivariate analysis, Univariate Cox analysis, and Lasso regression analysis were conducted to identify key prognostic genes and were used to construct the risk model. Key prognostic gene expressions were explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. Results A total of 27 immune cell marker genes associated with prognosis were identified for subtyping LUAD samples into clusters C3, C2, and C1. C1 had the longest overall survival and highest immune infiltration among them, followed by C2 and C3. Oncogenic pathways such as VEGF, EFGR, and MAPK were more activated in C3 compared to the other two clusters. Based on the DEGs among clusters, we confirmed seven key prognostic genes including CPA3, S100P, PTTG1, LOXL2, MELTF, PKP2, and TMPRSS11E. Two risk groups defined by the seven-gene risk model presented distinct responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, immune infiltration, and prognosis. The mRNA and protein level of CPA3 was decreased, while the remaining six gene levels were increased in clinical tumor tissues. Conclusion Immune cell markers are effective in clustering LUAD samples into different subtypes, and they play important roles in regulating the immune microenvironment and cancer development. In addition, the seven-gene risk model may serve as a guide for assisting in personalized treatment in LUAD patients.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,14,N/A,2023,2023-07-31 00:00:00,11,50,"Jianfeng Shu, Jinni Jiang, Guofang Zhao","11861590, 2226698163, 12181440",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ab49eabfc27c82e118e73d4fb47456aced25de8,Medicine,11861590

It is imperative to accurately and intelligently select appropriate patients for immunotherapy or predict the immunotherapy efficacy. In recent years, machine learning (ML)-based artificial intelligence (AI) was developed in the area of medical-industrial convergence. AI can help model and predict medical information. A growing number of studies have combined radiology, pathology, genomics, proteomics data in order to predict the expression levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer patients or predict the likelihood of immunotherapy benefits and side effects. Finally, with the advancement of AI and ML, it is believed that ""digital biopsy"" can replace the traditional single assessment method to benefit more cancer patients and help clinical decision-making in the future.

Recently, the rapid development of immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for LUAD patients. Closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment and immune cell functions, more and more new immune checkpoints have been discovered, and various cancer treatment studies targeting these novel immune checkpoints are currently in full swing. However, studies on the phenotype and clinical significance of novel immune checkpoints in LUAD are still limited, and only a minority of patients with LUAD can benefit from immunotherapy. Methods: The LUAD datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, and the immune checkpoints score of each sample were calculated based on the expression of the 82 immune checkpoints-related genes (ICGs). The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to obtain the gene modules closely related to the score and two different LUAD clusters were identified based on these module genes by the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) Algorithm. The differentially expressed genes between the two clusters were further used to construct a predictive signature for prognosis, immune features, and the response to immunotherapy for LUAD patients through a series of regression analyses. Results: A new immune checkpoints-related signature was finally established according to the expression of 7 genes (FCER2, CD200R1, RHOV, TNNT2, WT1, AHSG, and KRTAP5-8). This signature can stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with different survival outcomes and sensitivity to immunotherapy, and the signature has been well validated in different clinical subgroups and validation cohorts. Conclusion: We constructed a novel immune checkpoints-related LUAD risk assessment system, which has a good predictive ability and significance for guiding immunotherapy. We believe that these findings will not only aid in the clinical management of LUAD patients but also provide some insights into screening appropriate patients for immunotherapy.",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,journal,['JournalArticle'],5b97da83-0106-4e9f-aef2-4c3006afbb2c,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,,11,N/A,2023,2023-05-10 00:00:00,6,46,"Linbin Hua, Jiyue Wu, Jiashu Ge, Xin Li, B.

The effects of lipid metabolism on tumor growth have been explored, but the mechanistic details of the association of lipid metabolism disorders with PCa remain largely elusive. Methods The RNA sequencing data of the GSE45604 and The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) datasets were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and UCSC Xena databases, respectively. The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) was utilized to identify lipid metabolism-related genes. The limma R package was used to identify differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related genes (DE-LMRGs) and differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs). Moreover, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) were applied to select signature miRNAs and construct a lipid metabolism-related diagnostic model. The expression levels of selected differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related miRNAs (DE-LMRMs) in PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) specimens were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‒PCR). Furthermore, a transcription factor (TF)-miRNA‒mRNA network was constructed. Eventually, Kaplan‒Meier (KM) curves were plotted to illustrate the associations between signature miRNA-related mRNAs and TFs and overall survival (OS) along with biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCR). Results Forty-seven LMRMs were screened based on the correlation analysis of 29 DE-LMRGs and 56 DEMs, in which 27 LMRMs were stably expressed in the GSE45604 dataset. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and machine learning methods were employed to develop a lipid metabolism-related diagnostic signature, which may be of diagnostic value for PCa patients. qRT‒PCR results showed that all seven key DE-LMRMs were differentially expressed between PCa and BPH tissues. Eventually, a TF-miRNA‒mRNA network was constructed. Conclusions These results suggested that 7 key diagnostic miRNAs were closely related to PCa pathological processes and provided new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of PCa. Moreover, CLIC6 and SCNN1A linked to miR-200c-3p had good prognostic potential and provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of PCa.",Lipids in Health and Disease,journal,['JournalArticle'],eaeef36d-16ae-4b09-a697-254257ed944e,Lipids in Health and Disease,,22,N/A,2023,2023-03-14 00:00:00,7,51,"Tianyuan Zhai, Meng Dou, Yubo Ma, Hong Wang, F.

Accurate suggestions of reaction conditions are required for experimental validation and can have a significant effect on the success or failure of an attempted transformation. However, de novo condition recommendation remains a challenging and under-explored problem and relies heavily on chemists’ knowledge and experience. In this work, we develop a neural-network model to predict the chemical context (catalyst(s), solvent(s), reagent(s)), as well as the temperature most suitable for any particular organic reaction. Trained on ∼10 million examples from Reaxys, the model is able to propose conditions where a close match to the recorded catalyst, solvent, and reagent is found within the top-10 predictions 69.6% of the time, with top-10 accuracies for individual species reaching 80–90%. Temperature is accurately predicted within ±20 °C from the recorded temperature in 60–70% of test cases, with higher accuracy for cases with correct chemical context predictions.

24f33ee8baef7632fcfbd951453cdca761bc6a47,10.2147/HMER.S74612,The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease,"Thrombocytopenia is the most common hematological abnormality encountered in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). In addition to being an indicator of advanced disease and poor prognosis, it frequently prevents crucial interventions. Historically, thrombocytopenia has been attributed to hypersplenism, which is the increased pooling of platelets in a spleen enlarged by congestive splenomegaly secondary to portal hypertension. Over the past decade, however, there have been significant advances in the understanding of thrombopoiesis, which, in turn, has led to an improved understanding of thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis. Multiple factors contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia and these can broadly be divided into those that cause decreased production, splenic sequestration, and increased destruction. Depressed thrombopoietin levels in CLD, together with direct bone marrow suppression, result in a reduced rate of platelet production. Thrombopoietin regulates both platelet production and maturation and is impaired in CLD. Bone marrow suppression can be caused by viruses, alcohol, iron overload, and medications. Splenic sequestration results from hypersplenism. The increased rate of platelet destruction in cirrhosis also occurs through a number of pathways: increased shear stress, increased fibrinolysis, bacterial translocation, and infection result in an increased rate of platelet aggregation, while autoimmune disease and raised titers of antiplatelet immunoglobulin result in the immunologic destruction of platelets. An in-depth understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the thrombocytopenia of CLD is crucial when considering treatment strategies. This review outlines the recent advances in our understanding of thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis and CLD.",Hepatic Medicine : Evidence and Research,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",f9943cca-95da-44eb-bf56-ca4c7e68ecdf,Hepatic Medicine : Evidence and Research,39 - 50,8,N/A,2016,2016-04-15 00:00:00,190,135,"Oscar J L Mitchell, David M.

When reporting overall CS rates, Blacks and other minorities are typically reported to have high CS rates but comparing overall CS rates may be misleading as CS may be more common in some higher risk populations. Improved understanding of how CS rates differ by race among standardized groups could highlight differences in care and areas for improvement. The current study examines racial differences in cesarean section delivery rates using the Robson Ten-Group Classification System in a nationwide sample. Data from US vital statistics live birth certificates were used to identify 3,906,088 births which were each classified into one of the ten groups based on five obstetric characteristics identifiable on presentation for delivery including parity, onset of labor, gestational age, fetal presentation, and number of fetuses. Results indicated that Black and Asian mothers had the highest CS rates in groups 1–4 which all contain single, cephalic pregnancies at term with no prior CS and are only differentiated by parity and onset of labor. Black mothers also had the lowest CS rates for groups 6 and 7, containing women with nulliparous and multiparous breech births. Black and Asian mothers show differences in CS rates among groups that could indicate lack of appropriate care. Efforts should be made to prevent unnecessary primary CS among low-risk mothers.",Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities,journal,['JournalArticle'],f41df924-72aa-40d4-8a9f-c3c8a129c1fb,Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities,844 - 851,8,N/A,2020,2020-08-17 00:00:00,44,43,Elise G.

Furthermore, we investigate a method to counteract the effect of false negative predictions by AI—resulting in an extremely and dangerously long RTAT, as CXRs are sorted to the end of the worklist. We developed a simulation framework that models the current workflow at a university hospital by incorporating hospital-specific CXR generation rates and reporting rates and pathology distribution. Using this, we simulated the standard worklist processing “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) and compared it with a worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was performed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass, and foreign object. Furthermore, we introduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest urgency is assigned to the examination. The average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all prioritization simulations compared to the FIFO simulation (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6 min vs. 80.1 min; p < 0.0001), while the maximum RTAT for most findings increased at the same time (e.g., pneumothorax: 1293 min vs 890 min; p < 0.0001). Our “upper limit” substantially reduced the maximum RTAT in all classes (e.g., pneumothorax: 979 min vs. 1293 min/1178 min; p < 0.0001). Our simulations demonstrate that smart worklist prioritization by AI can reduce the average RTAT for critical findings in CXRs while maintaining a small maximum RTAT as FIFO. • Development of a realistic clinical workflow simulator based on empirical data from a hospital allowed precise assessment of smart worklist prioritization using artificial intelligence. • Employing a smart worklist prioritization without a threshold for maximum waiting time runs the risk of false negative predictions of the artificial intelligence greatly increasing the report turnaround time. • Use of a state-of-the-art convolution neural network can reduce the average report turnaround time almost to the upper limit of a perfect classification algorithm (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6 min vs. 30.4 min).",European Radiology,journal,['JournalArticle'],47f41409-58e8-4cf2-b8cb-2470d27e901a,European Radiology,3837 - 3845,31,N/A,2020,2020-01-23 00:00:00,48,20,"I.

However, it is associated with a higher risk of complications, especially when performed without a clear medical indication. Since labour attendants have no standardised clinical method to assist in this decision, statistical tools developed based on multiple labour variables may be an alternative. The objective of this paper was to develop and evaluate the accuracy of models for caesarean section prediction using maternal and foetal characteristics collected at admission and through labour.MethodThis is a secondary analysis of the World Health Organization’s Better Outcomes in Labour Difficulty prospective cohort study in two sub-Saharan African countries. Data were collected from women admitted for labour and childbirth in 13 hospitals in Nigeria as well as Uganda between 2014 and 2015. We applied logistic regression to develop different models to predict caesarean section, based on the time when intrapartum assessment was made. To evaluate discriminatory capacity of the various models, we calculated: area under the curve, diagnostic accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity.ResultsA total of 8957 pregnant women with 12.67% of caesarean births were used for model development. The model based on labour admission characteristics showed an area under the curve of 78.70%, sensitivity of 63.20%, specificity of 78.68% and accuracy of 76.62%. On the other hand, the models that applied intrapartum assessments performed better, with an area under the curve of 93.66%, sensitivity of 80.12%, specificity of 89.26% and accuracy of 88.03%.ConclusionIt is possible to predict the likelihood of intrapartum caesarean section with high accuracy based on labour characteristics and events. However, the accuracy of this prediction is considerably higher when based on information obtained throughout the course of labour.",Reproductive Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],7eda7c14-9c97-4eac-b0ed-6d00aaf5d80f,Reproductive Health,,16,N/A,2019,2019-11-14 00:00:00,9,41,"H.

Hispanic cesarean rates were higher than non-Hispanic white rates in the US in 2016. In 2009, cesarean rates among Hispanics on the US-Mexico border exceeded rates among US Hispanics. Since 2009, rates have declined nationwide, but border Hispanic rates have not been studied. Objective To compare cesarean delivery rates and trends in Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in border and nonborder counties of the four US border states before and after 2009. Study Design We used data from birth certificates to calculate percentages of cesarean deliveries among all births and births to low-risk nulliparous women during 2000–2015, and among births to low-risk women with and without a previous cesarean during 2009–2015. We calculated 95% confidence intervals around rates and used regular and piecewise linear regression to estimate trends for four ethnic-geographic subpopulations defined by combinations of Hispanic ethnicity and border-nonborder status. Results Of the four subpopulations, border Hispanic rates were highest every year for all cesarean outcomes. In 2015 they were 38.3% overall, 31.4% among low-risk nulliparous women, and 21.1% and 94.6% among low-risk women without and with a previous cesarean, respectively. Nonborder Hispanic rates in 2015 were lowest for all outcomes but repeat cesarean. Rates for all four subpopulations rose steadily during 2000–2009. Unlike rates for non-Hispanic whites, border and nonborder Hispanic rates did not decline post-2009. Most of the border Hispanic excess can be attributed to higher cesarean rates in Texas. Discussion Border Hispanic cesarean rates remain higher than those among other Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in border states and show no signs of declining. This continuing disparity warrants further analysis using individual as well as hospital, environmental and other contextual factors to help target prevention measures.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,13,N/A,2018,2018-09-05 00:00:00,6,31,"Jill A.

Identification of these genes and understanding their functions are critical for further investigation of tumorigenesis. So far, many studies have identified numerous TSGs and illustrated their functions in various types of tumors or normal samples. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs can act as TSGs to prevent the tumorigenesis processes. Therefore, there is a growing demand to integrate TSGs with large-scale experimental evidence (e.g. gene expression and epigenetic signatures) to provide a comprehensive resource for further investigation of TSGs and their molecular mechanisms in cancer. To achieve this goal, we first developed a comprehensive literature-based database called TSGene (tumor suppressor gene database), freely available at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/TSGene/. In the current release, TSGene contains 716 human (637 protein-coding and 79 non-coding genes), 628 mouse and 567 rat TSGs curated from UniProtKB, the Tumor Associated Gene database and 5795 PubMed abstracts.

Zamzama gas field demonstrates the complex nature of lithofacies due to the heterogeneous nature of the reservoir formation, while it is quite challenging to identify the lithofacies. Using our machine learning approach and cluster analysis, we can not only resolve these difficulties, but also minimize their time-consuming aspects and provide an accurate result even when the user is inexperienced. To constrain accurate reservoir models, rock type identification is a critical step in reservoir characterization. Many empirical and statistical methodologies have been established based on the effect of rock type on reservoir performance. Only well-logged data are provided, and no cores are sampled. Given these circumstances, and the fact that traditional methods such as regression are intractable, we have chosen to apply three strategies: (1) using a self-organizing map (SOM) to arrange depth intervals with similar facies into clusters; (2) clustering to split various facies into specific zones; and (3) the cluster analysis technique is used to identify rock type. In the Zamzama gas field, SOM and cluster analysis techniques discovered four group of facies, each of which was internally comparable in petrophysical properties but distinct from the others. Gamma Ray (GR), Effective Porosity(eff), Permeability (Perm) and Water Saturation (Sw) are used to generate these results. The findings and behavior of four facies shows that facies-01 and facies-02 have good characteristics for acting as gas-bearing sediments, whereas facies-03 and facies-04 are non-reservoir sediments. The outcomes of this study stated that facies-01 is an excellent rock-type zone in the reservoir of the Zamzama gas field.",Energies,journal,,1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-20 00:00:00,33,43,"M.

 Accurate long-term inflow forecasts are essential for optimal planning of hydropower production. In snow-rich regions, where spring snowmelt is often the largest reservoir of water, inflow forecasts may be improved by assimilating snow observations to achieve more accurate initial states for the hydrological models prior to the prognosis. In this study, we test whether an ensemble Kalman based approach is useful for this purpose for a mountainous catchment in Norway. For 15 years, annual snow observations near peak accumulation at three locations were assimilated into a distributed hydrological model. After the update, the model was run for a 4-month forecasting period with inflows compared to a base case scenario that omitted the snow observations. The assimilation framework improved the forecasts in several years, and in two of the years, the improvement was very large compared to the base case simulation. At the same time, the filter did not degrade the forecasts largely, indicating that though the updating might slightly degrade performance in some years, it maintains the potential for large improvements in others. Thus, the framework proposed here is a viable method for improving snow-related deficiencies in the initial states, which translates to better forecasts.",Hydrology Research,journal,,e84b6fe8-b23b-4d24-ae72-5f51e785829f,Hydrology Research,,,N/A,2020,2020-03-17 00:00:00,26,38,"J.

It can meet the complementary needs of various energy sources such as cold, thermal, and electricity in industrial parks; can realize multi-energy complements and centralized energy supplies; and can further improve the use efficiency of energy. However, with the extensive access of renewable energy, the uncertainty and intermittentness of renewable energy power generation will greatly reduce the use efficiency of renewable energy and the supply flexibility of IES so as to increase the operational risk of the system operator. With the goal of minimum sum of the system-operating cost and the carbon-emission penalty cost, this paper analyzes the combined supply of cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) influence on system efficiency, compared with the traditional IES. The flexible modified IES realizes the decoupling of cooling, thermal, and electricity; enhances the flexibility of the IES in a variety of energy supply; at the same time, improves the use efficiency of multi-energy; and reasonably avoids the occurrence of energy loss and resource waste. With the aim of reducing the risk that the access of renewable energy may bring to the IES, this paper introduces the fuzzy c-mean-clustering comprehensive quality (FCM-CCQ) algorithm, which is a novel method superior to the general clustering method and performs cluster analysis on the output scenarios of wind power and photovoltaic. Meanwhile, conditional value at risk (CVaR) theory is added to control the system operation risk, which is rarely applied in the field of IES optimization. The model is simulated in a numerical example, and the results demonstrate that the availability and applicability of the presented model are verified. In addition, the carbon dioxide emission of the traditional operation mode; thermoelectric decoupling operation mode; and cooling, thermal, and electricity decoupling operation mode of the IES decrease successively. The system flexibility is greatly enhanced, and the energy-use rate of the system is improved as a whole. Finally, IES, after its flexible transformation, significantly achieve energy conservation, emission reduction, and environmental protection.",Sustainability,journal,,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,N/A,2019,2019-09-28 00:00:00,13,43,"Hang Liu, Shilin Nie","2118959347, 117893116",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a04e436d2c0f7cf063c8805595b1060faa64e5a1,"Economics, Engineering, Environmental Science",2118959347

The primary challenge in this domain is measuring similarity or distance between networks based on topology. However, classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on differences between either node or edge measurements or correlations without considering the topology of networks such as the connected components or holes. In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning based methods have become popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent homology (PH) is a mathematical tool in computational topology that measures the topological features of data that persist across multiple scales with applications ranging from biological networks to social networks. In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of using PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH, review different methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and highlight different algorithms and applications where PH is used in solving network mining problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions. We conclude with directions for future work. We focus our review on recent approaches that get significant attention in the mathematics and data mining communities working on network data. We believe our summary of the analysis of PH on networks will provide important insights to researchers in applied network science.",Applied Network Science,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",053991d8-efbc-4f58-8a74-fe6f1665fb40,Applied Network Science,,4,N/A,2019,2019-07-19 00:00:00,129,81,"M.

Unfortunately, current deep networks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge devices, but also too large for communicating updates over bandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and experimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse Training (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained with substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and in-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that extracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this scheme, ""two birds are killed with one stone:'' instead of full models, each client performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse networks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly accommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse masks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an ""in-time self-ensembling effect'' into the training dynamics, and improves the FL performance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d. FL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our experiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it gains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same upload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2 times the upload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

However, the lifetime of WSNs is extremely restricted due to the delimited energy capacity of their sensor nodes. This is why energy conservation is considered as the most important research concern for WSNs. Radio communication is the utmost energy consuming function in a WSN. Thus, energy efficient routing is necessitated to save energy and thus prolong the lifetime of WSNs. For this reason, numerous protocols for energy efficient routing in WSNs have been proposed. This article offers an analytical and up to date survey on the protocols of this kind. The classic and modern protocols presented are categorized, depending on i) how the network is structured, ii) how data are exchanged, iii) whether location information is or not used, and iv) whether Quality of Service (QoS) or multiple paths are or not supported. In each distinct category, protocols are both described and compared in terms of specific performance metrics, while their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.

Emerging immunotherapeutic approaches have ignited fresh optimism for patient outcomes. This investigation probes the link between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC through Mendelian Randomization and single-cell sequencing, aiming to unearth viable drug targets and dissect HCC's etiology. Methods: We conducted an exhaustive two-sample Mendelian Randomization analysis to ascertain the causal links between immune cell features and HCC, utilizing publicly accessible genetic datasets to explore the causal connections of 731 immune cell traits with HCC susceptibility. The integrity, diversity, and potential horizontal pleiotropy of these findings were rigorously assessed through extensive sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing was employed to penetrate the pathogenic underpinnings of HCC. Results: Establishing a significance threshold of pval_Inverse.variance.weighted at 0.05, our study pinpointed five immune characteristics potentially elevating HCC risk: B cell % CD3- lymphocyte (TBNK panel), CD25 on IgD+ (B cell panel), HVEM on TD CD4+ (Maturation stages of T cell panel), CD14 on CD14+ CD16- monocyte (Monocyte panel), CD4 on CD39+ activated Treg ( Treg panel). Conversely, various cellular phenotypes tied to BAFF-R expression emerged as protective elements. Single-cell sequencing unveiled profound immune cell phenotype interactions, highlighting marked disparities in cell communication and metabolic activities.

Methods: In this study, we integrated multi-omics algorithms to investigate the molecular characteristics of parthanatos in GC.

Results: Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the omics features of parthanatos in various human tumors, including genomic mutations, transcriptome expression, and prognostic relevance. We successfully identified 7 cell types within the GC microenvironment: myeloid cell, epithelial cell, T cell, stromal cell, proliferative cell, B cell, and NK cell. When compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, single-cell sequencing results from GC tissues revealed elevated scores for the parthanatos pathway across multiple cell types. Spatial transcriptomics, for the first time, unveiled the spatial distribution characteristics of parthanatos signaling. GC patients with different parthanatos signals often exhibited distinct immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming features, leading to different clinical outcomes. The integration of parthanatos signaling and clinical indicators enabled the creation of novel survival curves that accurately assess patients’ survival times and statuses.

Initially, single-cell atlas of LDCD signal in KIRC was comprehensively depicted. We also emphasized the molecular characteristics of LDCD-RGs in various human neoplasms. Predicated upon the expressive quotients of LDCD-RGs, we stratified KIRC patients into tripartite cohorts denoted as C1, C2, and C3. Those allocated to the ambit of C1 evinced the most sanguine prognosis within the KIRC cohort, underscored by the acme of LDCD-RGs scores. This further confirms the significant role that LDCD-RGs play in both the pathophysiological foundation and clinical implications of KIRC. In culmination, by virtue of employing the LASSO-Cox analytical modality, we have ushered in an innovative and avant-garde prognostic framework tailored for KIRC, predicated on the bedrock of LDCD-RGs. The assemblage of KIRC instances was arbitrarily apportioned into constituents inclusive of a didactic cohort, an internally wielded validation cadre, and an externally administered validation cohort. Concurrently, patients were dichotomized into strata connoting elevated jeopardy synonymous with adverse prognostic trajectories, and conversely, diminished risk tantamount to favorable prognoses, contingent on the calibrated expressions of LDCD-RGs.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive pan-cancer investigations of MAPK signaling, particularly within the context of KIRC. In this research, we obtained TCGA pan-cancer multi-omics data and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the MAPK signaling pathway. For in-depth investigation in KIRC, status of MAPK pathway was quantitatively estimated by ssGSEA and Ward algorithm was utilized for cluster analysis. Molecular characteristics and clinical prognoses of KIRC patients with distinct MAPK activities were comprehensively explored using a series of bioinformatics algorithms. Subsequently, a combination of LASSO and COX regression analyses were utilized sequentially to construct a MAPK-related signature to help identify the risk level of each sample. Patients in the C1 subtype exhibited relatively higher levels of MAPK signaling activity, which were associated with abundant immune cell infiltration and favorable clinical outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of KIRC samples identified seven distinct cell types, and endothelial cells in tumor tissues had obviously higher MAPK scores than normal tissues.

The aim of this study was to delve into the Purinergic pathway in KIRC and to investigate its potential significance in prognostic assessment and clinical treatment. 33 genes associated with the Purinergic pathway were selected for pan-cancer analysis. Cluster analysis, targeted drug sensitivity analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were applied to explore the mechanism of Purinergic pathway in KIRC. Using the machine learning process, we found that combining the Lasso+survivalSVM algorithm worked well for predicting survival accuracy in KIRC. We used LASSO regression to pinpoint nine Purinergic genes closely linked to KIRC, using them to create a survival model for KIRC. ROC survival curve was analyzed, and this survival model could effectively predict the survival rate of KIRC patients in the next 5, 7 and 10 years. Further univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that age, grading, staging, and risk scores of KIRC patients were significantly associated with their prognostic survival and were identified as independent risk factors for prognosis. The nomogram tool developed through this study can help physicians accurately assess patient prognosis and provide guidance for developing treatment plans. The results of this study may bring new ideas for optimizing the prognostic assessment and therapeutic approaches for KIRC patients.",Aging,,['JournalArticle'],26e723bf-bfa5-4e58-bf99-8abac36e938e,Aging (Albany NY),246 - 266,16,Unknown,2024,2024-01-04 00:00:00,2,91,"Deqian Xie, Shijin Wang, Bowen Jiang, Guandu Li, Guangzhen Wu","2191142464, 2275832288, 2153963897, 2277988298, 2275984968",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fd128b163172e53f3a0b59afdc87a65e1137770a,"Biology, Medicine",2191142464

Since the discovery of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in 1986, many studies have demonstrated abnormal NF-κB signaling is associated with the development of various cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. In this study, the relationship between NF-κB and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma was confirmed using bioinformatics analysis. First, we explored the differential expression of copy number variation (CNV), single nucleotide variant (SNV), and messenger RNA (mRNA) in NF-κB-related genes in different types of cancer, as well as the impact on cancer prognosis and sensitivity to common chemotherapy drugs. Then, we divided the mRNA expression levels of NF-κB-related genes in KIRC patients into three groups through GSVA cluster analysis and explored the correlation between the NF-κB pathway and clinical data of KIRC patients, classical cancer-related genes, common anticancer drug responsiveness, and immune cell infiltration. Finally, 11 tumor-related genes were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct a prognostic model. In addition, we used the UALCAN and HPA databases to verify the protein levels of three key NF-κB-related genes (CHUK, IKGGB, and IKBKG) in KIRC.

Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional study design, typically used in measurement-related studies. A sample of 167 children, ages 5–11 years (mean ± SD: 8.0 ± 1.8 years), performed up to eight seated sedentary activities while wearing accelerometers on both wrists. Activities included: reading books, sorting cards, cutting and pasting, playing board games, eating snacks, playing with tablets, watching TV, and writing. Direct observation verified sedentary behavior from light activity. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to determine optimal cut-point thresholds. Quantile regression models estimated differences between dominant and non-dominant placement. Results: The optimal cut-point threshold for the non-dominant wrist was 203 counts/5 s with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 71.56, 70.83, and 0.72, respectively. A 10-fold cross-validation revealed an average AUC of 0.70. Statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences in median counts ranging from 7 to 46 counts/5 s were found between dominant and non-dominant placement in five out of eight sedentary activities, with the dominant wrist eliciting higher counts/5 s. Conclusion: Results from this study support the recommendation to place accelerometers on the non-dominant wrist to minimize “noise” during seated sedentary behaviors.",Children,journal,['JournalArticle'],083c6c99-5d39-4452-88c4-2963e15f8a0f,Children,,5,N/A,2018,2018-09-26 00:00:00,10,21,"J.

Toddlers’ screen time and personal attributes, physical activity- or screen time-specific parental cognitions and behaviors, and the home and neighborhood environment were measured via parental-report using the PREPS questionnaire. Accelerometry-measured physical activity was available in 123 toddlers. Bayesian estimation in structural equation modeling (SEM) using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was performed to test an SMCB hypothesized model. Covariates included toddlers’ age, sex, race/ethnicity, main type of childcare, and family household income.ResultsIn the SMCB hypothesized screen time model, higher parental barrier self-efficacy for limiting toddlers’ screen time was associated with higher parental screen time limiting practices (β = 0.451), while higher parental negative outcome expectations for limiting toddlers’ screen time was associated with lower parental screen time limiting practices (β = − 0.147). In turn, higher parental screen time limiting practices was associated with lower screen time among toddlers (β = − 0.179). Parental modeling of higher screen time was associated with higher screen time among toddlers directly (β = 0.212) and indirectly through the home environment. Specifically, higher screen time among parents was associated with having at least one electronic device in toddlers’ bedrooms (β = 0.146) and, in turn, having electronics in the bedroom, compared to none, was associated with higher screen time among toddlers (β = 0.250). Neighborhood safety was not associated with toddlers’ screen time in the SEM analysis. No significant correlations were observed between the SMCB variables and toddlers’ physical activity; thus, no further analyses were performed for physical activity.ConclusionsParents and their interactions with the home environment may play an important role in shaping toddlers’ screen time. Findings can inform family-based interventions aiming to minimize toddlers’ screen time.

Accurate assessment of PA is needed to determine trends/correlates of PA, time spent in sedentary, light, or moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA), and the effectiveness of PA promotion programs. Due to the limited availability of objective measures that have been validated and evaluated for feasibility in community studies, it is unclear which subgroups of toddlers are at the highest risk for inactivity. Using Actical ankle accelerometry, the objectives of this study are to develop valid thresholds, examine feasibility, and examine demographic/ anthropometric PA correlates of MVPA among toddlers from low-income families.MethodsTwo studies were conducted with toddlers (12–36 months). Laboratory Study (n = 24)- Two Actical accelerometers were placed on the ankle. PA was observed using the Child Activity Rating Scale (CARS, prescribed activities). Analyses included device equivalence reliability (correlation: activity counts of two Acticals), criterion-related validity (correlation: activity counts and CARS ratings), and sensitivity/specificity for thresholds. Community Study (n = 277, low-income mother-toddler dyads recruited)- An Actical was worn on the ankle for > 7 days (goal >5, 24-h days). Height/weight was measured. Mothers reported demographics. Analyses included frequencies (feasibility) and stepwise multiple linear regression (sMLR).ResultsLaboratory Study- Acticals demonstrated reliability (r = 0.980) and validity (r = 0.75). Thresholds demonstrated sensitivity (86 %) and specificity (88 %). Community Study- 86 % wore accelerometer, 69 % had valid data (mean = 5.2 days). Primary reasons for missing/invalid data: refusal (14 %) and wear-time ≤2 days (11 %). The MVPA threshold (>2200 cpm) yielded 54 min/day. In sMLR, MVPA was associated with age (older > younger, β = 32.8, p < 0.001), gender (boys > girls, β = −11.21, p = 0.032), maternal MVPA (β = 0.44, p = 0.002) and recruitment location (suburban > urban, β = 19.6, p < 0.001), or race (non-Black > Black, β = 18.5, p = 0.001). No association with toddler weight status.ConclusionsAnkle accelerometry is a valid, reliable, and feasible method of assessing PA in community studies of toddlers from low-income families. Sub-populations of toddlers may be at increased risk for inactivity, including toddlers that are younger, female, Black, those with less active mothers, and those living in an urban location.",BMC Public Health,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Study']",c81aae02-04bc-4c4d-811c-5043ae130a31,BMC Public Health,,16,N/A,2016,2016-09-06 00:00:00,45,55,"E.

But most of the state-of-the-art GCN models are shallow structures with depths of no more than 3 to 4 layers, which greatly limits the ability of GCN models to extract high-level features of nodes. There are two main reasons for this: 1) Overlaying too many graph convolution layers will lead to the problem of over-smoothing. 2) Graph convolution is a kind of localized filter, which is easily affected by local properties. To solve the above problems, we first propose a novel general framework for graph neural networks called Non-local Message Passing (NLMP). Under this framework, very deep graph convolutional networks can be flexibly designed, and the over-smoothing phenomenon can be suppressed very effectively. Second, we propose a new spatial graph convolution layer to extract node multiscale high-level node features. Finally, we design an end-to-end Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network II (DGCNNII) model for graph classification task, which is up to 32 layers deep. And the effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by quantifying the graph smoothness of each layer and ablation studies.

With the rapid accumulation of biological network data, GNNs have also become an important tool in bioinformatics. In this research, a systematic survey of GNNs and their advances in bioinformatics is presented from multiple perspectives. We first introduce some commonly used GNN models and their basic principles. Then, three representative tasks are proposed based on the three levels of structural information that can be learned by GNNs: node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. Meanwhile, according to the specific applications for various omics data, we categorize and discuss the related studies in three aspects: disease prediction, drug discovery, and biomedical imaging.

Usually, not all columns show important values. As a result, the machine learning models may perform poorly since the noise or unnecessary columns may confound the algorithms. To address this issue, various feature selection methods have been developed to evaluate large dimensional datasets and identify their subsets of pertinent features. The data, however, frequently skews feature selection algorithms. As a result, ensemble approaches have emerged as a substitute that incorporates the benefits of single feature selection algorithms and makes up for their drawbacks. In order to handle feature selection on datasets with large dimensionality, this research aims to grasp the key ideas and links in the process of aggregating feature selection methods. The suggested idea is tested by creating a cross-validation implementation that combines a number of Python packages with functionality to enable the feature selection techniques. By identifying pertinent features in the human, chimpanzee, and dog DNA datasets, the performance of the implementation was demonstrated.",3C Tecnología_Glosas de innovación aplicadas a la pyme,Unknown,,Unknown,3C Tecnología_Glosas de innovación aplicadas a la pyme,,,Unknown,2022,2022-12-29 00:00:00,5,15,"B.

While the machine learning community has generally accepted methods such as k-fold stratified cross-validation (CV) to be more rigorous than single split validation, the standard research practice in medical fields is the use of single split validation techniques. This is especially concerning given the relatively small sample sizes of datasets used for cardiovascular imaging. We aim to examine how train-test split variation impacts the stability of machine learning (ML) model performance estimates in several validation techniques on two real-world cardiovascular imaging datasets: stratified split-sample validation (70/30 and 50/50 train-test splits), tenfold stratified CV, 10 × repeated tenfold stratified CV, bootstrapping (500 × repeated), and leave one out (LOO) validation. We demonstrate that split validation methods lead to the highest range in AUC and statistically significant differences in ROC curves, unlike the other aforementioned approaches. When building predictive models on relatively small data sets as is often the case in medical imaging, split-sample validation techniques can produce instability in performance estimates with variations in range over 0.15 in the AUC values, and thus any of the alternate validation methods are recommended.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,N/A,2021,2021-07-14 00:00:00,44,18,"Vikash R Singh, M.

However, the size of the datasets and the train/test split ratios can greatly affect the outcome of the models, and thus the classification performance itself. We compared several combinations of dataset sizes and split ratios with five different machine learning algorithms to find the differences or similarities and to select the best parameter settings in nonbinary (multiclass) classification. It is also known that the models are ranked differently according to the performance merit(s) used. Here, 25 performance parameters were calculated for each model, then factorial ANOVA was applied to compare the results. The results clearly show the differences not just between the applied machine learning algorithms but also between the dataset sizes and to a lesser extent the train/test split ratios. The XGBoost algorithm could outperform the others, even in multiclass modeling. The performance parameters reacted differently to the change of the sample set size; some of them were much more sensitive to this factor than the others. Moreover, significant differences could be detected between train/test split ratios as well, exerting a great effect on the test validation of our models.",Molecules,journal,['JournalArticle'],91b19bbf-b6f0-46c2-bbec-6bcfb5463d4d,Molecules,,26,N/A,2021,2021-02-01 00:00:00,187,43,"Anita Rácz, D.

With these data, defect prediction software can try to estimate the defect proneness of a software module, with the objective of assisting and guiding software practitioners. With timely and accurate defect predictions, practitioners can focus their limited testing resources on higher risk areas. This paper reports the results of three empirical studies that uses an automated genetic defect prediction framework. This framework generates and compares different learning schemes (preprocessing + attribute selection + learning algorithms) and selects the best one using a genetic algorithm, with the objective to estimate the defect proneness of a software module. The first empirical study is a performance comparison of our framework with the most important framework of the literature. The second empirical study is a performance and runtime comparison between our framework and an exhaustive framework. The third empirical study is a sensitivity analysis. The last empirical study, is our main contribution in this paper. Performance of the software development defect prediction models (using AUC, Area Under the Curve) was validated using NASA-MDP and PROMISE data sets. Seventeen data sets from NASA-MDP (13) and PROMISE (4) projects were analyzed running a NxM-fold cross-validation. A genetic algorithm was used to select the components of the learning schemes automatically, and to assess and report the results. Our results reported similar performance between frameworks. Our framework reported better runtime than exhaustive framework.

Despite its potential to transform current pedagogies and learning experiences through engaging, interactive, and fascinating educational techniques, research is limited in exploring its application, usability, and user experience, particularly for Thai undergraduate students in learning computer engineering courses. In response, we designed and developed an innovative metaverse-based learning system called the AIIS collaborative learning interface, tailored to European undergraduate students. While the original intent of AIIS was to cater to medical students, in this study, our objective was to assess its usability and applicability for computer science and engineering students, specifically focusing on the Asian demographic. After an initial pilot with European students in their local context, the research was extended to Thailand, where 21 Thai undergraduate students evaluated the platform’s usability. The observations from this study indicate that AIIS provides a dynamic, user-friendly learning environment. Nevertheless, the evaluation process unveiled some usability flaws that offer informative directions for future enhancements. Drawing from our observations, we formulated usability guidelines to guide designers and developers toward crafting more efficient metaverse systems, particularly those intended for educational use.

This research study of a basic/substantive non-experimental type and correlational level has been developed under a quantitative approach with a cross section. The sample consisted of 328 students of both genders, selected from a public university in the city of Lima. Two standardized tools were adapted for data collection. Two questionnaires were also applied: time management and academic stress. The results showed that there was an inverse correlation between time management and academic stress (Spearman's Rho = .413), as well as for the dimensions of academic stress: stressors (- .405), symptoms (-, 387) and coping (, 286).

Developing reconfigurable fiber-based memristors is an efficient method to realize electronic textiles that capable of neuromorphic computing function. However, the previously reported artificial synapse and neuron need different materials and configurations, making it difficult to realize multiple functions in a single device. Herein, a textile memristor network of Ag/MoS2/HfAlOx/carbon nanotube with reconfigurable characteristics was reported, which can achieve both nonvolatile synaptic plasticity and volatile neuron functions. In addition, a single reconfigurable memristor can realize integrate-and-fire function, exhibiting significant advantages in reducing the complexity of neuron circuits. The firing energy consumption of fiber-based memristive neuron is 1.9 fJ/spike (femtojoule-level), which is at least three orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported biological and artificial neuron (picojoule-level). The ultralow energy consumption makes it possible to create an electronic neural network that reduces the energy consumption compared to human brain. By integrating the reconfigurable synapse, neuron and heating resistor, a smart textile system is successfully constructed for warm fabric application, providing a unique functional reconfiguration pathway toward the next-generation in-memory computing textile system. Neuromorphic computing memristors are attractive to construct low-power- consumption electronic textiles.

However, such interstitial doping inevitably leads to lattice microstrain that impairs the long-range ordering and stability of the crystals, causing a sacrificial trade-off. Here, we unravel the evident influence of the valence states of the interstitial cations on their efficacy to suppress the ion migration. Incorporation of a trivalent neodymium cation (Nd3+) effectively mitigates the ion migration in the perovskite lattice with a reduced dosage (0.08%) compared to a widely used monovalent cation dopant (Na+, 0.45%). The photovoltaic performances and operational stability of the prototypical perovskite solar cells are enhanced with a trace amount of Nd3+ doping while minimizing the sacrificial trade-off. Ion migration has a detrimental effect on the performance and stability of halide perovskite optoelectronics. Here, the authors incorporated a small dosage of high-valence neodymium cation to suppress this, with a minimal impact on the lattice microstrain.",Nature Materials,journal,['JournalArticle'],2cc29e11-7fb1-434f-bc7c-efbf9e64672a,Nature Materials,1396 - 1402,21,N/A,2022,2022-11-17 00:00:00,127,41,"Yepin Zhao, I.

This paper proposes a biomimetic ocular prosthesis system that mimics the human light modulation response capable of pupil and corneal reflections. First, photoinduced synaptic properties of the quantum dot embedded photonic synapse and its biosimilar signal transmission is confirmed. Subsequently, the pupillary light reflex is emulated by incorporating the quantum dot embedded photonic synapse, electrochromic device, and CMOS components. Moreover, a solenoid-based eyelid is connected to the pupillary light reflex system to emulate the corneal reflex. The proposed ocular prosthesis system represents a platform for biomimetic prosthesis that can accommodate an appropriate amount of stimulus by self-regulating the intensity of external stimuli. The adoption of photonic synapses with biosimilarity to realize analog signal transmission is of significance in realizing artificial illuminance modulation responses.

To date, several artificial haptic-based sensing techniques can accurately measure physical stimuli. However, quantifying the psychological parameters of tactile perception to achieve texture and roughness identification remains challenging. Here, we developed a smart finger with surpassed human tactile perception, which enabled accurate identification of material type and roughness through the integration of triboelectric sensing and machine learning. In principle, as each material has different capabilities to gain or lose electrons, a unique triboelectric fingerprint output will be generated when the triboelectric sensor is in contact with the measured object. The construction of a triboelectric sensor array could further eliminate interference from the environment, and the accuracy rate of material identification was as high as 96.8%.

In general, vast amounts of data are collected from various sensors in an IIoT environment, and they are analyzed to prevent failures by predicting their occurrence. However, the collected data may include data irrelevant to failures and thereby decrease the prediction accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a failure prediction model using iterative feature selection. To build the model, the relevancy between each feature (i.e., each sensor) and the failure was analyzed using the random forest algorithm, to obtain the importance of the features. Then, feature selection and model building were conducted iteratively. In each iteration, a new feature was selected considering the importance and added to the selected feature set. The failure prediction model was built for each iteration via the support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the failure prediction model having the highest prediction accuracy was selected. The experimental implementation was conducted using open-source R. The results showed that the proposed failure prediction model achieved high prediction accuracy.",Symmetry,journal,['JournalArticle'],1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,454,12,N/A,2020,2020-03-12 00:00:00,10,36,"Jung-Hyok Kwon, Eui-Jik Kim","2409351, 121855842",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8a6b4f30728cb9d92f589644988396f54e7cc12,"Computer Science, Engineering",2409351

These feature engineering techniques can further be optimized using optimization algorithms. This paper proposes a similar framework by implementing one such optimization algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), incorporating different feature selection and feature extraction techniques on textual and numerical datasets using four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest (RF). The aim is to show the difference in the results achieved on both datasets with the help of comparative analysis. The proposed feature selection and feature extraction techniques assist in enhancing the performance of the machine learning model. This research article considers numerical and text-based datasets for stroke prediction and detecting hate speech, respectively. The text dataset is prepared by extracting tweets consisting of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments from Twitter API. A maximum improvement in accuracy of 10.07% is observed for Random Forest with the TF-IDF feature extraction technique on the application of ACO. Besides, this study also highlights the limitations of text data that inhibit the performance of machine learning models, justifying the difference of almost 18.43% in accuracy compared to that of numerical data.",Big Data and Cognitive Computing,,['JournalArticle'],e7c556b0-162f-4c48-9d25-fe3c141f984e,Big Data Cogn.

It has an effective impact on the global economy specifically, on the financial movement of stock markets. Recently, an accurate stock market prediction has been of great interest to investors. A sudden change in the stock movement due to COVID -19 appearance causes some problems for investors. From this point, we propose an efficient system that applies sentiment analysis of COVID-19 news and articles to extract the final impact of COVID-19 on the financial stock market. In this paper, we propose a stock market prediction system that extracts the stock movement with the COVID spread. It is important to predict the effect of these diseases on the economy to be ready for any disease change and protect our economy. In this paper, we apply sentimental analysis to stock news headlines to predict the daily future trend of stock in the COVID-19 period. Also, we use machine learning classifiers to predict the final impact of COVID-19 on some stocks such as TSLA, AMZ, and GOOG stock. For improving the performance and quality of future trend predictions, feature selection and spam tweet reduction are performed on the data sets. Finally, our proposed system is a hybrid system that applies text mining on social media data mining on the historical stock dataset to improve the whole prediction performance. The proposed system predicts stock movement for TSLA, AMZ, and GOOG with average prediction accuracy of 90%, 91.6%, and 92.3% respectively.",Multimedia tools and applications,journal,"['News', 'JournalArticle']",477368e9-7a8e-475a-8c93-6d623797fd06,Multimedia Tools and Applications,1 - 33,,N/A,2022,2022-11-28 00:00:00,23,36,"M.

Even the commonly used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and long short-term memory (LSTM) have their own advantages and disadvantages. We use mean squared error (MSE) to judge the most suitable model for predicting Amazon’s stock price from many aspects and find that LSTM is the model with the best fitting effect and the closest to the real curve. However, the LSTM model still needs to improve in terms of performance so as to reduce the bias.

These indicators are based on three broad categories of technical analysis: Price, Volume, and Turnover. Various error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) have been used to check the performance of the models. Results show that the XGBoost algorithm performs best among the four ensemble models. The mean of absolute error and the root-mean-square -error vary around 3–5%. The feature importance plots generated by the models depict the importance of the variables in predicting the output. The proposed machine learning models help traders, investors, as well as portfolio managers, better predict the stock market trends and, in turn, the returns, particularly in banking stocks minimizing their sole dependency on macroeconomic factors. The techniques further assist the market participants in pre-empting any price-volume action across stocks irrespective of their size, liquidity, or past turnover. Finally, the techniques are incredibly robust and display a strong capability in predicting trend forecasts, particularly with any large deviations.",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,journal,,5bccd387-3836-42f2-9b60-9c190333ae01,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,,N/A,2022,2022-08-07 00:00:00,15,66,"S.

In modern financial markets, traders and practitioners have had trouble predicting the stock market price index. In order to solve this problem, some methods have been researched by researchers and suitable methods have been found. To analyze and forecast monthly stock market price index, a variety of statistical and econometric models are extensively used. Thus, this study aims to investigate the application of autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) for forecasting monthly stock market price index in Istanbul for the period from 2009-M01 to 2021-M03. As compared to all other tentative models, the research showed that the ARIMA (3,1,5) model is the best fit model for predicting the stock market price index. Forecasting is conducted by using the developed model ARIMA (3,1,5) and the results indicated that the forecasted values are very similar to the actual ones, reducing forecast errors. In general, the stock market price index in Istanbul; showed a downwards trend over the forecasted period.

The coordination of gait movement is directly affected by the cooperation and functional connectivity between muscles. However, the mechanisms of muscle operation at different gait speeds remain unclear. Therefore, this study addressed the gait speed effect on the changes in cooperative modules and functional connectivity between muscles. To this end, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals were collected from eight key lower extremity muscles of twelve healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at high, middle, and low motion speeds. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) was applied to the sEMG envelope and intermuscular coherence matrix, yielding five muscle synergies. Muscle functional networks were constructed by decomposing the intermuscular coherence matrix, revealing different layers of functional muscle networks across frequencies. In addition, the coupling strength between cooperative muscles grew with gait speed. Different coordination patterns among muscles with changes in gait speed related to the neuromuscular system regulation were identified.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering,journal,['JournalArticle'],416b088d-de72-4dbf-959e-8551984d9676,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,1230-1237,31,N/A,2023,2023-02-06 00:00:00,7,46,"Tie Liang, Huacong Miao, Hongrui Wang, Xiaoguang Liu, Xiuling Liu","2112369139, 2204823453, 2109234009, 2109010804, 2109305689",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf75253c6ec3360d80c0ccd9ea7202af2d63710d,"Engineering, Medicine",2112369139

The general aim of scene text understanding is to localize and recognize text in scene images. Text regions are first localized in the original image by a trained detector model and afterwards fed into a recognition module. The tasks of localization and recognition are highly correlated since an inaccurate localization can affect the recognition task. The main purpose of this thesis is to devise efficient methods for scene text understanding. We investigate how the latest results on deep learning can advance text understanding pipelines. Recently, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and derived methods have achieved a significant performance on semantic segmentation and pixel level classification tasks. Therefore, we took benefit of the strengths of FCN approaches in order to detect and recognize text in natural scenes images.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Electronic Letters on Computer Vision and Image Analysis,6-10,18,Unknown,2020,2020-02-07 00:00:00,1,9,Dena Bazazian,2644209,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1b49c740123e2e0a3b00afe10e856d9d54d71aa,Computer Science,2644209

However, the post-processing of binarization is essential for segmentation-based detection, which converts probability maps produced by a segmentation method into bounding boxes/regions of text. In this paper, we propose a module named Differentiable Binarization (DB), which can perform the binarization process in a segmentation network. Optimized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can adaptively set the thresholds for binarization, which not only simplifies the post-processing but also enhances the performance of text detection. Based on a simple segmentation network, we validate the performance improvements of DB on five benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and speed. In particular, with a light-weight backbone, the performance improvements by DB are significant so that we can look for an ideal tradeoff between detection accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, with a backbone of ResNet-18, our detector achieves an F-measure of 82.8, running at 62 FPS, on the MSRA-TD500 dataset.

The VANET, based on 5G (5G-VANET), provides advanced facilities to the driving of vehicles such as reliable communication, less end-to-end latency, a higher data rate transmission, reasonable cost, and assured quality of experience (QoE) for delivered services. However, the crucial challenge with these recent technologies is to design a real-time multimedia traffic shaping that maintains smooth connectivity under the unpredictable change of channel capacity and data rate due to handover for rapid vehicle mobility among roadside units. This research proposes a smart real-time multimedia traffic shaping to control the amount and the rate of the traffic sent to the 5G-VANET based on distributed reinforcement learning (RMDRL). The proposed mechanism selects the accurate decisions of coding parameters such as quantization parameters, group of pictures, and frame rate that are used to manipulate the required traffic shaping of the multimedia stream on the 5G-VANET. Furthermore, the impact of the aforementioned three coding parameters has been comprehensively studied using five video clips to achieve the optimal traffic rate value for real-time multimedia streaming on 5G communication. The proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline traffic shaping in terms of peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and end-to-end frame delay. This research will open new comfortable facilities for vehicle manufacturing to enhance the data communication system on the 5G-VANET.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-01-30 00:00:00,21,34,"A.

This cross-sectional analysis explored the association between geriatric obesity and education level, along with other demographic characteristics in Taipei, Taiwan between 2013 and 2015. Taipei citizens ≥ 65 years (aborigines ≥ 55 years) were recruited to participate in the elderly health examination programme. Logistic regression was applied to analyse the relationship between obesity (defined as body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m2 in Taiwan) and education level among men and women after controlling for age, race, income status, and smoking status. A total of 28,092 men and 31,835 women were included in the final analysis. Compared to those with education years ≥ 16, older men and women with education years ≤ 12 had higher odds of being obese. The odds ratios increase as years of education decrease, and the trend is more pronounced among women. Aborigines had much higher chances of being obese among men and women, while there were no differences by income status. The results clarified the factors related to obesity in the elderly, and will be useful for authorities working to improve health outcomes among this population.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,N/A,2020,2020-11-20 00:00:00,42,45,"Tsai-Hao Hsieh, J.

In this exploratory research, we investigated the concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors including smoking, body mass index, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake, and alcohol use within African American heterosexual couples. We also examined whether females’ stress is associated with their own (actor effect) and males’ cancer-related lifestyle factors (partner effect), and vice versa. We analyzed a total of 216 heterosexual couples (i.e., N = 432 individuals) recruited from black churches. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated and multilevel modeling in which individuals are nested within couples was conducted. Results showed that there was high concordance of body mass index (ICC = 1.68, p < .001), fruit and vegetable intake (ICC = 1.62, p < .001), red meat intake (ICC = 1.50, p = .001), and alcohol use (ICC = 1.74, p < .001) between spouses. A multilevel analysis showed that there were actor and partner effects of stress on females’ BMI; females’ stress was positively associated with their own BMI (actor effect; β = .42, p = .006) and males’ stress was positively associated with females’ BMI (partner effect; β = .39, p = .026). Also, females’ stress was positively associated with their own red meat intake (actor effect; β = .20, p = .019). In conclusion, high concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors (BMI, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake and alcohol use) exists between African American spouses. Given the identified actor and partner effects of stress on females’ BMI, a couple-based lifestyle or weight management intervention that targets both male and female spouses’ stress and coping will be promising, particularly to enhance African American women’s health behaviors. Future studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying concordance and discordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors in African American couples. Also, factors that explain African American male spouses’ health behaviors need to be uncovered.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,15,N/A,2020,2020-05-08 00:00:00,3,54,"Dalnim Cho, K.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with the upregulation of serum LEP. LEP promoter methylation is associated with obesity. So far, few studies have explored the association of BMI and OA with LEP methylation. We assessed the interaction between body mass index (BMI) and OA on LEP promoter methylation. Data of 1114 participants comprising 583 men and 558 women, aged 30–70 years were retrieved from the Taiwan Biobank Database (2008–2015). Osteoarthritis was self-reported and cases were those who reported having ever been clinically diagnosed with osteoarthritis. BMI was categorized into underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. The mean LEP promoter methylation level in individuals with osteoarthritis was 0.5509 ± 0.00437 and 0.5375 ± 0.00101 in those without osteoarthritis. The interaction between osteoarthritis and BMI on LEP promoter methylation was significant (p-value = 0.0180). With normal BMI as the reference, the mean LEP promoter methylation level was significantly higher in obese osteoarthritic individuals (β = 0.03696, p-value = 0.0187). However, there was no significant association between BMI and LEP promoter methylation in individuals without osteoarthritis, regardless of BMI. In conclusion, only obesity was significantly associated with LEP promoter methylation (higher levels) specifically in osteoarthritic patients.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,21,N/A,2019,2019-12-23 00:00:00,9,45,"Tzi-Peng Yang, Hsiao-Mei Chen, Chao-Chin Hu, Li-Yuan Chen, F.

An International Retrospective Cohort Study,"Abstract BACKGROUND Despite our inability to accurately predict survival in many cancer patients, a life expectancy of at least 3 mo is historically necessary to be considered for surgical treatment of spinal metastases. OBJECTIVE To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients surviving <3 mo after surgical treatment to patients surviving >3 mo to assess the validity of this inclusion criteria. METHODS Patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastases between August 2013 and May 2017 were retrospectively identified from an international cohort study. HRQOL was evaluated using generic and disease-specific outcome tools at baseline and at 6 and 12 wk postsurgery. The primary outcome was the HRQOL at 6 wk post-treatment measured by the Spine Oncology Study Group Outcomes Questionnaire (SOSGOQ). RESULTS A total of 253 patients were included: 40 patients died within the first 3 mo after surgery and 213 patients survived more than 3 mo. Patients surviving <3 mo after surgery presented with lower baseline performance status. Adjusted analyses for baseline performance status did not reveal a significant difference in HRQOL between both groups at 6 wk post-treatment. No significant difference in patient satisfaction at 6 wk with regard to their treatment could be detected between both groups. CONCLUSION When controlled for baseline performance status, quality of life 6 wk after surgery for spinal metastasis is independent of survival. To optimize improvement in HRQOL for this patient population, baseline performance status should take priority over expected survival in the surgical decision-making process.",Neurosurgery,journal,['JournalArticle'],396750b3-c753-4765-b283-ca20a4ddd616,Neurosurgery,303 - 311,87,N/A,2019,2019-11-06 00:00:00,55,27,"N.

The lower productivity exhibited by these SMEs in Sri Lanka was identified as a result of the high participation rate of female entrepreneurs in the informal economy. An unfavourable environment has been created obstructing the transition of women entrepreneurs towards the upper echelon of the business world through diverse impediments. Thus, the research focused on exploring the barriers that hinder the business growth of women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises. Accordingly, the research was conducted as secondary research: a literature survey. In Sri Lanka, a minor percentage of female participation in small and medium enterprises occurs due to limited access to financial resources, lack of financial literacy, social prejudices, social and cultural restrictions, and limited opportunities for networking and communicating with external resources. Thus, closing the gender gap in education, giving access to capital through a concerted policy action and providing women entrepreneurs with opportunities to improve their financial literacy and educational level were highlighted as the major recommendations in the study to empower women entrepreneurs to climb the value chain. Women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises need to be facilitated with greater access to the domestic, regional and international markets in order to enable them to expand their businesses with productivity and innovation. Thus, vital policy measures should be taken to mitigate the barriers involved in formalizing the business mechanisms while focusing on increasing the benefits that women entrepreneurs can gain through that standardizing process.",Kelaniya Journal of Management,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",ec75610f-5ca7-442a-a9be-eaa05bffd2b7,Kelaniya Journal of Management,,,N/A,2024,2024-04-30 00:00:00,2,5,"D.

 In addition to the influence of climate change on water availability and hydrological risks, the effects on water quality are in the early stages of investigations. This study aims to consolidate the latest interdisciplinary research in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of assessment of water quality parameters and its prediction. This research paper specifically explores the intricate relationship between climate change and water quality parameters at Sandia station, situated within the Narmada basin in Central India. As global climatic patterns continue to shift, the repercussions on water resources have gained prominence. In this work, electrical conductivity is predicted using the KERAS data processing environment on TensorFlow. The root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), etc. are calculated between observed and predicted values to assess the model performance. A total of 10 models are developed depending upon the input geometry from past monthly timelines. The results indicate that Model no. 8, with 10 inputs performs the best based on the R2 value of 0.889. These results indicate that AI can be very helpful in analyzing the possible threats in the future for drinking, water, livestock feeding, irrigation, and so on.",Journal of Water and Climate Change,journal,['JournalArticle'],3ab6c231-a535-47cb-9af7-b55c4fe50642,Journal of Water and Climate Change,,,N/A,2024,2024-02-19 00:00:00,4,0,"Deepak Kumar Tiwari, K.

In addition to the precipitation and other meteorological time series, catchment characteristics, including soil data, land use, land cover, and roughness, are essential in most hydrologic models. The unavailability of these data series challenged the accuracy of simulations. However, recent advances in soft computing techniques offer better approaches and solutions at less computational complexity. These require a minimum amount of data, while they reach higher accuracies depending on the quality of data sets. The Gradient Boosting Algorithms and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are two such systems that can be used in simulating river flows based on the catchment rainfall. In this paper, the computational capabilities of these two systems were tested in simulated river flows by developing the prediction models for Malwathu Oya in Sri Lanka. The simulated flows were then compared with the ground-measured river flows for accuracy. Correlation of coefficient (R), Per cent-Bias (bias), Nash Sutcliffe Model efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root mean square error (RMSE) were used as the comparative indices between Gradient Boosting Algorithms and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference Systems. Results of the study showcased that both systems can simulate river flows as a function of catchment rainfalls; however, the Cat gradient Boosting algorithm (CatBoost) has a computational edge over the Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The CatBoost algorithm outperformed other algorithms used in this study, with the best correlation score for the testing dataset having 0.9934. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Light gradient boosting (LightGBM), and Ensemble models scored 0.9283, 0.9253, and 0.9109, respectively. However, more applications should be investigated for sound conclusions.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLOS ONE,,18,N/A,2023,2023-04-26 00:00:00,13,56,"Namal Rathnayake, Upaka S.

Parental distress caused by economic pressure may increase violence against children. High levels of gender inequality and interpersonal violence may contribute to higher levels of physical abuse. Using an ecological perspective, this study examines the association of country-level gender inequality and household-level parental physical abuse, and the moderating role of child gender in this association in low- and middle-income countries. We used data on over 420,000 households from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and country-level indicators from the United Nations Development Program Human Development data. We employed multilevel logistic regression to examine the association between gender inequality with the log-odds of physical abuse after accounting for country- and individual-level covariates. In order to more fully explore our results, we calculated predicted probabilities of abuse for several scenarios. The results indicated that higher levels of gender inequality were associated with higher probabilities of physical abuse. This association was stronger for female children than for male children. The probabilities of abuse by child gender were indistinguishable, although rates of physical abuse converged as gender inequality increased, at a statistically marginal level. These findings indicate that macro-level interventions that reduce gender inequality are necessary to prevent and reduce child physical abuse.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,19,N/A,2022,2022-09-21 00:00:00,19,62,"Julie Ma, Andrew C.

Authors of this paper while searching for possible solutions for medical context learning found that unified corpora tagged with medical nomenclature was missing to train the analytics for medical context learning. Therefore, here we demonstrated a mechanism to come up with uniform NER (Named Entity Recognition) tagged medical corpora that is fed with 14407 endocrine patients’ dataset in CSV format diagnosed with DM and comorbidity diseases. The other corpus is of ICD-10-CM coding scheme in text format taken from www.icd10data.com.

It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4–5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more. We used this library to successfully create a complete deep learning course, which we were able to write more quickly than using previous approaches, and the code was more clear.

To be useful in clinical practice, it is necessary to have well calibrated measures of the uncertainty with which these systems report their decisions. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are being often overconfident in their predictions, and are not amenable to a straightforward probabilistic treatment. Here, we describe an intuitive framework based on test-time data augmentation for quantifying the diagnostic uncertainty of a state-of-the-art DNN for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. We show that the derived measure of uncertainty is well-calibrated and that experienced physicians likewise find cases with uncertain diagnosis difficult to evaluate. This paves the way for an integrated treatment of uncertainty in DNN-based diagnostic systems.",Medical Image Anal.,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Medical image analysis,"

Efficiently programming these systems has become a major challenge due to the complexity of their architectures and the efforts required to provide them with co-execution capabilities that can fully exploit the applications. There are many proposals to simplify the programming and management of acceleration devices and multi-core CPUs. However, in many cases, portability and ease of use compromise the efficiency of different devices—even more so when co-executing. Intel oneAPI, a new and powerful standards-based unified programming model, built on top of SYCL, addresses these issues. In this paper, oneAPI is provided with co-execution strategies to run the same kernel between different devices, enabling the exploitation of static and dynamic policies. This work evaluates the performance and energy efficiency for a well-known set of regular and irregular HPC benchmarks, using two heterogeneous systems composed of an integrated GPU and CPU. Static and dynamic load balancers are integrated and evaluated, highlighting single and co-execution strategies and the most significant key points of this promising technology. Experimental results show that co-execution is worthwhile when using dynamic algorithms and improves the efficiency even further when using unified shared memory.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2021,2021-09-29 00:00:00,10,37,"Raúl Nozal, J.

However, optimal IRT calibration methods have not been established and the clinical performance of these devices relative to the more common non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) remains unclear. In addition to confirming the findings of our preliminary analysis of clinical study results, the primary intent of this study was to compare methods for IRT calibration and identify best practices for assessing the performance of IRTs intended to detect EBT. A key secondary aim was to compare IRT clinical accuracy to that of NCITs. We performed a clinical thermographic imaging study of more than 1000 subjects, acquiring temperature data from several facial locations that, along with reference oral temperatures, were used to calibrate two IRT systems based on seven different regression methods. Oral temperatures imputed from facial data were used to evaluate IRT clinical accuracy based on metrics such as clinical bias (Δcb), repeatability, root-mean-square difference, and sensitivity/specificity. We proposed several calibration approaches designed to account for the non-uniform data density across the temperature range and a constant offset approach tended to show better ability to detect EBT. As in our prior study, inner canthi or full-face maximum temperatures provided the highest clinical accuracy. With an optimal calibration approach, these methods achieved a Δcb between ±0.03 °C with standard deviation (σΔcb) less than 0.3 °C, and sensitivity/specificity between 84% and 94%. Results of forehead-center measurements with NCITs or IRTs indicated reduced performance. An analysis of the complete clinical data set confirms the essential findings of our preliminary evaluation, with minor differences. Our findings provide novel insights into methods and metrics for the clinical accuracy assessment of IRTs. Furthermore, our results indicate that calibration approaches providing the highest clinical accuracy in the 37–38.5 °C range may be most effective for measuring EBT.

This study aimed to develop and determine the accuracy of detecting different ADLs using machine-learning (ML) algorithms and wearable sensors. Eleven post-stroke patients participated in this pilot study at an ADL Simulation Lab across two study visits. We collected blocks of repeated activity (“atomic” activity) performance data to train our ML algorithms during one visit. We evaluated our ML algorithms using independent semi-naturalistic activity data collected at a separate session. We tested Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for model development. XGBoost was the best classification model. We achieved 82% accuracy based on ten ADL tasks. With a model including seven tasks, accuracy improved to 90%. ADL tasks included chopping food, vacuuming, sweeping, spreading jam or butter, folding laundry, eating, brushing teeth, taking off/putting on a shirt, wiping a cupboard, and buttoning a shirt. Results provide preliminary evidence that ADL functioning can be predicted with adequate accuracy using wearable sensors and ML. The use of external validation (independent training and testing data sets) and semi-naturalistic testing data is a major strength of the study and a step closer to the long-term goal of ADL monitoring in real-world settings. Further investigation is needed to improve the ADL prediction accuracy, increase the number of tasks monitored, and test the model outside of a laboratory setting.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,18,N/A,2021,2021-02-01 00:00:00,29,38,"Pin-Wei Chen, Nathan A.

Reablement is one form of rehabilitative intervention, which aims to restore ADL functions performed in the community. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of home-based reablement from 3 concepts of ADL (ie, actual performance, ability, and self-perceived difficulty) for patients with stroke. Methods: This was a single-blind pilot randomized clinical trial. Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups: home-based reablement group (n = 12) and control group (n = 14). The home-based reablement group received ADL training in the home environment for 6 weeks. The control group received conventional rehabilitation in the hospital. Outcome measures contained the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales (BI-SS). The COPM was applied to identify patients’ level of performance and satisfaction with ADL training. The BI-SS included 3 ADL scales: actual performance, ability, and self-perceived difficulty. Results: The patients in the home-based reablement group showed statistically significant improvements in the ability scale and total score of the BI-SS than the control group (P < .05) and demonstrated moderate effect size (success rate difference = 0.34–0.42). No significant differences were noticed in the COPM and the other 2 scales of the BI-SS (actual performance and self-perceived difficulty), but small effect sizes were found (success rate difference = 0.17–0.22). Conclusions: For patients with stroke, the 6-week home-based reablement program had similar effects with the control group on patients’ perceived performance, satisfaction, and difficulty in ADL, but it displayed potential for enhancing their ability in executing ADL tasks.",Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],2ae18de8-1e0b-4f92-9aa3-866ffc4f36e7,Medicine,,99,N/A,2020,2020-12-04 00:00:00,9,26,"Der-Sheng Han, Po-Wen Chuang, E.

This present study aimed to investigate the association between stress hyperglycemia and SAP. Methods Patients were screened between February 2013 and August 2020 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. We divided the blood glucose of the patients at admission by the glycated hemoglobin to calculate the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between SAP and SHR, with the confounders being controlled. Further, subgroup analyses were separately performed for stroke patients with and without diabetes. Results A total of 2,039 patients were finally recruited, of which 533 (26.14%) were diagnosed with SAP. SHR were divided into four quartiles in the logistic regression analysis, the highest SHR quartile (SHR ≥ 1.15) indicated a higher risk of SAP (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.13–2.19, p = 0.01) in total patients. In patients without diabetes, the third quantile (SHR = 0.96–1.14) and the highest quantile (SHR ≥ 1.15) were both related to a higher risk of SAP (both p < 0.05). However, we did not find such an association in diabetic patients. Conclusion SHR was significantly associated with the risk of SAP in patients without diabetes.

Methods We included 205 patients with HCI from November 2018 to December 2019. The diagnostic criterion for SAP was occurrence within 7 days of the onset of stroke. Poor outcome was defined as a functional outcome based on a 3-months MRS score >3. The relationship of demographic, laboratory and neuroimaging variables with SAP and poor outcome was investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Fifty seven (27.8%) patients were diagnosed with SAP and 40 (19.5%) developed poor outcomes. A2DS2 score (OR = 1.284; 95% CI: 1.048–1.574; P = 0.016), previous stroke (OR = 2.630; 95% CI: 1.122–6.163; P = 0.026), consciousness (OR = 2.945; 95% CI: 1.514–5.729; P < 0.001), brain atrophy (OR = 1.427; 95% CI: 1.040–1.959; P = 0.028), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.715; 95% CI: 1.163–2.528; P = 0.006) were independently associated with the occurrence of SAP. Therefore, we combined these variables into a new SAP prediction model with the C-statistic of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78–0.90). Fasting plasma glucose (OR = 1.404; 95% CI: 1.202–1.640; P < 0.001), NIHSS score (OR = 1.088; 95% CI: 1.010–1.172; P = 0.026), previous stroke (OR = 4.333; 95% CI: 1.645–11.418; P = 0.003), SAP (OR = 3.420; 95% CI: 1.332–8.787; P = 0.011), basal ganglia-dilated perivascular spaces (BG-dPVS) (OR = 2.124; 95% CI: 1.313–3.436; P = 0.002), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.680; 95% CI: 1.166–2.420; P = 0.005) were independently associated with poor outcome. The C-statistic of the outcome model was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81–0.94). Furthermore, the SAP model significantly improved discrimination and net benefit more than the A2DS2 scale, with a C-statistic of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.83). Conclusions After the addition of neuroimaging features, the models exhibit good differentiation and calibration for the prediction of the occurrence of SAP and the development of poor outcomes in HCI patients. The SAP model could better predict the SAP, representing a helpful and valid tool to obtain a net benefit compared with the A2DS2 scale.",Frontiers in Neurology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3513ce18-3757-4358-b15f-7060af98e6d0,Frontiers in Neurology,,13,N/A,2022,2022-02-04 00:00:00,6,63,"Yaoyao Yu, Tianyi Xia, Zhouli Tan, Huwei Xia, Shenping He, Han Sun, Xifan Wang, Haolan Song, Weijian Chen","2129418111, 1651654814, 2152252911, 2152252251, 2154572155, 2143527495, 2155087662, 2122643023, 1944459462",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30fd98944b72c8e5e86cd6dea2aa1aff7607a38b,Medicine,2129418111

Purpose: To determine the microbiology and outcomes of SAP in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) for patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: In this observational study, included patients were divided into SAP and non-SAP based on a comprehensive analysis of symptom, imaging, and laboratory results. Baseline characteristics, clinical characteristics, microbiology, and outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: Of 200 patients, 42.5% developed SAP after the onset of stroke, and they had a lower proportion of non-smokers (p = 0.002), lower GCS score (p < 0.001), higher serum CRP (p < 0.001) at ICU admission, and a higher proportion of males (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.039) than patients with non-SAP. Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (78.8%), followed by Gram-positive aerobic cocci (29.4%). The main pathogens included K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Burkholderia cepacia. SAP prolonged length of MV (p < 0.001), duration of ICU stay (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p = 0.027), shortened MV-free days by 28 (p < 0.001), and caused elevated vasopressor application (p = 0.001) and 60-day mortality (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis suggested that patients with coma (p < 0.001) have a higher risk of developing SAP. Conclusion: The microbiology of SAP is similar to early phase of HAP and VAP. SAP prolongs the duration of MV and length of ICU and hospital stays, but also markedly increases 60-day mortality.",Frontiers in Microbiology,journal,,25a655e4-17da-4bfc-a246-5cd20202068d,Frontiers in Microbiology,,12,N/A,2021,2021-12-03 00:00:00,12,51,"Jie Zhao, Lei-qing Li, Ning Zhen, L.

To define hallmarks of severe COVID-19 in acute disease ( n  = 58) and in disease recovery in convalescent patients ( n  = 28) from Hannover Medical School, we used flow cytometry and proteomics data with unsupervised clustering analyses. In our observational study, we combined analyses of immune cells and cytokine/chemokine networks with endothelial activation and injury. ICU patients displayed an altered immune signature with prolonged lymphopenia but the expansion of granulocytes and plasmablasts along with activated and terminally differentiated T and NK cells and high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The core signature of seven plasma proteins revealed a highly inflammatory microenvironment in addition to endothelial injury in severe COVID-19. Changes within this signature were associated with either disease progression or recovery. In summary, our data suggest that besides a strong inflammatory response, severe COVID-19 is driven by endothelial activation and barrier disruption, whereby recovery depends on the regeneration of the endothelial integrity.",Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy,journal,['JournalArticle'],660e7c97-71af-4d68-a87d-536a5ae0c644,Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy,,6,N/A,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,65,55,"L.

Methods: We performed a longitudinal analysis of CSVD and clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with primary ICH who had MRI. Baseline CSVD load (including white matter hyperintensities [WMH], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces [EPVS]) was evaluated. The cumulative CSVD score was calculated by combining the presence of each CSVD marker (range 0–4). We followed participants for poor functional outcome [modified Rankin scale [mRS] ≥ 4], stroke recurrence, and time-varying survival during a median follow-up of 4.9 [interquartile range [IQR] 3.1–6.0] years. Parsimonious and fuller multivariable logistic regression analysis and Cox-regression analysis were performed to estimate the association of CSVD markers, individually and collectively, with each outcome. Results: A total of 153 patients were included in the analyses. CMBs ≥ 10 [adjusted OR [adOR] 3.252, 95% CI 1.181–8.956, p = 0.023] and periventricular WMH (PWMH) (adOR 2.053, 95% CI 1.220–3.456, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with poor functional outcome. PWMH (adOR 2.908, 95% CI 1.230–6.878, p = 0.015) and lobar CMB severity (adOR 1.811, 95% CI 1.039–3.157, p = 0.036) were associated with stroke recurrence. The cumulative CSVD score was associated with poor functional outcome (adOR 1.460, 95% CI 1.017–2.096) and stroke recurrence (adOR 2.258, 95% CI 1.080–4.723). Death occurred in 36.1% (13/36) of patients with CMBs ≥ 10 compared with 18.8% (22/117) in those with CMB < 10 (adjusted HR 2.669, 95% CI 1.248–5.707, p = 0.011). In addition, the cumulative CSVD score ≥ 2 was associated with a decreased survival rate (adjusted HR 3.140, 95% CI 1.066–9.250, p = 0.038).

We pose a series of questions about the nature of SVD‐related cognitive impairments and provide answers based on a comprehensive review and meta‐analysis of published data from 69 studies. Although SVD is thought primarily to affect executive function and processing speed, we hypothesize that SVD affects all major domains of cognitive ability. We also identify low levels of education as a potentially modifiable risk factor for SVD‐related cognitive impairment. Therefore, we propose the use of comprehensive cognitive assessments and the measurement of educational level both in clinics and research settings, and suggest several recommendations for future research.",Alzheimer's & Dementia,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",c7d391f8-08f8-4dc2-8081-c3d96a19f620,Alzheimer's & Dementia,665 - 685,17,N/A,2020,2020-11-13 00:00:00,117,123,"Olivia K.

Based on extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (xDLVO) theory, the major fouling mechanisms, i.e., Lifshitz–van der Waals (LW), electrostatic (EL), and acid–base (AB) interactions, were for the first time quantitatively analyzed for model HA–bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures at different solution conditions. Results indicated that the pH, ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration of the solution significantly affected the physicochemical properties and the interaction energy between the polyethersulfone (PES) membrane and HA–BSA mixtures. The free energy of cohesion of the HA–BSA mixtures was minimum at pH = 3.0, ionic strength = 100 mM, and c(Ca2+) = 1.0 mM. The AB interaction energy was a key contributor to the total interaction energy when the separation distance between the membrane surface and HA–BSA mixtures was less than 3 nm, while the influence of EL interaction energy was of less importance to the total interaction energy. The attractive interaction energies of membrane–foulant and foulant–foulant increased at low pH, high ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration, thus aggravating membrane fouling, which was supported by the fouling experimental results. The obtained findings would provide valuable insights for the quantitative understanding of membrane fouling mechanisms of mixed organics during MF.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2018,2018-09-22 00:00:00,14,49,"Chunyi Sun, N.

The increase in produced water stresses the currently deployed deoiling technologies, resulting in more oil in the discharged water. Deploying membrane filtration to reduce the hydrocarbon concentration inherits additional complications related to fouling of the membranes: A process where the accumulation of material within and on the membrane surface adds additional flow resistance. This paper reviews and analyses the fouling detection, removal, prevention, dynamical and static modeling, with emphasis on how the membrane process can be manipulated from a process control perspective. The majority of the models rely on static descriptions or are limited to a narrow range of operating conditions which limits the usability of the models. This paper concludes that although the membrane filtration has been successfully applied and matured in many other industrial areas, challenges regarding cost-effective mitigation of fouling in the offshore deoiling applications, still exist. Fouling-based modeling combined with online parameter identification could potentially expand the operating range of the models and facilitate advanced control design to address transient performance and scheduling of fouling removal methods, resulting in cost-effective operation of membrane filtration systems. With the benefits of membrane filtration, it is predicted that membrane technology will be incorporated in produced water treatment, if the zero-discharge policies are enforced globally.",Water,journal,['Review'],2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2018,2018-06-26 00:00:00,110,139,"Kasper L.

However, the development of a flexible proximity sensor that can perform in a large range of object mobility remains a challenge. Here, a polymer-based sensor that utilizes a nanostructure composite as the sensing element has been presented for forthcoming usage in healthcare and automotive applications. Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)/Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) composites are capable of detecting presence of an external object in a wide range of distance. The proximity sensor exhibits an unprecedented detection distance of 120 mm with a resolution of 0.3%/mm. The architecture and manufacturing procedures of TPU/CNTs sensor are straightforward and performance of the proximity sensor shows robustness to reproducibility as well as excellent electrical and mechanical flexibility under different bending radii and over hundreds of bending cycles with variation of 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively. Tunneling and fringing effects are addressed as the sensing mechanism to explain significant capacitance changes. Percolation threshold analysis of different TPU/CNT contents indicated that nanocomposites having 2 wt% carbon nanotubes are exhibiting excellent sensing capabilities to achieve maximum detection accuracy and least noise among others. Fringing capacitance effect of the structure has been systematically analyzed by ANSYS Maxwell (Ansoft) simulation, as the experiments precisely supports the sensitivity trend in simulation.

The goal of this study is to create a forecasting workflow that increases prediction accuracy independent of the machine learning method and has minimal computational requirements. The proposed trend decomposition method incorporates irradiance and seasonal features as exogenous inputs. In order to extract the linear part of the data, a moving average filter is used. The nonlinear (stable) component of the time series is then calculated by subtracting this linear part from the original data. The stable portion is modeled using several machine learning methods, while the ordinary least squares method is applied to the linear series. By aggregating both results, the final forecast is obtained. The forecasting performances of the machine learning algorithms on unprocessed data are used as baselines for evaluations. Improvements up to 39% in the mean absolute error and up to 31% in the root mean square error metrics are observed compared to the baselines. Experimental results show that the proposed trend decomposition with extrapolation method increases the forecasting performance and generalization capacity of machine learning algorithms.",Energy Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],d757e504-289c-4242-967d-647bd71c352f,Energy Technology,,,N/A,2023,2023-12-09 00:00:00,5,23,"Gurcan Kavakci, Begum Cicekdag, S.

The difficulty of creating a yield forecast system is in the correct choice of predictors that have the greatest impact on yield.
To build the model, moisture in the 100 cm layer of the soil, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, humus, and soil acidity in the soil were used as input parameters. The amount of precipitation over 4 months, the average air temperature for the same period, as well as the presence of diseases, pests, and weeds were also taken into consideration. Data on 13 districts of the North Kazakhstan region in the period from 2008 to 2017 were used. The output parameter was the yield of spring wheat over the same time period.
The relative importance of input variables in relation to the output variable was used to determine the weight values of input variables.
An artificial neural network of error backpropagation was used as a method. The advantage of this method is that the quality of the forecast increases with a large amount of training data, as well as the ability to model nonlinear relationships between different data sources.
After training the artificial neural network and obtaining predictive data, good results were achieved for predicting wheat yields (p=0.52, mean absolute error in percentage (MAPE)=12.02 %, root mean square error (RMSE)=3.368).
Thus, it is assumed that the developed model for forecasting wheat yields based on data can be easily adapted for other crops and places and will allow the adoption of the right strategies to ensure food security",Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,journal,,405a8682-2b02-472d-9d89-0115f4e329bc,Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-30 00:00:00,12,59,"Gailya Aubakirova, V.

Systems require high accuracy, low cost, and low computational complexity prediction methods. Although exponential smoothing is an effective method, there is a lack of use with cellular networks and research on data traffic. The accuracy and suitability of this method need to be evaluated using several types of traffic. Thus, this study introduces the application of exponential smoothing as a method of adaptive forecasting of cellular network traffic for cases of voice (in Erlang) and data (in megabytes or gigabytes). Simple and Error, Trend, Seasonal (ETS) methods are used for exponential smoothing. By investigating the effect of their smoothing factors in describing cellular network traffic, the accuracy of forecast using each method is evaluated. This research comprises a comprehensive analysis approach using multiple case study comparisons to determine the best fit model. Different exponential smoothing models are evaluated for various traffic types in different time scales. The experiments are implemented on real data from a commercial cellular network, which is divided into a training data part for modeling and test data part for forecasting comparison. This study found that ETS framework is not suitable for hourly voice traffic, but it provides nearly the same results with Holt–Winter’s multiplicative seasonal (HWMS) in both cases of daily voice and data traffic. HWMS is presumably encompassed by ETC framework and shows good results in all cases of traffic. Therefore, HWMS is recommended for cellular network traffic prediction due to its simplicity and high accuracy.  ",Journal of Information and Communication Technologies,journal,,8647ec57-7e23-4bf6-8daf-83a8b917e700,Journal of Information and Communication Technology,,,N/A,2018,2018-12-11 00:00:00,24,14,"Quang Thanh Tran, Li Hao, Q.

We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, modelbased, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges.

Several screening methods, including electroencephalography, have been proposed to identify epileptic episodes. EEG data, which are frequently utilised to enhance epilepsy analysis, offer essential information on the electrical processes of the brain. Prior to the emergence of deep learning (DL), feature extraction was accomplished by standard machine learning techniques. As a result, they were only as good as the people who made the features by hand. But with DL, both feature extraction and classification are fully automated. These methods have significantly advanced several fields of medicine, including the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, the works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using ML and DL techniques are presented as well as their comparative analysis is done. The UCI-Epileptic Seizure Recognition dataset is used for training and validation. Some of the conventional ML and DL algorithms are used with a proposed model which uses long short-term memory (LSTM) to find the best approach. Post that comparative analysis is performed on these algorithms to find the best approach for epileptic seizure detection. As a result, the proposed model LSTM gives a validation accuracy of 97% giving the most appropriate and precise result as compared to other mentioned algorithms used in this study.",Journal of engineering and applied sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],e256e3ac-b37b-449d-a0cc-9b5202105c92,Journal of Engineering and Applied Science,,,N/A,2024,2024-01-19 00:00:00,17,25,"Pankaj Kunekar, Mukesh Kumar Gupta, Pramod Gaur","73674966, 2280763904, 2280594943",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a38f3d38bf9e1538343b615fb6429f38732ecbe2,"Computer Science, Medicine",73674966

The proper diagnosis of epilepsy is crucial due to its distinctive nature and the subsequent negative effects of epileptic seizures on patients. The classification of minimally pre-processed, raw multichannel EEG signal recordings is the foundation of this article’s unique method for identifying seizures in pre-adult patients. The new method makes use of the automatic feature learning capabilities of a three-dimensional deep convolution auto-encoder (3D-DCAE) associated with a neural network-based classifier to build an integrated framework that endures training in a supervised manner to attain the highest level of classification precision among brain state signals, both ictal and interictal. A pair of models were created and evaluated for testing and assessing our method, utilizing three distinct EEG data section lengths, and a tenfold cross-validation procedure. Based on five evaluation criteria, the labelled hybrid convolutional auto-encoder (LHCAE) model, which utilizes a classifier based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and an EEG segment length of 4 s, had the best efficiency. This proposed model has 99.08 ± 0.54% accuracy, 99.21 ± 0.50% sensitivity, 99.11 ± 0.57% specificity, 99.09 ± 0.55% precision, and an F1-score of 99.16 ± 0.58%, according to the publicly available Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB) dataset. Based on the obtained outcomes, the proposed seizure classification model outperforms the other state-of-the-art method’s performance in the same dataset.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,N/A,2023,2023-10-16 00:00:00,15,35,"S.

Early diagnosis of ASD can prevent from its severity and prolonged effects. Federated learning (FL) is one of the most recent techniques that can be applied for accurate ASD diagnoses in early stages or prevention of its long-term effects. In this article, FL technique has been uniquely applied for autism detection by training two different ML classifiers including logistic regression and support vector machine locally for classification of ASD factors and detection of ASD in children and adults. Due to FL, results obtained from these classifiers have been transmitted to central server where meta classifier is trained to determine which approach is most accurate in the detection of ASD in children and adults. Four different ASD patient datasets, each containing more than 600 records of effected children and adults have been obtained from different repository for features extraction. The proposed model predicted ASD with 98% accuracy (in children) and 81% accuracy (in adults).",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,N/A,2023,2023-06-13 00:00:00,73,60,"M.

a814dd75b527314e694805539d53faf5d9bf3b72,10.1155/2022/7751263,Review on Epileptic Seizure Prediction: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches,"Epileptic seizures occur due to brain abnormalities that can indirectly affect patient's health. It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world's population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.",Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",2ca1e2ac-8c3b-4251-94ed-24846d391d3b,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,,2022,N/A,2022,2022-01-20 00:00:00,53,84,"Milind Natu, M.

To study the robustness of language grounding to adversarial perturbations in machine vision and perception, we propose Show-and-Fool, a novel algorithm for crafting adversarial examples in neural image captioning. The proposed algorithm provides two evaluation approaches, which check if we can mislead neural image captioning systems to output some randomly chosen captions or keywords. Our extensive experiments show that our algorithm can successfully craft visually-similar adversarial examples with randomly targeted captions or keywords, and the adversarial examples can be made highly transferable to other image captioning systems. Consequently, our approach leads to new robustness implications of neural image captioning and novel insights in visual language grounding.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,,2587-2597,,20171e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,2017,2017-12-06 00:00:00,128,45,"Hongge Chen, Huan Zhang, Pin-Yu Chen, Jinfeng Yi, Cho-Jui Hsieh","2108270137, 49723481, 153191489, 2882166, 1793529",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96e53b9c4e7ce52b32f090ceb3b069786559a2b7,Computer Science,2108270137

Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],2ca4279c-8ed7-4280-8022-09e577923a09,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,14,N/A,2020,2020-05-13 00:00:00,229,78,"Dan Pan, An Zeng, L.

In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis has attached great significance to artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modalities of imaging data, T1-weighted MR and FDG-PET are widely used for this task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to integrate all the multi-modality information included in both T1-MR and FDG-PET images of the hippocampal area, for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, instead, it utilizes 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis or prognosis of AD. To test the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MR and FDG-PET images in the ADNI datasets, including 731 cognitively unimpaired (labeled as CN) subjects, 647 subjects with AD, 441 subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) and 326 subjects with progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI). We obtained higher accuracies of 90.10% for CN vs. AD task, 87.46% for CN vs. pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI vs. pMCI task. The proposed framework yields a state-of-the-art performance. Finally, the results have demonstrated that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite when using a CNN for the classification, (2) the combination of two modality imaging data generates better results.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],2ca4279c-8ed7-4280-8022-09e577923a09,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,13,N/A,2019,2019-02-26 00:00:00,203,64,"Yechong Huang, Jiahang Xu, Yuncheng Zhou, T.

Purpose of this paper
This paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies.


Design/methodology/approach
This briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context.


Findings
There are relatively minor disagreements such as whether to put milk in cups before or after the hot tea (answer: before). There are more serious disagreements such as Brexit, which has split the UK down the middle. But when it comes to sheer, visceral, instantaneous vitriol, nothing comes close to the reaction people have when someone turns the air conditioning up or down in an open plan office. One can predict that while one half of the room are eternally grateful for the “blessed relief”, the other half will turn apoplectic with anger at the worsening conditions. There rarely seems to be a happy medium.


Practical implications
Provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world’s leading organizations.


What is original/value of paper?
The briefing saves busy executives and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy-to-digest format.

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling chemistry at unprecedented computational speeds given accurate reference data. However, certain tasks, such as charge assignment, do not have a unique solution. Herein, we use a machine learning algorithm to discover a new charge assignment model by learning to replicate molecular dipole moments across a large, diverse set of nonequilibrium conformations of molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms. The new model, called Affordable Charge Assignment (ACA), is computationally inexpensive and predicts dipoles of out-of-sample molecules accurately. Furthermore, dipole-inferred ACA charges are transferable to dipole and even quadrupole moments of much larger molecules than those used for training. We apply ACA to dynamical trajectories of biomolecules and produce their infrared spectra. Additionally, we find that ACA assigns similar charges to Charge Model 5 but with greatly reduced computational cost.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,journal,['JournalArticle'],45c7ef3c-e436-428b-a856-c8d5b31b603b,The journal of physical chemistry letters,"

However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations. Simultaneous accurate and efficient prediction of molecular properties relies on combined quantum mechanics and machine learning approaches. Here the authors develop a flexible machine-learning force-field with high-level accuracy for molecular dynamics simulations.",Nature Communications,journal,['JournalArticle'],43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,9,N/A,2018,2018-02-26 00:00:00,621,75,"Stefan Chmiela, H.

However, its specific pathogenesis has not been clarified. This study aimed to identify biomarkers for OA diagnosis and elucidate their potential mechanisms for restoring OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis in vitro. Material and methods Two publicly available transcriptomic mRNA OA-related datasets (GSE10575 and GSE51588) were explored for biomarker identification by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). We applied the GSE32317 and GSE55457 cohorts to validate the markers’ efficacy for diagnosis. The connections of markers to chondrocyte autophagy and apoptosis in OA were also comprehensively explored in vitro using molecular biology approaches, including qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results We identified 286 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were enriched in the ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. After external cohort validation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, PDK1 was finally identified as a diagnostic marker for OA. The pharmacological properties of BX795-downregulated PDK1 expression inhibited LPS-induced chondrocyte inflammation and apoptosis and rescued OA-dysregulated autophagy. Additionally, the phosphorylation of the mediators associated with the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways was significantly downregulated, indicating the regulatory function of PDK1 in apoptosis and autophagy via MAPK and PI3K/AKT-associated signaling pathways in chondrocytes. A significantly positive association between the PDK1 expression and Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Plasma cells, and activated CD4 memory T cells, as well as an evident negative correlation between T cells follicular helper and CD4 naive T cells, were detected in the immune cell infiltration analysis. Conclusions PDK1 can be used as a diagnostic marker for OA. Inhibition of its expression can rescue OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibit apoptosis by reducing the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,13,N/A,2023,2023-01-06 00:00:00,11,43,"Jinzhi Meng, Huawei Du, Haiyuan Lv, Jinfeng Lu, Jia Li, Jun Yao","2153309361, 2199519898, 2140466182, 2115405513, 2118372427, 2109801692",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12d9dc29928fff4157ad8c3bdb56a6f263914743,"Biology, Medicine",2153309361

In recent years, some studies have shown that the pathological process of OA chondrocytes is related to ferroptosis. Our study aims to identify and validate differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) in OA chondrocytes and to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms. RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by four methods: limma-voom, edgeR, DESeq2, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interactions (PPI), and cytoHubba of Cytoscape were applied to identify hub genes. Clinical OA cartilage specimens were collected for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting (WB), histological staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and transfection. Sankey diagram was used to visualize the relationships between the expression level of SLC3A2 in the damaged area and clinical factors. Based on bioinformatics analysis, clinical factors, and experiment validation, SLC3A2 was identified as a hub gene. It was down-regulated in OA cartilage compared to normal cartilage (p < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that SLC3A2 was associated with ferroptosis-related functions. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression level of SLC3A2 in the OA cartilage-damaged area was closely related to BMI, obesity grade, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Furthermore, in vitro experiments validated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA.

The incidence of OA is rising because of the ageing population and the epidemic of obesity. This research was designed for the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers for OA and analyzing the possible association between critical genes and infiltrated immune cells. 10 OA samples from patients with spinal OA and 10 normal samples were collected. GSE55235 and GSE55457 datasets including human OA and normal samples were downloaded from the GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between 20 OA and 20 controls. SVM-RFE analysis and LASSO regression model were carried out to screen possible markers. The compositional patterns of the 22 types of immune cell fraction in OA were determined by the use of CIBERSORT. The expression level of the biomarkers in OA was examined by the use of RT-PCR. In this study, an overall 44 DEGs were identified: 18 genes were remarkably upregulated and 26 genes were distinctly downregulated. KEGG pathway analyses revealed that pathways were significantly enriched including IL-17 signal path, rheumatoid arthritis, TNF signal path, and lipid and atherosclerosis. Based on the results of machine learning, we identified APOLD1 and EPYC as critical diagnostic genes in OA, which were further confirmed using ROC assays. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that APOLD1 was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Moreover, we found that EPYC was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Overall, our findings might provide some novel clue for the exploration of novel markers for OA diagnosis. The critical genes and their associations with immune infiltration may offer new insight into understanding OA developments.",Journal of Immunological Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],8277b418-515d-4a95-b1cd-467da11bdad9,Journal of Immunology Research,,2022,N/A,2022,2022-06-13 00:00:00,24,29,"Yihao Liang, F.

Therefore, it is of great significance to explore OA biomarkers for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of OA. Methods and materials The GSE129147, GSE57218, GSE51588, GSE117999, and GSE98918 datasets with normal and OA samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GSE117999 and GSE98918 datasets were integrated, and immune infiltration was evaluated. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the limma package in R, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore the co-expression genes and co-expression modules. The co-expression module genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, and hub genes were identified by the degree, MNC, closeness, and MCC algorithms. The hub genes were used to construct a diagnostic model based on support vector machines. Results The Immune Score in the OA samples was significantly higher than in the normal samples, and a total of 2313 DEGs were identified. Through WGCNA, we found that the yellow module was significantly positively correlated with the OA samples and Immune Score and negatively correlated with the normal samples. The 142 DEGs of the yellow module were related to biological processes such as regulation of inflammatory response, positive regulation of inflammatory response, blood vessel morphogenesis, endothelial cell migration, and humoral immune response. The intersections of the genes obtained by the 4 algorithms resulted in 5 final hub genes, and the diagnostic model constructed with these 5 genes showed good performance in the training and validation cohorts.

This study aimed to determine the mechanistic similarities and differences between OA and RA by integrated analysis of multiple gene expression data sets. Microarray data sets of OA and RA were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). By integrating multiple gene data sets, specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of DEGs were conducted to determine hub genes and pathways. The “Cell Type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT)” algorithm was employed to evaluate the immune infiltration cells (IICs) profiles in OA and RA. Moreover, mouse models of RA and OA were established, and selected hub genes were verified in synovial tissues with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A total of 1116 DEGs were identified between OA and RA. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were enriched in regulation of cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, positive regulation of neuron differentiation, nuclear speck, RNA polymerase II transcription factor complex, protein serine/threonine kinase activity and proximal promoter sequence-specific DNA binding. KEGG pathway analysis showed that DEGs were enriched in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, FoxO signaling pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway. Immune cell infiltration analysis identified 9 IICs with significantly different distributions between OA and RA samples. qPCR results showed that the expression levels of the hub genes (RPS6, RPS14, RPS25, RPL11, RPL27, SNRPE, EEF2 and RPL19) were significantly increased in OA samples compared to their counterparts in RA samples (P < 0.05).

The aims of this study were to analyze if synovial inflammation is already present in early OA and to characterize the involved cell populations, by investigating synovial fluid (SF) and synovial membrane (SM) of early OA patients for the presence and polarization status of CD4 T cells. Methods A quantitative analysis of CD4 + T cell infiltration in SF and SM compared to peripheral blood (PB) was performed in patients with early stages of OA. We further investigated intracellular staining (ICS), surface marker, and chemokine receptor expression profiles of CD4 + T cells in SF, SM, and PB, as well as cytokine expression in native SF and PB. Matched samples of SF, SM, and PB were harvested from 40 patients with early OA at the time of surgery. Early OA was confirmed by independent surgeons intraoperatively. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for surface markers and cytokines, which are preferentially expressed by distinct T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells). Furthermore, we analyzed native SF and PB supernatants using MACSPlex for multiple cytokine expression profiles. Results SF and SM showed a distinct infiltration of CD4 + T lymphocytes, with significantly increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3/CCR5, cytokine IFN-γ (preferentially expressed by Th1 cells), and CD161 (preferentially expressed by IL-17 producing Th17 cells) compared to PB. Furthermore, the percentage of CD4 + T cells polarized to Treg was significantly increased in SM compared to SF and PB. No significant differences were observed for CCR3 and CCR4 (preferentially expressed by Th2 cells), although IL-4 values were significantly higher in SM and SF compared to PB. Cytokine analysis showed comparable results between PB and SF, with only IL-6 being significantly increased in SF. Conclusions Early OA joints show already significant inflammation through CD4 + T cell infiltration, with predominant Th1 cell polarization. Inflammation seems to be driven by direct proinflammatory cell interaction. Cytokine signaling seems to be negligible at the site of inflammation in early OA, with only IL-6 being significantly increased in SF compared to PB.",Arthritis Research & Therapy,journal,['JournalArticle'],72dca55a-55b5-4189-ab00-57c1bdb44a53,Arthritis Research & Therapy,,23,N/A,2021,2021-01-22 00:00:00,40,59,"N.

The application of integrated omics to exploring robust signatures for clinical translation is increasingly highlighted, attributed to the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade in diverse malignancies. However, effective tools to comprehensively interpret multi-omics data is still warranted to provide increased granularity into intrinsic mechanism of oncogenesis and immunotherapeutic sensitivity. Results We developed a computational tool for effective Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR), providing comprehensive investigation of estimation of reported or user-built signatures, TME deconvolution and signature construction base on multi-omics data. Notably, IOBR offers batch analyses of these signatures and their correlations with clinical phenotypes, lncRNA profiling, genomic characteristics and signatures generated from single-cell RNA sequencing data in different cancer settings. Additionally, IOBR also integrates multiple existing microenvironmental deconvolution methodologies and signature construction tools for convenient comparison and selection.

We aimed to uncover the intrinsic expression profiles correlating with prognostic genetic abnormalities by WGCNA. Methods We downloaded the clinical and expression dataset from BeatAML, TCGA and GEO database. Using R (version 4.0.2) and ‘WGCNA’ package, the co-expression modules correlating with the ELN2017 prognostic markers were identified (R 2  ≥ 0.4, p < 0.01). ORA detected the enriched pathways for the key co-expression modules. The patients in TCGA cohort were randomly assigned into the training set (50%) and testing set (50%). The LASSO penalized regression analysis was employed to build the prediction model, fitting OS to the expression level of hub genes by ‘glmnet’ package. Then the testing and 2 independent validation sets (GSE12417 and GSE37642) were used to validate the diagnostic utility and accuracy of the model. Results A total of 37 gene co-expression modules and 973 hub genes were identified for the BeatAML cohort. We found that 3 modules were significantly correlated with genetic markers (the ‘lightyellow’ module for NPM1 mutation, the ‘saddlebrown’ module for RUNX1 mutation, the ‘lightgreen’ module for TP53 mutation). ORA revealed that the ‘lightyellow’ module was mainly enriched in DNA-binding transcription factor activity and activation of HOX genes. The ‘saddlebrown’ module was enriched in immune response process. And the ‘lightgreen’ module was predominantly enriched in mitosis cell cycle process. The LASSO- regression analysis identified 6 genes (NFKB2, NEK9, HOXA7, APRC5L, FAM30A and LOC105371592) with non-zero coefficients. The risk score generated from the 6-gene model, was associated with ELN2017 risk stratification, relapsed disease, and prior MDS history. The 5-year AUC for the model was 0.822 and 0.824 in the training and testing sets, respectively. Moreover, the diagnostic utility of the model was robust when it was employed in 2 validation sets (5-year AUC 0.743–0.79).

Intact cartilage was enriched for homeostatic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, while damaged cartilage was enriched for prefibro- and fibro-, regulatory, reparative and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. A total of 61 cytokines and growth factors were predicted to regulate the 7 chondrocyte cell phenotypes. Based on production by > 1% of cells, 55% of the cytokines were produced by synovial cells (39% exclusive to synoviocytes and not expressed by chondrocytes) and their presence in osteoarthritic synovial fluid confirmed. The synoviocytes producing IL-1beta (a classic pathogenic cytokine in osteoarthritis), mainly inflammatory macrophages and dendritic cells, were characterized by co-expression of surface proteins corresponding to HLA-DQA1 , HLA-DQA2 , OLR1 or TLR2 .

The use of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) in concrete is an effective way to minimize environmental pollution. RCA does not gain more attraction because of the availability of adhered mortar on its surface, which poses a harmful effect on the properties of concrete. However, a suitable mix design for RCA enables it to reach the targeted strength and be applicable for a wide range of construction projects. The targeted strength achievement from the proposed mix design at a laboratory is also a time-consuming task, which may cause a delay in the construction work. To overcome this flaw, the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, gene expression programming (GEP), and artificial neural network (ANN) was employed in this study to predict the compressive strength of RCA-based concrete. The linear coefficient correlation (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were evaluated to investigate the performance of the models. The k-fold cross-validation method was also adopted for the confirmation of the model’s performance. In comparison, the GEP model was more effective in terms of prediction by giving a higher correlation (R2) value of 0.95 as compared to ANN, which gave a value of R2 equal to 0.92. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to know about the contribution level of each parameter used to run the models. Moreover, the increment in data points and the use of other supervised ML approaches like boosting, gradient boosting, and bagging to forecast the compressive strength, would give a better response.",Buildings,journal,,f2c78b1b-6bcc-4700-859b-af9401c02941,Buildings,,,N/A,2021,2021-07-27 00:00:00,145,38,"Ayaz Ahmad, K.

However, no method is available to date to predict the compressive strength (CS) of rice husk ash blended concrete (RHAC). In this study, advanced machine learning techniques (artificial neural network, artificial neuro-fuzzy inference system) were used to predict the CS of RHAC. Based on the published literature, six inputs, i.e., age of specimen, percentage of rice husk ash, percentage of superplasticizer, aggregates, water, and amount of cement, were selected. Results obtained from machine learning methods were compared with traditional methods such as linear and non-linear regressions. It was observed that the performance of machine learning methods was superior to traditional methods for determining the CS of RHAC. This study will prove beneficial in minimizing the cost and time of executing laboratory experiments for designing the optimum content portions of RHAC.",Crystals,,,b8e01b74-69da-47f0-83fa-961a1041b25c,Crystals,,,Unknown,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,42,40,"M.

However, the conventional fitting algorithms are not suitable for accurate estimation of wetting properties, especially on hydrophilic surfaces, due to optical distortions triggered by changes in the focal length of the moving drops. Therefore, here we present an original setup coupled with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for estimation of Contact Angle (CA). The developed algorithm is trained on 3375 ground truth images (at different front-lit illuminations), less sensitive to the edges of the drops, and retains its stability for images that are synthetically blurred with higher Gaussian Blurring (GB) values (GB: 0–22) if compared to existing goniometers (GB: 0–12). Besides, the proposed technique can precisely analyze drops of various colors and chemistries on different surfaces. Finally, our automated orthogonal camera goniometer has a significantly lower average standard deviation (6.7° vs. 14.6°) and coefficient of variation (14.9 vs. 29.2%) than the existing techniques and enables wettability assessment of non-spherical drops on heterogeneous surfaces.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,N/A,2023,2023-01-27 00:00:00,103,76,"Hossein Kabir, Nakul Garg","2202754992, 26945165",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16a20fd181dc2701add002cf05682df8b1bc304c,"Computer Science, Engineering, Materials Science, Medicine",2202754992

Therefore, choosing a reasonable set of parameters for accurate advance rate prediction is paramount to reduce cutter wear and improve tunneling efficiency. However, since the geological parameters in mixed ground conditions are diverse and uncertain, the prediction of the advance rate (AR) of EPB shield tunneling is significantly more difficult than that in homogeneous ground (i.e., full-face hard-rock ground). In addition, the operating parameters of the EPB shield tunneling can be subjective and suboptimal, and each of them has some intricate influence on AR. In this paper, an optimized back-propagation neural network by genetic algorithm (BPNN-GA) was proposed for reasonable operating parameter selection and accurate AR prediction, and four typical machine learning methods were used for comparison. Five processing strategies with different input parameters were also proposed and compared to determine the optimum selection of geological parameters in mixed ground conditions. The proposed models with strategies were adopted in the case study of the Nanjing Metro Line S6 project, and a total of 1188 rings of datasets were used for this study. The results showed that the proposed modified BPNN with the genetic algorithm could be effectively implemented for the AR prediction. It concluded that Strategy B—i.e., using the composite ratio and the geological parameters of each layer as input—was the best strategy in mixed ground conditions for advance rate prediction.

Artificial intelligence is a multidimensional technology with various components such as advanced algorithms, ML and DL. Together, AI, ML, and DL are expected to provide automated devices to ophthalmologists for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders in the near future. In fact, AI, ML, and DL have been used in ophthalmic setting to validate the diagnosis of diseases, read images, perform corneal topographic mapping and intraocular lens calculations. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the 3 most common causes of irreversible blindness on a global scale. Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively detect the progression of a number of pathologies including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders. There are 2 methods of imaging used as diagnostic methods in ophthalmic practice: fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Of note, OCT has become the most widely used imaging modality in ophthalmology settings in the developed world. Changes in population demographics and lifestyle, extension of average lifespan, and the changing pattern of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, DR, AMD, and glaucoma create a rising demand for such images. Furthermore, the limitation of availability of retina specialists and trained human graders is a major problem in many countries. Consequently, given the current population growth trends, it is inevitable that analyzing such images is time‐consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Therefore, the detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders through unmanned automated applications system in the near future will be inevitable. We provide an overview of the potential impact of the current AI, ML, and DL methods and their applications on the early detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic diseases.",Asia - Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology,Unknown,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",Unknown,Asia-Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology,264–272,8,Unknown,2019,2019-06-01 00:00:00,173,94,"L.

The data have been collected from the roads of Patiala City, Punjab, India; during the years 2012–2015, the network of 16 roads have been selected for the data collection purposes. The data have been divided into two sets, that is, training dataset (data collected during the years 2012 and 2013) and validation dataset (data collected during the years 2014 and 2015). The two fitness functions have been used for the evaluation of the models, that is, coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE), and it is inferred that GP models predict with high accuracy for pavement distress and help the decision makers for adequate and timely fund allocations for preservation of the urban road network.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Advances in Civil Engineering,1-15,2018,Unknown,2018,2018-03-29 00:00:00,30,34,"T.

Hence, it is very important to improve prediction accuracy. There is a rutting depth as a major indicator showing the state of pavement used in PMS. In this research, we propose a method to predict rutting depth by introducing a technique to improve prediction accuracy by suppressing over-fitting by dropout and gradient clipping in the recently rapidly developing NN (Neural Network) model. In addition, since pavement survey data are time series data that were inspected at the same place multiple times, we applied the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model which can model time series data. The proposed method was applied to rutting depth prediction of periodic survey data of Kawasaki city in Japan from 1987 to 2016. In order to compare prediction accuracy, we predicted three years later using proposed method and MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) which is a typical regression model and MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) which is most frequently used among NN models. The RMSE and correlation coefficient R between the prediction result and the measured value were compared. We validated that the prediction ability of RNN is the highest.",,Unknown,['Review'],Unknown,,16-21,3,Unknown,2017,2017-12-29 00:00:00,7,0,"Tomoyuki Okuda, Kouyu Suzuki, N.

Three types of deterioration models are currently being used in the existing PMS: site-specific, family, and expert opinion curves. These curves are developed using deterministic techniques. In the deterministic technique, the uncertainties of pavement deterioration related to traffic and weather are not considered. Probabilistic models that take into account the uncertainties result in more accurate curves. In this study, probabilistic models using the discrete-time Markov process were developed for five distress indices: transverse, longitudinal, fatigue, rut, and ride indices, as a case study on low-volume roads. Regression techniques were used to develop the deterioration paths using the predicted distribution of indices estimated from the Markov process. Results indicated that longitudinal, fatigue, and rut indices had very slow deterioration over time, whereas transverse and ride indices showed faster deterioration. The developed deterioration models had the coefficient of determination (R2) above 0.84. As probabilistic models provide more accurate results, it is recommended that these models be used as the family curves in the CDOT PMS for low-volume roads.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Advances in Civil Engineering,1-9,2017,Unknown,2017,2017-11-19 00:00:00,37,16,"Promothes Saha, K.

Kernel principal component analysis combined with logistic regression test (KPCA-LRT) has been successfully used in classifying gene expression data. Nevertheless, the purpose of association study is to detect the correlation between genetic variations and disease rather than to classify the sample, and the genomic data is categorical rather than numerical. Recently, although the kernel-based logistic regression model in association study has been proposed by projecting the nonlinear original SNPs data into a linear feature space, it is still impacted by multicolinearity between the projections, which may lead to loss of power. We, therefore, proposed a KPCA-LRT model to avoid the multicolinearity.ResultsSimulation results showed that KPCA-LRT was always more powerful than principal component analysis combined with logistic regression test (PCA-LRT) at different sample sizes, different significant levels and different relative risks, especially at the genewide level (1E-5) and lower relative risks (RR = 1.2, 1.3). Application to the four gene regions of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) data from Genetic Analysis Workshop16 (GAW16) indicated that KPCA-LRT had better performance than single-locus test and PCA-LRT.ConclusionsKPCA-LRT is a valid and powerful gene- or region-based method for the analysis of GWAS data set, especially under lower relative risks and lower significant levels.",BMC Genetics,journal,['JournalArticle'],cc8cdfd1-81f1-4a3f-abf0-72d6a3f2859a,BMC Genetics,75 - 75,12,N/A,2011,2011-08-26 00:00:00,23,53,"Qingsong Gao, Yungang He, Zhongshang Yuan, Jinghua Zhao, Bingbing Zhang, F.

A full-scale experimental program consisting of six reinforced concrete slabs with compressive strengths of 60 MPa, 50 MPa and 40 MPa, measuring 1.0 m × 1.0 m × 0.08 m, and subjected to 2.7 kg of non-confined plastic bonded explosive, was conducted in blast test area of Science and Technology Aerospace Department (Brazilian Air Force). This paper compares experimentally measured peak displacement values with theoretical values. Theoretical analysis was carried out using single degree of freedom (SDOF) models. The comparison showed that SDOF analysis worked very well in predicting the reinforced concrete slab peak displacement against blast effects.

The majority of these are in non-coding regions, and are commonly assigned to the nearest gene along the genome. However, this approach neglects the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and the fact that the genome contains arrays of extremely conserved non-coding elements termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which can be utilized to detect genes under long-range developmental regulation. Here we review a GRB-based approach to assign loci in non-coding regions to potential target genes, and apply it to reanalyse the results of one of the largest schizophrenia GWAS (SWG PGC, 2014). We further apply this approach to GWAS data from two related neuropsychiatric disorders—autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder—to show that it is applicable to developmental disorders in general. We find that disease-associated SNPs are overrepresented in GRBs and that the GRB model is a powerful tool for linking these SNPs to their correct target genes under long-range regulation. Our analysis identifies novel genes not previously implicated in schizophrenia and corroborates a number of predicted targets from the original study. The results are available as an online resource in which the genomic context and the strength of enhancer–promoter associations can be browsed for each schizophrenia-associated SNP.",Molecular Psychiatry,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3ef1d4dd-9ec8-4e05-9172-dfc4dedac8ef,Molecular Psychiatry,6 - 18,25,N/A,2019,2019-10-15 00:00:00,24,90,"Ana Barešić, Alexander J.

We used extensive, empirically-driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests, and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency <10% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with ≥80% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies >25%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called “Winner’s Curse”, was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) which led to more accurate effect size estimation.

Here, we used transcriptome profiling in 1,012 yeast segregants to map the genetic basis of variation in gene expression with high statistical power. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that together account for over 70% of the total genetic contribution to variation in mRNA levels, allowing us to examine the sources of regulatory variation comprehensively. We found that variation in the expression of a typical gene has a complex genetic architecture involving multiple eQTL. We also detected hundreds of eQTL pairs with significant non-additive interactions in an unbiased genome-wide scan. Although most genes were influenced by a local eQTL located close to the gene, most expression variation arose from distant, trans-acting eQTL located far from their target genes. Nearly all distant eQTL clustered at 102 “hotspot” locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes and altered expression of their target genes though both direct and indirect mechanisms. Many local eQTL had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in trans. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.",bioRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,eLife,,7,N/A,2017,2017-10-24 00:00:00,134,127,"F.

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.",Nature,journal,['JournalArticle'],6c24a0a0-b07d-4d7b-a19b-fd09a3ed453a,Nature,204 - 213,550,N/A,2017,2017-10-11 00:00:00,3379,81,"François Andrew A.

Most studies use single marker linear regression to discover primary signals, followed by sequential conditional modeling to detect secondary genetic variants affecting gene expression. However, this approach assumes that functional variants are sparsely distributed and that close linkage between them has little impact on estimation of their precise location and the magnitude of effects. We describe a series of simulation studies designed to evaluate the impact of linkage disequilibrium (LD) on the fine mapping of causal variants with typical eQTL effect sizes. In the presence of multisite regulation, even though between 80 and 90% of modeled eSNPs associate with normally distributed traits, up to 10% of all secondary signals could be statistical artifacts, and at least 5% but up to one-quarter of credible intervals of SNPs within r2 > 0.8 of the peak may not even include a causal site. The Bayesian methods eCAVIAR and DAP (Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors) provide only modest improvement in resolution. Given the strong empirical evidence that gene expression is commonly regulated by more than one variant, we conclude that the fine mapping of causal variants needs to be adjusted for multisite influences, as conditional estimates can be highly biased by interference among linked sites, but ultimately experimental verification of individual effects is needed. Presumably similar conclusions apply not just to eQTL mapping, but to multisite influences on fine mapping of most types of quantitative trait.","G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics",journal,['JournalArticle'],fa24e304-ead1-4f50-9fa8-8049a0a3bb19,G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics,2533 - 2544,7,N/A,2016,2016-10-29 00:00:00,26,75,"B.

Institutions are working hard primarily for their survival and gradually for their stability and long-run businesses for the future. The education and training existing in urban areas and it is in rural areas differ in many respects. Technical Education in urban areas and it is in rural as well as remote rural has diversified thoughts in terms of enrollment issues of the students. It is urgent to know the interests of the students and participants, as well as why and how they are attracted to go for technical education or the general stream in the community. It is realized that there are relatively not only fewer students but also a smaller proportion of students in the enrollment. It seems like there are various areas that the current government should focus on for the sake of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) development regarding the enrollment issues in the Technical Education in Community Schools (TECS) modality program.

There is, however, still a dearth of study about whether graduate students acquire the employability skills that businesses want of them because of their higher education. To determine a student's future employment and career path, it is critical to evaluate their soft skills. An emerging area called educational data mining (EDM) aims to gather enormous volumes of academic data produced and maintained by educational institutions and to derive explicit and specific information from it. This paper aims to predict students' soft skills such as professional, analytical, linguistic, communication, and ethical skills, based on their socio-economic, academic, and institutional data by leveraging data mining methods and machine learning techniques. All five soft skills were predicted using prediction models created using linear regression, probabilistic neural networks, and simple regression tree techniques. This study used a dataset from an open source that Universidad Technologica de Bolivar published. It covers academic, social, and economic data for 12,411 students. The experimental results demonstrated that the linear regression algorithm performed better than the others in predicting all five soft skills compared to machine learning methods. This finding can assist higher education institutions in making informed decisions, providing tailored support, enhancing student success and employability, and continuously modifying their programs to meet the needs of students.",JOIV: International Journal on Informatics Visualization,journal,['JournalArticle'],0fa5fb50-57a4-4633-aa8f-91804e20ac17,JOIV : International Journal on Informatics Visualization,,,N/A,2023,2023-11-30 00:00:00,2,0,"Rathimala Kannan, Chew Chin Jet, Kannan Ramakrishnan, Sujatha Ramdass","2066417170, 2276693112, 26945108, 2276696902",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e43ff4d7efb4a5216f20ed5acb57929a97c759ae,"Computer Science, Economics, Education",2066417170

To predict students' employability before graduation, machine learning models were employed. These include logistic regression; decision tree, random forest, and an unsupervised clustering (K-Means) algorithm. This research, therefore, aims to predict the full-time employability of undergraduate students based on academic and experience employability attributes – including cumulative grade point average (CGPA), student industrial work experience scheme (SIWES), co-curricular activities, gender, and union groupings before graduation. Primary datasets of 218 graduate students in the last four academic calendar years (2016 – 2021) from the Computer Science Department of Federal University Dutse were rated. The results demonstrate that Random Forest Classifier predict students employability the best with an accuracy of 98% and f1-score of 0.99 compare to logistic regression and decision tree. Furthermore, using more students’ data with more attributes including academics and extracurricular activities can improve the models performance and predict students’ employability.  ",UMYU Scientifica,Unknown,,Unknown,UMYU Scientifica,,,Unknown,2023,2023-02-13 00:00:00,8,0,"Muhammad Hadiza Baffa, Muhammad Abubakar Miyim, Abdullahi Sani Dauda","2206579178, 2206591424, 2206417094",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a7d0d30cfaef2f7d43e229b49e89d53877a10e9,"Computer Science, Education",2206579178

The present study investigated important predictors in determining the satisfaction of undergraduate students (N = 425) from multiple departments in using ERL at a self-funded university in Hong Kong while Moodle and Microsoft Team are the key learning tools. By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores. The results suggest that the need of reviewing the quality and quantity of modified assessment accommodated for ERL and structured class delivery with the suitable amount of interactive learning according to the learning culture and program nature.",PLoS ONE,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,16,N/A,2021,2021-04-02 00:00:00,125,93,"I.

It is particularly difficult for governments in low-income countries, where informal industry is responsible for a large amount of pollution, because the governments lack the ability to locate and monitor large numbers of dispersed polluters. This study demonstrates an accurate, scalable machine-learning approach for identifying brick kilns, a highly polluting informal industry in Bangladesh, in satellite imagery. Our data reveal widespread violations of the national regulations governing brick manufacturing, which has implications for the health and well-being of the country. Our approach offers a low-cost, replicable method for regulatory agencies to generate information on key pollution sources. Improving compliance with environmental regulations is critical for promoting clean environments and healthy populations. In South Asia, brick manufacturing is a major source of pollution but is dominated by small-scale, informal producers who are difficult to monitor and regulate—a common challenge in low-income settings. We demonstrate a low-cost, scalable approach for locating brick kilns in high-resolution satellite imagery from Bangladesh. Our approach identifies kilns with 94.2% accuracy and 88.7% precision and extracts the precise GPS coordinates of every brick kiln across Bangladesh. Using these estimates, we show that at least 12% of the population of Bangladesh (>18 million people) live within 1 km of a kiln and that 77% and 9% of kilns are (illegally) within 1 km of schools and health facilities, respectively. Finally, we show how kilns contribute up to 20.4 μg/m3 of PM2.5 (particulate matter of a diameter less than 2.5 μm) in Dhaka when the wind blows from an unfavorable direction. We document inaccuracies and potential bias with respect to local regulations in the government data.

Until recently, its extent was poorly understood and no tools existed for systematically detecting forced labor risk on individual fishing vessels on a global scale. Here we use satellite data and machine learning to identify these high-risk vessels and find widespread risk of forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet. This information provides new opportunities for unique market, enforcement, and policy interventions. This also provides a proof of concept for how remotely sensed dynamic individual behavior can be used to infer forced labor abuses. While forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet has been widely documented, its extent remains unknown. No methods previously existed for remotely identifying individual fishing vessels potentially engaged in these abuses on a global scale. By combining expertise from human rights practitioners and satellite vessel monitoring data, we show that vessels reported to use forced labor behave in systematically different ways from other vessels. We exploit this insight by using machine learning to identify high-risk vessels from among 16,000 industrial longliner, squid jigger, and trawler fishing vessels. Our model reveals that between 14% and 26% of vessels were high-risk, and also reveals patterns of where these vessels fished and which ports they visited. Between 57,000 and 100,000 individuals worked on these vessels, many of whom may have been forced labor victims. This information provides unprecedented opportunities for novel interventions to combat this humanitarian tragedy.

Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activities in rural and remote locations may provide heightened opportunities to conceal the alleged human rights violations associated with mining, such as: hazardous working conditions, health impacts, child labour, child trafficking, and debt bondage. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method, teamed with high temporal frequency Sentinel-1 imagery, for monitoring ASM activity in rural locations of the “Copperbelt”, the DRC. The results show that the ISBAS descriptive variables (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) were significantly different (p-value = ≤ 0.05) between mining and non-mining areas. Additionally, a significant difference was found for the ISBAS descriptive variables mean, standard deviation, and minimum between the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnels). As expected, a high level of subsidence (i.e., negative ISBAS pixel value) was a clear indicator of mine activity. Trial activity thresholds were set for the descriptive variables mean (-2.43 mm/yr) and minimum (-5.36 mm/yr) to explore an ISBAS approach to active mine identification. The study concluded that the ISBAS method has great potential as a monitoring tool for ASM, with the ability to separate mining and non-mining areas based on surface motion values, and further distinguish the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnel). Ground data collection and further development of ISBAS analysis needs to be made to fully understand the value of an ISBAS-based ASM monitoring system.

Using remote sensing methods, the location and impacts of fish-processing activities were assessed within a case study of Bangladesh’s Sundarbans mangrove forests. Ten fish-processing camps were identified, with some occurring in locations where human activity is banned. Environmental degradation included the removal of mangroves, erosion, and the destruction of protected areas. Previous studies have identified cases of labour exploitation and modern slavery occurring within the Sundarbans, and remote sensing was used to triangulate these claims by providing spatial and temporal analysis to increase the understanding of the operational trends at these locations. These findings were linked to the cyclical relationship between modern slavery and environmental degradation, whereby environmental damage is both a driver and result of workers subjected to modern slavery. Remote sensing can be used as an additional methodological tool to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and provide evidence to support the promotion of the “freedom dividend” which would have far-reaching economic, social, cultural, and environmental benefits.

Brick kilns, facilities for producing fired clay-bricks for construction are often found at peri-urban region of South Asian cities. Although brick kilns are significant air pollutant emitters, their contribution in under-represented in air pollution emission inventories due to unavailability of their distribution. This research overcomes this gap by proposing publicly available remote sensing dataset based approach for mapping brick-kiln locations using object detection and pixel classification. As brick kiln locations are not permanent, an open-dataset based methodology is advantageous for periodically updating their locations. Brick kilns similar to Bull Trench Kilns were identified using the Sentinel-2 imagery around the state of Delhi in India. The unique geometric and spectral features of brick kilns distinguish them from other classes such as built-up, vegetation and fallow-land even in coarse resolution imagery. For object detection, transfer learning was used to overcome the requirement of huge training datasets, while for pixel-classification random forest algorithm was used. The method achieved a recall of 0.72, precision of 0.99 and F1 score of 0.83. Overall 1564 kilns were detected, which are substantially higher than what was reported in an earlier study over the same region. We find that brick kilns are located outside urban areas in proximity to outwardly expanding built-up areas and tall built structures. Duration of brick kiln operation was also estimated by analyzing the time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the brick kiln locations. The brick kiln locations can be further used for updating land-use emission inventories to assess particulate matter and black carbon emissions.",ISPRS Int. J.

In order to ensure the implementation of this global agenda, the UN proposed a systematic follow-up and review through indicator-based tracking and reporting of the progress with statistical and geospatial information toward SDGs at national, regional, and global levels. This has posed many technical and institutional challenges. Although international communities have devoted great attention to this hot topic, most of their work has focused on the conceptual design and preliminary testing. There are very few good practices for a comprehensive measurement and assessment of progress toward SDGs with the integration of statistical and geospatial information at national or local levels. This paper presents the methodology and results of a pioneer project which measured the progress toward SDGs at a local level in China (i.e., Deqing County) by integrating statistical and geospatial information. In this study, a number of technical/institutional issues have been tackled, such as the adoption of appropriate indicators at a local level, availability and acquisition of reliable data sets, and spatiotemporal analysis with a geographical perspective, interaction between SDGs and cross-sector coordination. The major conclusions are (a) the comprehensive progress toward SDGs in Deqing can be most appropriately measured and assessed by integrating geospatial and statistical information; (b) Deqing has made significant economic and social advances while maintaining a good ecological environment over the past few years.

Recycling the world’s increasing debris has taken on critical importance. Pyrolysis is one of the most practical techniques for recycling plastic because of its intrinsic qualities and environmental friendliness. For scale-up and reactor design, an understanding of the degradation process is essential. Using one model-free kinetic approach (Friedman) and two model-fitting kinetic methods (Arrhenius and Coats-Redfern), the thermal degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) microplastics at heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 °C/min was examined in this work. Additionally, a powerful artificial neural network (ANN) model was created to forecast the heat deterioration of PET MPs. At various heating rates, the TG and DTG thermograms from the PET MPs degradation revealed the same patterns and trends. This showed that the heating rates do not impact the decomposition processes. The Friedman model showed activation energy values ranging from 3.31 to 8.79 kJ/mol. The average activation energy value was 1278.88 kJ/mol from the Arrhenius model, while, from the Coats-Redfern model, the average was 1.05 × 104 kJ/mol. The thermodynamics of the degradation process of the PET MPs by thermal treatment were all non-spontaneous and endergonic, and energy was absorbed for the degradation. It was discovered that an ANN, with a two-layer hidden architecture, was the most effective network for predicting the output variable (mass loss%) with a regression coefficient value of (0.951–1.0).",Processes,,,939ba3df-4270-4ba0-ad98-ffe889f3546e,Processes,,,Unknown,2023,2023-02-07 00:00:00,24,33,"T.

The present study focuses on the identification, characterization, and quantification techniques for tracking microplastics. Due to their unique compositional structure, unambiguous identification of individual polymers in various plastic samples, usually comprised of mixtures of individual polymers, remains a challenge. Therefore, there is limited research on the pyrolysis characterization of mixed samples. In this study, two analytical methods, TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS combined with thermogravimetric analysis were used to evaluate the thermal-degradation process of individual and mixed samples of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The primary interaction was the volatilization of terephthalic acid bound to chlorine molecules. The reduction of vinyl-ester functional groups and aromatic hydrocarbon intermediates related to olefin branching was confirmed. Char formation was increased, due to aromatic compounds from PET and PVC. All of the polymers used in the study may be underestimated in quantity, due to combined volatilizations during pyrolysis. TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS showed forceful advantages in identifying mixed microplastics through different discrimination mechanisms. The study provides deep insight into pyrolysis behaviors and the interactions of mixed polymers, and the obtained results can help better comprehend the complex pyrolysis process.",Polymers,journal,['JournalArticle'],4efb9ad7-9740-4922-b9c8-c29376ca2223,Polymers,,15,N/A,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,21,59,"M.

The train and test datasets were obtained from jar test experimentation on the petroleum industry effluent (PIE) sample using aluminum sulfate (AS) as the coagulant. The ML algorithm from scikit-learn was employed to determine the optimum operating condition for the removal of colloidal particles, causing turbidity in the PIE. The predictive capacity of four ML models was compared based on their statistical metrics for clean discharge. The predicted optimum condition corresponds to pH (10), dosage (0.1 g/L), and settling time (30 min) which transcends to residual turbidity ≤ 10 NTU and translates to 95% removal efficiency. The second-order AS-sweep flocculation kinetic showed that at the predicted optimum conditions, modeled rate constant of 1.33 × 10−3 L/g.min and flocculation period of 1.2 min reduced the combination of the monomer, dimmer, and trimmer class colloids from an initial 570 mg/L concentration to the residual counts of 24 mg/L corresponding to residual turbidity ≤ 10 NTU under the mixing regime 14 s−1 ≤ G ≤ 164 s−1 satisfied the EPA standard for clean effluent discharge. It incorporated the selected ML output with time-evolution and aggregation kinetics to define sedimentation tank geometry for cleaner discharge. The findings from the design-driven optimization recommended a flow rate (1000 m3s−1), coefficient of kinematic viscosity (0.841 mm/s), and the required detention time (30–60 min) to define the sedimentation tank geometry.

It demonstrates that in recent years pyrolysis kinetics has turned into a major application of the thermokinetics. Analysis of the respective publications suggests that too often their quality leaves much to be desired because of the poor choices of the kinetic methods and experimental conditions. It is explained that the proper choices can be made by following the recommendations of the International Confederation for Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (ICTAC). To help with improving the quality of the kinetic results, the ICTAC recommendations are condensed to a few easy to follow principles. These principles focus on selecting proper computational methods, collecting better experimental data, and efficiently reporting the results. The paramount computational principle is to avoid using the methods that evaluate the activation energy and other kinetic parameters from the data measured at a single heating rate. It is shown that the kinetic parameters evaluated by such methods can give rise to striking examples of failure when estimating the thermal stability at ambient temperature. Because of the vital importance of pyrolysis kinetics studies from an ecological and economical perspective, a substantial improvement of their quality is currently needed.",Thermo,,['Review'],029c59a0-4a97-42c5-b890-c75af9be881b,Thermo,,,Unknown,2022,2022-11-28 00:00:00,32,107,"N.

Considering the large volume of common Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, this paper presents a strategy to accurately identify the ionospheric amplitude scintillation events utilizing the measurements collected with geodetic GNSS receivers. The proposed detection method relies on a pre-trained machine learning decision tree algorithm, leveraging the scintillation index computed from the carrier-to-noise data and elevation angles collected at 1-Hz. The experimental results using real data demonstrate a 99% accuracy in scintillation detection can be achieved. By combining advanced machine learning techniques with geodetic GNSS receivers, this approach is feasible to effectively detect ionospheric scintillation using non-scintillation GNSS receivers.

Global positioning system scintillation and total electron content (TEC) data have been collected by ten specialized GPS Ionospheric Scintillation and TEC Monitors (GISTMs) of the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN). The phase scintillation index σΦ is obtained from the phase of the L1 signal sampled at 50 Hz. Maps of phase scintillation occurrence as a function of the altitude-adjusted corrected geomagnetic (AACGM) latitude and magnetic local time (MLT) are computed for the period from 2008 to 2013. Enhanced phase scintillation is collocated with regions that are known as ionospheric signatures of the coupling between the solar wind and magnetosphere. The phase scintillation mainly occurs on the dayside in the cusp where ionospheric irregularities convect at high speed, in the nightside auroral oval where energetic particle precipitation causes field-aligned irregularities with steep electron density gradients and in the polar cap where electron density patches that are formed from a tongue of ionization. Dependences of scintillation occurrence on season, solar and geomagnetic activity, and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation are investigated. The auroral phase scintillation shows semiannual variation with equinoctial maxima known to be associated with auroras, while in the cusp and polar cap the scintillation occurrence is highest in the autumn and winter months and lowest in summer. With rising solar and geomagnetic activity from the solar minimum to solar maximum, yearly maps of mean phase scintillation occurrence show gradual increase and expansion of enhanced scintillation regions both poleward and equatorward from the statistical auroral oval. The dependence of scintillation occurrence on the IMF orientation is dominated by increased scintillation in the cusp, expanded auroral oval and at subauroral latitudes for strongly southward IMF. In the polar cap, the IMF BY polarity controls dawn–dusk asymmetries in scintillation occurrence collocated with a tongue of ionization for southward IMF and with sun-aligned arcs for northward IMF. In investigating the shape of scintillation-causing irregularities, the distributions of scintillation occurrence as a function of ""off-meridian"" and ""off-shell"" angles that are computed for the receiver–satellite ray at the ionospheric pierce point are found to suggest predominantly field-aligned irregularities in the auroral oval and L-shell-aligned irregularities in the cusp.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Annales Geophysicae,531-545,33,Unknown,2015,2015-05-13 00:00:00,69,72,"P.

As a result, electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity as they are independent of oil and do not produce greenhouse gases. However, despite their benefits, several operational issues still need to be addressed for EV adoption to become widespread. This research delves into the evolution of EVs over time and highlights their benefits, including reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. It also explores the challenges and difficulties faced in their adoption, such as the high cost of infrastructure, scarcity of charging stations, limited range or range anxiety, and the performance of batteries. To overcome these challenges, potential solutions include enhancing the charging infrastructure, increasing the number of charging stations, using battery swapping techniques, and improving battery technology to address range anxiety and reduce charging times. Governments can incentivize consumers to purchase EVs through tax credits or subsidies and invest in building a robust charging infrastructure. Industry stakeholders can collaborate with governments to address these challenges and promote the adoption of EVs, which can contribute to reducing carbon emissions and air pollution.",Applied Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-05-13 00:00:00,274,91,Fayez Alanazi,119669844,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0b5c8dbc1f3e76f73ad77277bddafb44da4b8e1,"Economics, Engineering, Environmental Science",119669844

In the recent era of COVID-19 pandemic, this nonhuman, machine-based technology has gained a lot of momentum. The supercomputers and robotics with AI technology have shown the potential to equal or even surpass human experts’ accuracy in some tasks in the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) is prompting massive data interweaving with elements from many digital sources such as medical imaging sorting, electronic health records, and transforming healthcare delivery. But in thoracic surgical and our counterpart pulmonary medical field, AI’s main applications are still for interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung histopathological slide evaluation, physiological data interpretation, and biosignal testing only. The query arises whether AI-enabled technology-based or autonomous robots could ever do or provide better thoracic surgical procedures than current surgeons but it seems like an impossibility now.

It is detected by trained microscopists who analyze microscopic blood smear images. Modern deep learning techniques may be used to do this analysis automatically. The need for the trained personnel can be greatly reduced with the development of an automatic accurate and efficient model. In this article, we propose an entirely automated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for the diagnosis of malaria from the microscopic blood smear images. A variety of techniques including knowledge distillation, data augmentation, Autoencoder, feature extraction by a CNN model and classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are performed under three training procedures named general training, distillation training and autoencoder training to optimize and improve the model accuracy and inference performance. Our deep learning-based model can detect malarial parasites from microscopic images with an accuracy of 99.23% while requiring just over 4600 floating point operations. For practical validation of model efficiency, we have deployed the miniaturized model in different mobile phones and a server-backed web application. Data gathered from these environments show that the model can be used to perform inference under 1 s per sample in both offline (mobile only) and online (web application) mode, thus engendering confidence that such models may be deployed for efficient practical inferential systems.",Diagnostics,,['JournalArticle'],1944b6e1-2c1d-4f42-88e3-9f8a52f57e47,Diagnostics,,10,Unknown,2020,2020-05-01 00:00:00,117,80,"K.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a signal that measures the electric activity of the heart. The proposed approach is implemented using ML-libs and Scala language on Apache Spark framework; MLlib is Apache Spark’s scalable machine learning library. The key challenge in ECG classification is to handle the irregularities in the ECG signals which is very important to detect the patient status. Therefore, we have proposed an efficient approach to classify ECG signals with high accuracy Each heartbeat is a combination of action impulse waveforms produced by different specialized cardiac heart tissues. Heartbeats classification faces some difficulties because these waveforms differ from person to another, they are described by some features. These features are the inputs of machine learning algorithm. In general, using Spark–Scala tools simplifies the usage of many algorithms such as machine-learning (ML) algorithms. On other hand, Spark–Scala is preferred to be used more than other tools when size of processing data is too large. In our case, we have used a dataset with 205,146 records to evaluate the performance of our approach. Machine learning libraries in Spark–Scala provide easy ways to implement many classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forests, Gradient-Boosted Trees (GDB), etc.). The proposed method is evaluated and validated on baseline MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia database. The results show that our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 96.75% using GDB Tree algorithm and 97.98% using random Forest for binary classification. For multi class classification, it achieved to 98.03% accuracy using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting tree supports only binary classification.",Journal of Big Data,journal,['JournalArticle'],d60da343-ab92-4310-b3d7-2c0860287a9d,Journal of Big Data,,6,N/A,2019,2019-08-31 00:00:00,163,21,"Fajr Ibrahem Alarsan, Mamoon Younes","1381648299, 1383260029",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5fbcbb07cc300f7e08bfdd1c1620d0ed05906576,"Computer Science, Medicine",1381648299

However, the application of convolutional networks has been proposed only very recently and has remained largely unexplored. In this paper we describe a convolutional neural network architecture for functional connectome classification called connectome-convolutional neural network (CCNN). Our results on simulated datasets and a publicly available dataset for amnestic mild cognitive impairment classification demonstrate that our CCNN model can efficiently distinguish between subject groups. We also show that the connectome-convolutional network is capable to combine information from diverse functional connectivity metrics and that models using a combination of different connectivity descriptors are able to outperform classifiers using only one metric. From this flexibility follows that our proposed CCNN model can be easily adapted to a wide range of connectome based classification or regression tasks, by varying which connectivity descriptor combinations are used to train the network.",Front.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of AD. Therefore, patients with MCI who are at high risk of fully developing AD should be identified to accurately predict AD. However, the relationship between brain images and AD is difficult to construct because of the complex characteristics of neuroimaging data. To address this problem, we present a longitudinal measurement of MCI brain images and a hierarchical classification method for AD prediction. Longitudinal images obtained from individuals with MCI were investigated to acquire important information on the longitudinal changes, which can be used to classify MCI subjects as either MCI conversion (MCIc) or MCI non-conversion (MCInc) individuals. Moreover, a hierarchical framework was introduced to the classifier to manage high feature dimensionality issues and incorporate spatial information for improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated using 131 patients with MCI (70 MCIc and 61 MCInc) based on MRI scans taken at different time points. Results showed that the proposed method achieved 79.4% accuracy for the classification of MCIc versus MCInc, thereby demonstrating very promising performance for AD prediction.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,7,N/A,2017,2017-01-12 00:00:00,60,52,"Meiyan Huang, Wei Yang, Qianjin Feng, Wufan Chen, M.

However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions. Method: First, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of AD subjects. Coefficients of MIE with values higher than 0.98 quantile were highlighted to obtain the discriminant regions that distinguish AD from NC. Results: The experiments showed that the proposed method can predict AD subjects with a competitive performance with existing methods, especially the accuracy of the polynomial kernel (92.36 ± 0.94) was better than the linear kernel of 91.47 ± 1.02 and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of 86.71 ± 1.93. The proposed eigenbrain-based CAD system detected 30 AD-related brain regions (Anterior Cingulate, Caudate Nucleus, Cerebellum, Cingulate Gyrus, Claustrum, Inferior Frontal Gyrus, Inferior Parietal Lobule, Insula, Lateral Ventricle, Lentiform Nucleus, Lingual Gyrus, Medial Frontal Gyrus, Middle Frontal Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Paracentral Lobule, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Postcentral Gyrus, Posterial Cingulate, Precentral Gyrus, Precuneus, Subcallosal Gyrus, Sub-Gyral, Superior Frontal Gyrus, Superior Parietal Lobule, Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, Thalamus, Transverse Temporal Gyrus, and Uncus). The results were coherent with existing literatures. Conclusion: The eigenbrain method was effective in AD subject prediction and discriminant brain-region detection in MRI scanning.",Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,journal,['JournalArticle'],8c456f98-9892-42ac-9b16-418755f01550,Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,,9,N/A,2015,2015-06-02 00:00:00,256,88,"Yudong Zhang, Z.

The above problems mean that the manufacturing industry knowledge utilization rate is low. This paper proposes a novel Chinese fine-grained NER (named entity recognition) method based on symmetry lightweight deep multinetwork collaboration (ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF) and model transfer considering active learning (MTAL) to research fine-grained named entity recognition of a few labeled Chinese textual data types. The method is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF was applied for verification in the CLUENER2020 dataset (Public dataset) to get a pretrained model; the experiments show that the model obtains an F1 score of 0.8962, which is better than the best baseline algorithm, an improvement of 9.2%. In the second stage, the pretrained model was transferred into the Manufacturing-NER dataset (our dataset), and we used the active learning strategy to optimize the model effect. The final F1 result of Manufacturing-NER was 0.8931 after the model transfer (it was higher than 0.8576 before the model transfer); so, this method represents an improvement of 3.55%. Our method effectively transfers the existing knowledge from public source data to scientific target data, solving the problem of named entity recognition with scarce labeled domain data, and proves its effectiveness.",Symmetry,journal,['JournalArticle'],1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,1986,12,N/A,2020,2020-11-30 00:00:00,20,48,"Liguo Yao, Haisong Huang, Kuan-Wei Wang, Shih-Huan Chen, Qiaoqiao Xiong","113765846, 2899585, 3723159, 153064823, 2041658772",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53d1c4cce25c5d9f74b0c1c8a32341e69752ebfe,"Computer Science, Engineering",113765846

The recognition of named entities based on Chinese is more complicated and difficult than English, which makes the task of NER in Chinese more challenging. In particular, fine-grained named entity recognition is more challenging than traditional named entity recognition tasks, mainly because fine-grained tasks have higher requirements for the ability of automatic feature extraction and information representation of deep neural models. In this paper, we propose an innovative neural network model named En2BiLSTM-CRF to improve the effect of fine-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks. This proposed model including the initial encoding layer, the enhanced encoding layer, and the decoding layer combines the advantages of pre-training model encoding, dual bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and a residual connection mechanism. Hence, it can encode information multiple times and extract contextual features hierarchically. We conducted sufficient experiments on two representative datasets using multiple important metrics and compared them with other advanced baselines. We present promising results showing that our proposed En2BiLSTM-CRF has better performance as well as better generalization ability in both fine-grained and coarse-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2020,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,45,"Jingang Liu, Chunhe Xia, Haihua Yan, Wenjing Xu","49721680, 2056988799, 48506966, 2152921552",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9e45d4a6b3de0186e2cb430ecf01dcf17697342,Computer Science,49721680

Named entity recognition is a natural language processing task carried out to obtain morpheme sequences with specific meanings, such as person, location, and organization names. Although morphological analysis and named entity recognition are closely associated with each other, they have been independently studied and have exhibited the inevitable error propagation problem. Hence, we propose an integrated model based on label attention networks that simultaneously performs morphological analysis and named entity recognition. The proposed model comprises two layers of neural network models that are closely associated with each other. The lower layer performs a morphological analysis, whereas the upper layer performs a named entity recognition. In our experiments using a public gold-labeled dataset, the proposed model outperformed previous state-of-the-art models used for morphological analysis and named entity recognition.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has shown promising performance in tackling feature selection problems, but still faces challenges in dealing with large-scale feature selection in Big Data environment because of the large search space. Hence, this article proposes a bi-directional feature fixation (BDFF) framework for PSO and provides a novel idea to reduce the search space in large-scale feature selection. BDFF uses two opposite search directions to guide particles to adequately search for feature subsets with different sizes. Based on the two different search directions, BDFF can fix the selection states of some features and then focus on the others when updating particles, thus narrowing the large search space. Besides, a self-adaptive strategy is designed to help the swarm concentrate on a more promising direction for search in different stages of evolution and achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on 12 widely-used public datasets show that BDFF can improve the performance of PSO on large-scale feature selection and obtain smaller feature subsets with higher classification accuracy.",IEEE Transactions on Big Data,journal,['JournalArticle'],9cc701cf-1f49-4121-8ea9-11bac24d61ad,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,1004-1017,9,N/A,2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,23,60,"Jia-Quan Yang, Qi-Te Yang, Ke-Jing Du, Chun-Hua Chen, Hua Wang, Sang-Woon Jeon, Jinchao Zhang, Zhi-hui Zhan","2167905528, 2187161662, 2196699, 2168924226, 2197900893, 1699638, 27672597, 1680620",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b94342c6c5a493f8bad55c030ab1319c05b597a6,Computer Science,2167905528

b90b44ae435f87a729913439bde57fb4e7f6a69f,10.3390/s23010272,A New Approach to Optimize SVM for Insulator State Identification Based on Improved PSO Algorithm,"The failure of insulators may seriously threaten the safe operation of the power system, where the state detection of high-voltage insulators is a must for the normal and safe operation of the power system. Based on the data of insulators in aerial images, this work explored an enhanced particle swarm algorithm to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine. A support vector machine model was therefore established for the identification of the normal and defective states of the insulators. This methodology works with the structure minimization principle of SVM and the characteristics of particle swarm fast optimization. First, the aerial insulator image was segmented as a target by way of the seed region growth based on double-layer cascade morphological improvements, and then, HOG features plus GLCM features were extracted as sample data. Finally, an ameliorated PSO-SVM classifier was designed to realize insulator state identification. Comparisons were made between PSO-SVM and conventional machine learning algorithms, SVM and Random Forest, and an optimization algorithm, Gray Wolf Optimization Support Vector Machine (GWO-SVM), and advanced neural network CNN. The experimental results showed that the performance of the algorithm proposed in this paper touched the top level, where the recognition accuracy rate was 92.11%, the precision rate 90%, the recall rate 94.74%, and the F1-score 92.31%.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-12-27 00:00:00,16,54,"Lepeng Song, Qingxue Liang, Hui Chen, Hao Hu, Yu Luo, Yanling Luo","3139123, 30562891, 2161727522, 2118879421, 2150627127, 2202922088",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b90b44ae435f87a729913439bde57fb4e7f6a69f,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",3139123

To overcome the shortcomings in the existing university teaching quality assessment procedure, this paper designs an evaluation model for physical education departments based on long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). The model is constructed by analyzing the connotation and index system of teacher education teaching quality and constructing a fan-leaf structure model of teacher education teaching quality. Then, an improved PSO-LSTM model is proposed to train the teaching samples. The evaluation model applies the improved LSTM model and optimizes the network structure by dynamically adjusting the learning rate. The model is then optimized for the number of neurons and iterations of the network using the improved PSO. The results of the experiment indicate that the proposed model is effective in evaluating the quality of physical education. Moreover, the model analysis’ accuracy has greatly improved. This helps teachers have a comprehensive understanding of classroom dynamics and improve their professional competence and classroom teaching quality.",International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems,journal,,2670b208-aca8-45b3-8a07-dba73daff0bf,International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems,,,N/A,2022,2022-09-13 00:00:00,4,23,"Zhaohui Qu, Jiexiu Yin","2185017825, 2185065953",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e12a1a98320c783bddbda2e13a0e10cb3dbd29c,"Computer Science, Education, Engineering",2185017825

Speakers are used to emit human inaudible acoustic signals, and the echo is recorded via microphones, turning the acoustic system of a smart phone into a sonar system. The echo signal can be used to profile user interaction with the device. For example, a victim’s finger movements can be inferred to steal Android unlock patterns. In our empirical study, the number of candidate unlock patterns that an attacker must try to authenticate herself to a Samsung S4 phone can be reduced by up to 70% using this novel acoustic side-channel. The attack is entirely unnoticeable to victims. Our approach can be easily applied to other application scenarios and device types.

Target-side monolingual data plays an important role in boosting fluency for phrase-based statistical machine translation, and we investigate the use of monolingual data for NMT. In contrast to previous work, which combines NMT models with separately trained language models, we note that encoder-decoder NMT architectures already have the capacity to learn the same information as a language model, and we explore strategies to train with monolingual data without changing the neural network architecture. By pairing monolingual training data with an automatic back-translation, we can treat it as additional parallel training data, and we obtain substantial improvements on the WMT 15 task English German (+2.8-3.7 BLEU), and for the low-resourced IWSLT 14 task Turkish->English (+2.1-3.4 BLEU), obtaining new state-of-the-art results.

Previous work addresses the translation of out-of-vocabulary words by backing off to a dictionary. In this paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, making the NMT model capable of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as sequences of subword units. This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,ArXiv,,abs/1508.07909,20151e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,2015,2015-08-31 00:00:00,7471,42,"Rico Sennrich, B.

Energy use depends upon various factors, such as climate, household characteristics, and behavior. Of these, income, education, and size of the family are very vital socio-economic factors that depict energy consumption levels and their pattern. The utmost objective of this research project was to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to analyze household energy consumption trends in the USA, integrating socioeconomic factors such as income, family size, and education. The dataset retrieved from Kaggle integrates detailed weather patterns with energy consumption data, putting into perspective the interaction between climatic variables and household energy use. It included key features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, along with time-series data on energy consumption metrics like electricity and natural gas usage at the household level. It provided information on several geographic zones across extended periods, so seasonality and regional variations may be studied. It was complemented with metadata that included timestamps, energy pricing, and household attributes and should therefore be a rich resource for predictive modeling and extracting relationships between weather conditions and energy demand. For this research project, three models were selected: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, each possessing particular strengths for the nature of the problem. This study employed key performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy. The Random Forest model had the highest value for accuracy, similarly, the highest AUC was for the Random Forest with the best AUC. As such, it was concluded that the Random Forest model provided the best trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate and can be relied upon for this classification task. The machine learning models generate valuable predictions about household energy use. Particularly, Random Forest models, which are trained on socioeconomic and weather data to predict the likelihood of a given household having high energy usage. The predictions by such models can be used to help energy providers determine when to invoke tiered pricing or encourage energy-saving behavior.",The American Journal of Engineering and Technology,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,The American Journal of Engineering and Technology,,,Unknown,2024,2024-12-19 00:00:00,9,0,"Muhammad Shoyaibur Rahman Chowdhury, Mohammad Saiful Islam, Md Abdullah Al Montaser, M.

We intended to investigate nonlinear relationships typical of the atmospheric variables using state-of-the-art ML methods for more accurate rainfall predictions. For this research project on rainfall forecasting in the USA, we utilized an extensive dataset that comprises historical rainfall data collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other meteorological agencies. The main dataset we use in this paper consists of daily rainfall measurements across various geographical locations of the USA, thus capturing the wide-ranging historical data necessary for both training and validation of the model. Besides measuring rainfall, we included meteorological data from sources such as NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications. These datasets further provided key variables that are known to affect rain, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The performance metrics used in this research work for the models considered include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The above table shows that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other models, achieving perfect accuracy. That indicated that it rightly classified all the instances in the test set. The Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models gave a quite good performance by giving above average accuracy but had lower precision and recall for the rainfall prediction. Accurate rainfall forecasting has direct consequences on agriculture, greatly empowering farmers and agricultural planners to make more effective decisions regarding planting, harvesting, and crop management. The forecasts of rainfall are also of critical importance in disaster management regarding planning for flood emergencies. Moreover, precise forecasting of rainfall, particularly in sustainable water resources management, presents the most important data in planning for and conserving these resources.",Journal of Environmental and Agricultural Studies,journal,['JournalArticle'],b843beae-7645-4217-9445-0f380ec83b64,Journal of Environmental and Agricultural Studies,,,N/A,2024,2024-11-09 00:00:00,7,0,"Abdullah Al Mukaddim, MD Rashed Mohaimin, Mohammad Abir Hider, Mitu Karmakar, Md Nasiruddin, Shah Alam, Farhana Rahman Anonna","2324999202, 2330095522, 2324991673, 2327913220, 2300776156, 2330092919, 2330094449",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfca42eafdd857b52a16778a31b49e35e1b7e353,"Computer Science, Environmental Science",2324999202

The disproportionate spatial accumulation of a drug in the interstitium is determined by several microenvironmental properties (blood vessel distribution and permeability, gradients in the interstitial fluid pressure). Predictions of tumour perfusion are key determinants of drug delivery and responsiveness to therapy. Pharmacokinetic models allow for the quantification of tracer perfusion based on contrast enhancement measured with non-invasive imaging techniques. An advanced cross-voxel exchange model (CVXM) was recently developed to provide a comprehensive description of tracer extravasation as well as advection and diffusion based on cross-voxel tracer kinetics (Sinno et al 2021). Transport parameters were derived from DCE-MRI of twenty TS-415 human cervical carcinoma xenografts by using CVXM. Tracer velocity flows were measured at the tumour periphery (mean 1.78–5.82 μm.s−1) pushing the contrast outward towards normal tissue. These elevated velocity measures and extravasation rates explain the heterogeneous distribution of tracer across the tumour and its accumulation at the periphery. Significant values for diffusivity were deduced across the tumours (mean 152–499 μm2.s−1). CVXM resulted in generally smaller values for the extravasation parameter Kext (mean 0.01–0.04 min−1) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction ve (mean 0.05–0.17) compared to the standard Tofts parameters, suggesting that Toft model underestimates the effects of inter-voxel exchange. The ratio of Tofts’ extravasation parameters over CVXM’s was significantly positively correlated to the cross-voxel diffusivity (P < 0.0001) and velocity (P = 0.0005). Tofts’ increased ve measurements were explained using Sinno et al (2021)’s theoretical work. Finally, a scan time of 15 min renders informative estimations of the transport parameters. However, a duration as low as 7.5 min is acceptable to recognize the spatial variation of transport parameters. The results demonstrate the potential of utilizing CVXM for determining metrics characterizing the exchange of tracer between the vasculature and the tumour tissue. Like for many earlier models, additional work is strongly recommended, in terms of validation, to develop more confidence in the results, motivating future laboratory work in this regard.",Physics in Medicine and Biology,journal,['JournalArticle'],d5594aad-095f-4587-802a-b011732c7100,Physics in Medicine & Biology,,67,N/A,2022,2022-11-22 00:00:00,2,56,"N.

Some of the most common models employed in clinical practice, such as the standard Tofts model (STM) or the extended Tofts model (ETM), do not account for passive delivery of contrast agent (CA) through diffusion. In this work, we introduce a diffusive term based on the concept of effective diffusivity into a finite element (FE) implementation of the ETM formulation, obtaining a new formulation for the diffusion-corrected ETM (D-ETM). A gradient-based optimization algorithm is developed to characterize the vascular properties of the tumour from the CA concentration curves obtained from imaging clinical data. To test the potential of our approach, several theoretical distributions of CA concentration are generated on a benchmark problem and a real tumour geometry. The vascular properties used to generate these distributions are estimated from an inverse analysis based on both the ETM and the D-ETM approaches. The outcome of these analyses shows the limitations of the ETM to retrieve accurate parameters in the presence of diffusion. The ETM returns smoothed distributions of vascular properties, reaching unphysical values in some of them, while the D-ETM accurately depicted the heterogeneity of KTrans, ve\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$_{e}$$\end{document} and vp\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$_{p}$$\end{document} distributions (mean absolute relative difference (ARD) of 16%, 15% and 9%, respectively, for the real geometry case) keeping all their values within their physiological ranges, outperforming the ETM.",Engineering computations,journal,['JournalArticle'],47ba6266-85d0-494a-a55a-927f8c599119,Engineering with Computers,3849 - 3865,38,N/A,2022,2022-06-01 00:00:00,7,41,"D.

Here, we propose 10 “rules” centered on 2 best practice components: clean code and testing. These 2 areas are relatively straightforward and provide substantial utility relative to the learning investment. Adopting clean code practices helps to standardize and organize software code in order to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load for both the initial developer and subsequent contributors; this allows developers to concentrate on core functionality and reduce errors. Clean coding styles make software code more amenable to testing, including unit tests that work best with modular and consistent software code. Unit tests interrogate specific and isolated coding behavior to reduce coding errors and ensure intended functionality, especially as code increases in complexity; unit tests also implicitly provide example usages of code. Other forms of testing are geared to discover erroneous behavior arising from unexpected inputs or emerging from the interaction of complex codebases. Although conforming to coding styles and designing tests can add time to the software development project in the short term, these foundational tools can help to improve the correctness, quality, usability, and maintainability of open-source scientific software code. They also advance the principal point of scientific research: producing accurate results in a reproducible way. In addition to suggesting several tips for getting started with clean code and testing practices, we recommend numerous tools for the popular open-source scientific software languages Python, R, and Julia.",PLoS Comput.

Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects; while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body’s immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data; predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.",Vaccines,,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",057c6386-3be2-4649-8e9d-95d09e29102a,Vaccines,,9,Unknown,2021,2021-05-26 00:00:00,173,56,"Ma’mon M.

Furthermore, the performance of genetic factors in predicting dyslipidaemia has not been explored. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate prediction models with and without genetic factors for dyslipidaemia in rural populations. A total of 3596 individuals from the Henan Rural Cohort Study were included in this study. According to the ratio of 7:3, all individuals were divided into a training set and a testing set. The conventional models and conventional+GRS (genetic risk score) models were developed with Cox regression, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifiers in the training set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI) were used to assess the discrimination ability of the models, and the calibration curve was used to show calibration ability in the testing set. Compared to the lowest quartile of GRS, the hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of individuals in the highest quartile of GRS was 1.23(1.07, 1.41) in the total population. Age, family history of diabetes, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were used to develop the conventional models, and the AUCs of the Cox, ANN, RF, and GBM classifiers were 0.702(0.673, 0.729), 0.736(0.708, 0.762), 0.787 (0.762, 0.811), and 0.816(0.792, 0.839), respectively. After adding GRS, the AUCs increased by 0.005, 0.018, 0.023, and 0.015 with the Cox, ANN, RF, and GBM classifiers, respectively. The corresponding NRI and IDI were 25.6, 7.8, 14.1, and 18.1% and 2.3, 1.0, 2.5, and 1.8%, respectively.

If not, they could be uncurable and deadly. Due to this reason, there is a need of analysing complex medical data, medical reports, and medical images at a lesser time but with greater accuracy. There are even some instances where certain abnormalities cannot be directly recognized by humans. In healthcare for computational decision making, machine learning approaches are being used in these types of situations where a crucial data analysis needs to be performed on medical data to reveal hidden relationships or abnormalities which are not visible to humans. Implementing algorithms to perform such tasks itself is difficult, but what makes it even more challenging is to increase the accuracy of the algorithm while decreasing the required time for the algorithm to execute. In the early days, processing of large amount of medical data was an important task which resulted in machine learning being adapted in the biological domain. Since this happened, the biology and biomedical fields have been reaching higher levels by exploring more knowledge and identifying relationships which were never observed before. Reaching to its peak now the concern is being diverted towards treating patients not only based on the type of disease but also their genetics, which is known as precision medicine. Modifications in machine learning algorithms are being performed and tested daily to improve the performance of the algorithms in analysing and presenting more accurate information. In the healthcare field, starting from information extraction from medical documents until the prediction or diagnosis of a disease, machine learning has been involved. Medical imaging is a section that was greatly improved with the integration of machine learning algorithms to the field of computational biology. Nowadays, many disease diagnoses are being performed by medical image processing using machine learning algorithms. In addition, patient care, resource allocation, and research on treatments for various diseases are also being performed using machine learning-based computational decision making. Throughout this paper, various machine learning algorithms and approaches that are being used for decision making in the healthcare sector will be discussed along with the involvement of machine learning in healthcare applications in the current context. With the explored knowledge, it was evident that neural network-based deep learning methods have performed extremely well in the field of computational biology with the support of the high processing power of modern sophisticated computers and are being extensively applied because of their high predicting accuracy and reliability. When giving concern towards the big picture by combining the observations, it is noticeable that computational biology and biomedicine-based decision making in healthcare have now become dependent on machine learning algorithms, and thus they cannot be separated from the field of artificial intelligence.",Journal of Healthcare Engineering,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",946e893f-4e7f-47c5-8544-15aa5a2cc679,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,,2021,N/A,2021,2021-01-27 00:00:00,157,60,"S.

Furthermore, the performance of genetic factors in predicting dyslipidaemia has not been explored. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate prediction models with and without genetic factors for dyslipidaemia in rural populations. Methods A total of 3596 individuals from the Henan Rural Cohort Study were included in this study. According to the ratio of 7:3, all individuals were divided into a training set and a testing set. The conventional models and conventional+GRS (genetic risk score) models were developed with Cox regression, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifiers in the training set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI) were used to assess the discrimination ability of the models, and the calibration curve was used to show calibration ability in the testing set. Results Compared to the lowest quartile of GRS, the hazard ratio ( HR ) (95% confidence interval ( CI )) of individuals in the highest quartile of GRS was 1.23(1.07, 1.41) in the total population. Age, family history of diabetes, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were used to develop the conventional models, and the AUCs of the Cox, ANN, RF, and GBM classifiers were 0.702(0.673, 0.729), 0.736(0.708, 0.762), 0.787 (0.762, 0.811), and 0.816(0.792, 0.839), respectively. After adding GRS, the AUCs increased by 0.005, 0.018, 0.023, and 0.015 with the Cox, ANN, RF, and GBM classifiers, respectively. The corresponding NRI and IDI were 25.6, 7.8, 14.1, and 18.1% and 2.3, 1.0, 2.5, and 1.8%, respectively. Conclusion Genetic factors could improve the predictive ability of the dyslipidaemia risk model, suggesting that genetic information could be provided as a potential predictor to screen for clinical dyslipidaemia. Trial registration The Henan Rural Cohort Study has been registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Register. (Trial registration: ChiCTR-OOC-15006699 .

In this paper, in order to further constrain the mapping problem and reinforce the cycle consistency between two domains, we also introduce a novel regularization method based on the alignment of feature maps probability distributions. This type of optimization constraint, expressed via an additional loss function, allows for further reducing the size of the regions that are mapped from the source domain into the same image in the target domain, which leads to mapping closer to the bijective and thus better performance. By selecting feature maps of the network layers with the same depth d in the encoder of the direct generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the decoder of the inverse GAN, it is possible to describe their d-dimensional probability distributions and, through novel regularization term, enforce similarity between representations of the same image in both domains during the mapping cycle. We introduce several ground distances between Gaussian distributions of the corresponding feature maps used in the regularization. In the experiments conducted on several real datasets, we achieved better performance in the unsupervised image transfer task in comparison to the baseline CycleGAN, and obtained results that were much closer to the fully supervised pix2pix method for all used datasets. The PSNR measure of the proposed method was, on average, 4.7% closer to the results of the pix2pix method in comparison to the baseline CycleGAN over all datasets. This also held for SSIM, where the described percentage was 8.3% on average over all datasets.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-01-10 00:00:00,4,0,"Lidija Krstanović, Branislav M.

Nevertheless, in many real-world applications one of the domains is reduced, i.e., scarce. This means that it has much less training data available in comparison to the other domain, which is fully observable. In order to tackle the problem of using CycleGAN framework in such unfavorable application scenarios, we propose and invoke a novel Bootstrapped SSL CycleGAN architecture (BTS-SSL), where the mentioned problem is overcome using two strategies. Firstly, by using a relatively small percentage of available labelled training data from the reduced or scarce domain and a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach, we prevent overfitting of the discriminator belonging to the reduced domain, which would otherwise occur during initial training iterations due to the small amount of available training data in the scarce domain. Secondly, after initial learning guided by the described SSL strategy, additional bootstrapping (BTS) of the reduced data domain is performed by inserting artifically generated training examples into the training poll of the data discriminator belonging to the scarce domain. Bootstrapped samples are generated by the already trained neural network that performs transferring from the fully observable to the scarce domain. The described procedure is periodically repeated during the training process several times and results in significantly improved performance of the final model in comparison to the original unsupervised CycleGAN approach. The same also holds in comparison to the solutions that are exclusively based either on the described SSL, or on the bootstrapping strategy, i.e., when these are applied separately. Moreover, in the considered scarce scenarios it also shows competitive results in comparison to the fully supervised solution based on the pix2pix method. In that sense, it is directly applicable to many domain transfer tasks that are relying on the CycleGAN architecture.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2022,2022-03-27 00:00:00,3,5,"Lidija Krstanović, Branislav M.

Although building a speaker recognition model on a closed set of speakers under neutral speaking conditions is a well-researched task and there are solutions that provide excellent performance, the classification accuracy of developed models significantly decreases when applying them to emotional speech or in the presence of interference. Furthermore, deep models may require a large number of parameters, so constrained solutions are desirable in order to implement them on edge devices in the Internet of Things systems for real-time detection. The aim of this paper is to propose a simple and constrained convolutional neural network for speaker recognition tasks and to examine its robustness for recognition in emotional speech conditions. We examine three quantization methods for developing a constrained network: floating-point eight format, ternary scalar quantization, and binary scalar quantization. The results are demonstrated on the recently recorded SEAC dataset.",Entropy,journal,['JournalArticle'],8270cfe1-3713-4325-a7bd-c6a87eed889e,Entropy,,24,N/A,2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,16,39,"N.

The method is based on neural network embedding, i.e. mapping of discrete variables into continuous vectors in a low-dimensional space, which has been shown to be a very successful universal deep learning technique. In this particular case, different speaker/style combinations are mapped into different points in a low-dimensional space, which enables the network to capture the similarities and differences between speakers and speaking styles more efficiently. The initial model from which speaker/style adaptation was carried out was a multi-speaker/multi-style model based on 8.5 hours of American English speech data which corresponds to 16 different speaker/style combinations. The results of the experiments show that both versions of the obtained system, one using 10 minutes and the other as little as 30 seconds of target data, outperform the state of the art in parametric speaker/style-dependent speech synthesis. This opens a wide range of application of speaker/style dependent speech synthesis based on small quantities of training data, in domains ranging from customer interaction in call centers to robot-assisted medical therapy.",Journal of universal computer science (Online),Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,J.

Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3D printing community.",J.

Deep learning is springing up in the field of machine learning recently. By mimicking the hierarchical structure of the human brain, deep learning can gradually extract features from lower level to higher level. The Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model is a widely investigated and deployed deep learning architecture. It combines the advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning and can archive good classification performance. This study proposes a classification approach based on the DBN model for detailed urban mapping using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. Through the DBN model, effective contextual mapping features can be automatically extracted from the PolSAR data to improve the classification performance. Two-date high-resolution RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data over the Great Toronto Area were used for evaluation. Comparisons with the support vector machine (SVM), conventional neural networks (NN), and stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) were conducted to assess the potential of the DBN-based classification approach.

In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature that aims to identify the state of the art of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the process of diagnosing and identification of plant pest and diseases. In addition, it presents some issues that are facing the models performance, and also indicates gaps that should be addressed in the future. In this regard, we review studies with various methods that addressed plant disease detection, dataset characteristics, the crops, and pathogens. Moreover, it discusses the commonly employed five-step methodology for plant disease recognition, involving data acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification.

The SDN enables the network operators to manage the overall network consistently and holistically, regardless the complexity of infrastructure devices. The promising features of the SDN enhance network security and facilitate the implementation of threat detection systems through software applications using open APIs. However, the emerging technology creates new security concerns and new threats that do not exist in the current traditional networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) are one of the most rampant attacks that can interrupt the functionality of the network and make most of the network services unreachable for network users. The efficient identification of DDos attacks on SDN environments in literature is still a challenge because of the number of network features taken into account and the overhead of applying machine learning based anomaly detection techniques. Hence, in this paper, we aim to use two popular feature selection methods, i.e., Information Gain (IG) and Random Forest (RF) in order to analyse the most comprehensive relevant features of DDoS attacks in SDN networks. Using the most relevant features will improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection system and reduce the false alarm rates. Moreover, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) technique based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoencoder to tackle the problem of DDoS attacks in SDNs. We perform our analysis and evaluation on three different datasets, i.e., InSDN, CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018. We also measure the overhead of the proposed DL model on the SDN controller and test the network performance in terms of network throughput and end-to-end latency. The results validate that the DL approach can efficiently identify DDoS attacks in SDN environments without any significant degradation in the controller performance.",IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,journal,['JournalArticle'],65e58b80-9699-4da6-bd60-929b57b8533d,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,1862-1880,8,N/A,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,82,71,"Mahmoud Said El Sayed, Nhien-An Le-Khac, Marianne A.

The IoT layer contains various intelligent IoT devices that generate a large number of tasks, each characterized by distinct specifications such as size, computational demand, communication requirements, and latency constraints. owing to the limited storage and computing capacity of resource-constrained IoT devices, it is essential to offload these tasks to different layers to ensure effective processing while satisfying the required Quality of Service (QoS) goals. To address this challenge, a fuzzy logic-based task scheduler is employed to make informed offloading decisions, considering task attributes and determining the most suitable processing layers—whether locally at the IoT layer, on collaborative fog nodes, or in the cloud. Furthermore, the study leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) method, a form of deep reinforcement learning, to identify the optimal fog node for offloading tasks and to maintain a balanced workload distribution across collaborative fog nodes. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of latency, power consumption, network usage, throughput, and offloading rate in comparison with the Non-offload, First-Fit, GASDEO, and NAFITO-FLA methods.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,39936-39952,12,N/A,2024,,14,40,"Dezheen H.

A complete IoT system includes devices, sensors, networks, software, and other essential components necessary for operation and interconnection. However, devices and sensors of this nature often have low resource requirements and multiple security vulnerabilities from manufacturers. Moreover, edge network areas of IoT systems exhibit several security weaknesses. Consequently, unauthorized hijacking of sensors or denial-of-service attacks on edge network areas can have severe consequences for the system’s operation. In this study, we propose a model that combines machine learning algorithms and principal component analysis techniques to train and predict Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Principal component analysis techniques were applied to reduce data dimensionality. We used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score as the evaluation metrics. We explain the True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, and False Negative measures as basic parts of the above evaluation metrics. Unlike previous studies, we used the Training Time to evaluate the training time of each model. We employed two datasets, CICIDS 2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS 2018, to evaluate our proposed model. In general, the proposed models exhibited the best performance and improved training time.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,44319-44334,11,N/A,2023,,5,44,"N.

1fb3c328ee65032b486a3cb3717c5e8d17f0d273,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3251649,A Novel Security Survival Model for Quantum Key Distribution Networks Enabled by Software-Defined Networking,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technique for distributing symmetric encryption keys securely using quantum physics. The rate of key distribution is low and decreases exponentially with increasing distance. A classic trusted relay (CTR) uses additional keys to enhance security distance in QKD networks. In practice, the assurance of security for certain relay nodes is still lacking, despite the fact that CTR requires that all nodes be trusted. Owing to channel unreliability, system faults accumulate during the key relay, thereby increasing the probability of CTR failing to distribute the secret key. The failure of a successful key relay would then result in the subsequent destruction of all the keys involved in the process, which leads to the wasting of the quantum secret key and reduction system encryption. Hence, alleviating the effect of CTR failure for the purpose of obtaining key security distribution of distant quantum network is necessary issue to tackle. Therefore, a new scheme is needed in order to overcome the above-mentioned issues to come up with a better utilization of the generated keys. In this study, a software-defined networking (SDN) technique is introduced to circumvent this drawback by utilising the flexibility provided by the SDN paradigm for better QKD network management. In particular, a novel survivability model called software-defined quantum key relay failure (SDQKRF) is proposed in this paper in which a new function is developed and added to the SDN controller. According to the simulation results, SDN over a QKD network using the SDQKRF model is more reliable and performs better in terms of the key generation ratio, key utilisation rate, recovery after failure, avalanche effect, and service blocking rate than a regular QKD network without the SDQTRF model.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,21641-21654,11,N/A,2023,,17,66,"Omar Shirko, S.

Offloading can be utilized to transfer resource-intensive tasks from resource-limited end devices to a resource-rich fog or cloud layer to reduce end-to-end latency and enhance the performance of the system. However, this advantage is still challenging to achieve in systems with a high request rate because it leads to long queues of tasks in fog nodes and reveals inefficiencies in terms of delays. In this regard, reinforcement learning (RL) is a well-known method for addressing such decision-making issues. However, in large-scale wireless networks, both action and state spaces are complex and extremely extensive. Consequently, reinforcement learning techniques may not be able to identify an efficient strategy within an acceptable time frame. Hence, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed to integrate RL and deep learning (DL) to address this problem. This paper presents a systematic analysis of using RL or DRL algorithms to address offloading-related issues in fog computing. First, the taxonomy of fog computing offloading mechanisms based on RL and DRL algorithms was divided into three major categories: value-based, policy-based, and hybrid-based algorithms. These categories were then compared based on important features, including offloading problem formulation, utilized techniques, performance metrics, evaluation tools, case studies, their strengths and drawbacks, offloading directions, offloading mode, SDN-based architecture, and offloading decisions. Finally, the future research directions and open issues are discussed thoroughly.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,12554-12585,11,N/A,2023,,37,142,"Dezheen H.

2b1c4f516f5b669b16848797f0608d3b76f79ef0,10.3390/s23031392,A Hybrid Generic Framework for Heart Problem Diagnosis Based on a Machine Learning Paradigm,"The early, valid prediction of heart problems would minimize life threats and save lives, while lack of prediction and false diagnosis can be fatal. Addressing a single dataset alone to build a machine learning model for the identification of heart problems is not practical because each country and hospital has its own data schema, structure, and quality. On this basis, a generic framework has been built for heart problem diagnosis. This framework is a hybrid framework that employs multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques and votes for the best outcome based on a novel voting technique with the intention to remove bias from the model. The framework contains two consequent layers. The first layer contains simultaneous machine learning models running over a given dataset. The second layer consolidates the outputs of the first layer and classifies them as a second classification layer based on novel voting techniques. Prior to the classification process, the framework selects the top features using a proposed feature selection framework. It starts by filtering the columns using multiple feature selection methods and considers the top common features selected. Results from the proposed framework, with 95.6% accuracy, show its superiority over the single machine learning model, classical stacking technique, and traditional voting technique. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate how the prediction probabilities of multiple models can be exploited for the purpose of creating another layer for final output; this step neutralizes any model bias. Another experimental contribution is proving the complete pipeline’s ability to be retrained and used for other datasets collected using different measurements and with different distributions.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,20233dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2023,2023-01-26 00:00:00,15,49,"A.

Thus, heart-disease prediction has garnered considerable attention in the medical domain globally. Accordingly, machine-learning algorithms for the early prediction of heart diseases were developed in several studies to help physicians design medical procedures. In this study, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) optimized approach based on random forest (RF), called GAPSO-RF, is developed and used to select the optimal features that can increase the accuracy of heart-disease prediction. The proposed GAPSO-RF implements multivariate statistical analysis in the first step to select the most significant features used in the initial population. After that, a discriminate mutation strategy is implemented in GA. GAPSO-RF combines a modified GA for global search and a PSO for local search. Moreover, PSO achieved the concept of rehabbing individuals that had been refused in the selection process. The performance of the proposed GAPSO-RF approach is validated via evaluation metrics, namely, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by using two datasets from the University of California, namely, Cleveland and Statlog. The experimental results confirm that the GAPSO-RF approach attained the high heart-disease-prediction accuracies of 95.6% and 91.4% on the Cleveland and Statlog datasets, respectively.

In this work, the effects of prickly ash on key taste compounds in stewed sheep tail fat soup were investigated. Results showed that the taste intensity of sheep tail fat soup cooked with 0.2% prickly ash increased significantly. The concentration of organic acids and free amino acids in sheep tail fat soup significantly increased with the addition of prickly ash. The concentration of succinic acid (2.637 to 4.580 mg/g) and Thr (2.558 to 12.466 mg/g) increased the most among organic acids and amino acids, respectively. Spearman’s correlation analysis elucidated that seven taste compounds were positively correlated (correlation coefficient > 0.7) with the overall taste intensity of the soup sample including Thr, Asp, oxalic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, and ascorbic acid.

We tackle the challenge of finding a closed-loop control policy to optimally schedule the operation of a storage device, in order to maximize self-consumption of local photovoltaic production in a microgrid. In this work, the fitted Q-iteration algorithm, a standard batch RL technique, is used by an RL agent to construct a control policy. The proposed method is data-driven and uses a state-action value function to find an optimal scheduling plan for a battery. The battery’s charge and discharge efficiencies, and the nonlinearity in the microgrid due to the inverter’s efficiency are taken into account. The proposed approach has been tested by simulation in a residential setting using data from Belgian residential consumers. The developed framework is benchmarked with a model-based technique, and the simulation results show a performance gap of 19%. The simulation results provide insight for developing optimal policies in more realistically-scaled and interconnected microgrids and for including uncertainties in generation and consumption for which white-box models become inaccurate and/or infeasible.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Energies,1846,10,Unknown,2017,2017-11-12 00:00:00,142,36,"Brida V.

Traditional vapor-compression air conditioners exhibit a lower coefficient of performance (COP) (typically 2.8–3.8) owing to the cooling-based dehumidification methods that handle both sensible and latent loads together. Temperature- and humidity-independent control or desiccant systems have been proposed to overcome these challenges; however, the COP of current desiccant systems is quite small and additional heat sources are usually needed. Here, we report on a desiccant-enhanced, direct expansion heat pump based on a water-sorbing heat exchanger with a desiccant coating that exhibits an ultrahigh COP value of more than 7 without sacrificing any comfort or compactness. The pump’s efficiency is doubled compared to that of pumps currently used in conventional room air conditioners, which is a revolutionary HVAC breakthrough. Our proposed water-sorbing heat exchanger can independently handle sensible and latent loads at the same time. The desiccants adsorb moisture almost isothermally and can be regenerated by condensation heat. This new approach opens up the possibility of achieving ultrahigh efficiency for a broad range of temperature- and humidity-control applications.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,7,N/A,2017,2017-01-12 00:00:00,108,32,"Y.

This paper presents a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) self-tuning temperature sensing and control system for efficiently modulating the temperature environment within a multi-module instrument. The smart system ensures that the internal temperature of the instrument converges to a target without the need of a system model, thus making the control robust. The system consists of a fully-connected proportional–integral–derivative (PID) neural network (FCPIDNN) and an on-line self-tuning module. The experimental results show that the presented system can effectively control the internal temperature under various mission scenarios, in particular, it is able to self-reconfigure upon actuator failure. The system provides a new scheme for a complex and time-variant MIMO control system which can be widely applied for the distributed measurement and control of the environment in instruments, integration electronics, and house constructions.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,16,20163dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2016,2016-10-01 00:00:00,6,20,"Zhen Zhang, Cheng Ma, Rong Zhu","2118029605, 144970602, 2070270377",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9ecf47e17a8d890884c94eae4995db47a83cf06,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2118029605

Four simultaneous reactions are performed in the form of virtual reaction chambers (VRCs) where a ≈200 nL sample is covered with mineral oil and placed on a glass cover slip. Fast, 40 cycle amplification of an amplicon from the H7N9 gene was used to demonstrate the PCR performance. The standard curve slope was -3.02 ± 0.16 cycles at threshold per decade (mean ± standard deviation) corresponding to an amplification efficiency of 0.91 ± 0.05 per cycle (mean ± standard deviation).

Post-industrialized countries are particularly prone to an ever-increasing number of ageing individuals and ageing-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with volume loss in the affected brain. MRI diagnoses and monitoring of subtle volume changes in the ageing/diseased brains have the potential to become standard diagnostic tools. Even with the superior resolution of 7 T MRI scanners, the microstructural changes comprising cell types, cell numbers, and cellular processes, are still undetectable. Knowledge of origin, nature, and progression for microstructural changes are necessary to understand pathogenetic stages in the relentless neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to develop therapeutic tools that delay or stop neurodegenerative processes at their earliest stage. We illustrate the gap in resolution by comparing the identical regions of the post-mortem in situ 7 T MR images (virtual autopsy or virtopsy) with the histological observations in serial sections through the same brain. We also described the protocols and limitations associated with these comparisons, as well as the necessity of supercomputers and data management for “Big data”. Analysis of neuron and/or glial number by using a body of mathematical tools and guidelines (stereology) is time-consuming, cumbersome, and still restricted to trained human investigators. Development of tools based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) could considerably accelerate studies on localization, onset, and progression of neuron loss. Finally, these observations could disentangle the mechanisms of volume loss into stages of reversible atrophy and/or irreversible fatal cell death. This AI- and ML-based cooperation between virtopsy and histology could bridge the present gap between virtual reality and neuropathology. It could also culminate in the creation of an imaging-associated comprehensive database. This database would include genetic, clinical, epidemiological, and technical aspects that could help to alleviate or even stop the adverse effects of neurodegenerative diseases on affected individuals, their families, and society.",Brain Informatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],b409d450-86da-43c3-b686-a9eb1f61675c,Brain Informatics,,6,N/A,2019,2019-03-07 00:00:00,26,102,"S.

This result indicates the possibility that BERT networks capture structural information about language. In this work, we provide novel support for this claim by performing a series of experiments to unpack the elements of English language structure learned by BERT. Our findings are fourfold. BERT’s phrasal representation captures the phrase-level information in the lower layers. The intermediate layers of BERT compose a rich hierarchy of linguistic information, starting with surface features at the bottom, syntactic features in the middle followed by semantic features at the top. BERT requires deeper layers while tracking subject-verb agreement to handle long-term dependency problem. Finally, the compositional scheme underlying BERT mimics classical, tree-like structures.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",1e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,,3651-3657,,20191e33b3be-b2ab-46e9-96e8-d4eb4bad6e44,2019,2019-07-28 00:00:00,1221,24,"Ganesh Jawahar, Benoît Sagot, Djamé Seddah","145123979, 68990982, 1679170",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/335613303ebc5eac98de757ed02a56377d99e03a,"Computer Science, Linguistics",145123979

Molecular approaches such as reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers highly sensitive and specific means to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, however, despite it being the accepted “gold standard”, molecular platforms often require a tradeoff between speed versus throughput. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)—time of flight (TOF)—mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed as a potential solution for COVID-19 testing and finding a balance between analytical performance, speed, and throughput, without relying on impacted supply chains. Combined with machine learning (ML), this MALDI-TOF-MS approach could overcome logistical barriers encountered by current testing paradigms. We evaluated the analytical performance of an ML-enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS method for screening COVID-19. Residual nasal swab samples from adult volunteers were used for testing and compared against RT-PCR. Two optimized ML models were identified, exhibiting accuracy of 98.3%, positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100%, negative percent agreement (NPA) of 96%, and accuracy of 96.6%, PPA of 98.5%, and NPA of 94% respectively.

Clinical decisions including prescription and timing of antibiotics, ordering of additional diagnostics and level-of-care decisions rely on understanding etiology and implications of a clinical presentation.

The 29-host-mRNA blood-based InSepTM test (Inflammatix, Burlingame, CA, formerly known as HostDxTM Sepsis) combines machine learning algorithms with a rapid point-of-care platform with less than 30 min turnaround time to enable rapid diagnosis of acute infections and sepsis, as well as prediction of disease severity. A scientific advisory panel including emergency medicine, infectious disease, intensive care and clinical pathology physicians discussed technical and clinical requirements in preparation of successful introduction of InSep into the market. Topics included intended use; patient populations of greatest need; patient journey and sample flow in the emergency department (ED) and beyond; clinical and biomarker-based decision algorithms; performance characteristics for clinical utility; assay and instrument requirements; and result readouts. The panel identified clear demand for a solution like InSep, requirements regarding test performance and interpretability, and a need for focused medical education due to the innovative but complex nature of the result readout.

ABSTRACT Highly accurate testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the point of care (POC) is an unmet diagnostic need in emergency care and time-sensitive outpatient care settings. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) technology is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 444 patients with 357 evaluable specimens at five U.S. clinical laboratories were enrolled from 21 September 2020 to 23 October 2020. The overall agreement between the Liat and 68/8800 systems for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics was 98.6% (352/357). Using Liat, positive percent agreement for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (162/162) and the negative percent agreement was 97.4% (190/195). The Liat is an RT-PCR POC test that provides highly accurate SARS-CoV-2 results in 20 min with performance equivalent to that of high-throughput laboratory molecular testing.

However, virological relapse (VR) occurs in most patients. We aimed to analyze soluble immune markers (SIMs) and use machine learning to identify SIM combinations as predictor for early VR after NA discontinuation. A validation cohort was used to verify the predictive power of the SIM combination. In a post hoc analysis of a prospective, multicenter therapeutic vaccination trial (ABX‐203, NCT02249988), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antigen, and 47 SIMs were repeatedly determined before NA was stopped. Forty‐three HBeAg‐negative patients were included. To detect the highest predictive constellation of host and viral markers, a supervised machine learning approach was used. Data were validated in a different cohort of 49 patients treated with entecavir. VR (hepatitis B virus DNA ≥ 2,000 IU/mL) occurred in 27 patients. The predictive value for VR of single SIMs at the time of NA stop was best for interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐17, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5) with a maximum area under the curve of 0.65. Hepatitis B core antigen had a higher predictive power than hepatitis B surface antigen but lower than the SIMs. A supervised machine‐learning algorithm allowed a remarkable improvement of early relapse prediction in patients treated with entecavir. The combination of IL‐2, monokine induced by interferon γ (MIG)/chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 9 (CCL9), RANTES/CCL5, stem cell factor (SCF), and TNF‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand (TRAIL) was reliable in predicting VR (0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.5‐1.0) and showed viable results in the validation cohort (0.63; 0.1‐0.99). Host immune markers such as SIMs appear to be underestimated in guiding treatment cessation in HBeAg‐negative patients.

For retailers and marketing analysts, such methods can support the understanding of customers' attitudes towards brands, especially to handle crises that cause behavioural changes in customers, including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the increasing adoption of black-box machine learning-based techniques, transparency becomes a need for those stakeholders to understand why a given sentiment is predicted, which is rarely explored for retailers facing social media crises. This study develops an Explainable Sentiment Analysis (XSA) application for Twitter data, and proposes research propositions focused on evaluating such application in a hypothetical crisis management scenario. Particularly, we evaluate, through discussions and a simulated user experiment, the XSA support for understanding customer's needs, as well as if marketing analysts would trust such an application for their decision-making processes. Results illustrate the XSA application can be effective in providing the most important words addressing customers sentiment out of individual tweets, as well as the potential to foster analysts' confidence in such support.

They will include vehicles of all kinds, medical and industrial robots, agricultural and manufacturing facilities, traffic management systems, and much more. While many organizations strive to develop the next generation of trustworthy, cost-effective autonomous systems, a major gap exists between the challenges in developing these and the state of the art. There is a crucial need for a common scientific and engineering foundation for developing these systems, which we term “autonomics.” We believe that such a foundation will dramatically accelerate the deployment and acceptance of high-quality autonomous systems, for the benefit of human society. The potential benefits of autonomous systems are obvious. However, there are still major issues to be dealt with before developing such systems becomes a commonplace engineering practice, with accepted and trustworthy deliverables. We argue that a solid, evolving, publicly available, community-controlled foundation for developing next-generation autonomous systems is a must, and term the desired foundation “autonomics.” We focus on three main challenges: 1) how to specify autonomous system behavior in the face of unpredictability; 2) how to carry out faithful analysis of system behavior with respect to rich environments that include humans, physical artifacts, and other systems; and 3) how to build such systems by combining executable modeling techniques from software engineering with artificial intelligence and machine learning.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,journal,['JournalArticle'],bb95bf2e-8383-4748-bf9d-d6906d091085,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,17491 - 17498,117,N/A,2019,2019-11-17 00:00:00,48,46,"D.

GTB models have been shown to be implementable in FPGA if the memory requirement fits the available resources. We propose two optimization scenarios for the best possible positioning performance: One restricting the available memory to enable a future FPGA implementation and one without any restrictions. The positioning performance of the GTB models is compared with a DOI estimation method based on a single DOI observable (SO) comparable to other methods presented in literature.

6236a56c9ffaa3f96c17b90e3f93cf1604db8aec,10.1002/mp.12906,"An edge‐readout, multilayer detector for positron emission tomography","Purpose We present a novel gamma‐ray‐detector design based on total internal reflection (TIR) of scintillation photons within a crystal that addresses many limitations of traditional PET detectors. Our approach has appealing features, including submillimeter lateral resolution, DOI positioning from layer thickness, and excellent energy resolution. The design places light sensors on the edges of a stack of scintillator slabs separated by small air gaps and exploits the phenomenon that more than 80% of scintillation light emitted during a gamma‐ray event reaches the edges of a thin crystal with polished faces due to TIR. Gamma‐ray stopping power is achieved by stacking multiple layers, and DOI is determined by which layer the gamma ray interacts in. Method The concept of edge readouts of a thin slab was verified by Monte Carlo simulation of scintillation light transport. An LYSO crystal of dimensions 50.8 mm × 50.8 mm × 3.0 mm was modeled with five rectangular SiPMs placed along each edge face. The mean‐detector‐response functions (MDRFs) were calculated by simulating signals from 511 keV gamma‐ray interactions in a grid of locations. Simulations were carried out to study the influence of choice of scintillator material and dimensions, gamma‐ray photon energies, introduction of laser or mechanically induced optical barriers (LIOBs, MIOBs), and refractive indices of optical‐coupling media and SiPM windows. We also analyzed timing performance including influence of gamma‐ray interaction position and presence of optical barriers. We also modeled and built a prototype detector, a 27.4 mm × 27.4 mm × 3.0 mm CsI(Tl) crystal with 4 SiPMs per edge to experimentally validate the results predicted by the simulations. The prototype detector used CsI(Tl) crystals from Proteus outfitted with 16 Hamamatsu model S13360‐6050PE MPPCs read out by an AiT‐16‐channel readout. The MDRFs were measured by scanning the detector with a collimated beam of 662‐keV photons from a 137Cs source. The spatial resolution was experimentally determined by imaging a tungsten slit that created a beam of 0.44 mm (FWHM) width normal to the detector surface. The energy resolution was evaluated by analyzing list‐mode data from flood illumination by the 137Cs source. Result We find that in a block‐detector‐sized LYSO layer read out by five SiPMs per edge, illuminated by 511‐keV photons, the average resolution is 1.49 mm (FWHM). With the introduction of optical barriers, average spatial resolution improves to 0.56 mm (FWHM). The DOI resolution is the layer thickness of 3.0 mm. We also find that optical‐coupling media and SiPM‐window materials have an impact on spatial resolution. The timing simulation with LYSO crystal yields a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of 200–400 ps, which is slightly position dependent. And the introduction of optical barriers has minimum influence. The prototype CsI(Tl) detector, with a smaller area and fewer SiPMs, was measured to have central‐area spatial resolutions of 0.70 and 0.39 mm without and with optical barriers, respectively. These results match well with our simulations. An energy resolution of 6.4% was achieved at 662 keV. Conclusion A detector design based on a stack of monolithic scintillator layers that uses edge readouts offers several advantages over current block detectors for PET. For example, there is no tradeoff between spatial resolution and detection sensitivity since no reflector material displaces scintillator crystal, and submillimeter resolution can be achieved. DOI information is readily available, and excellent timing and energy resolutions are possible.",Medical Physics (Lancaster),journal,['JournalArticle'],4e90b61b-3ae1-4b4c-9348-d67a3825e703,Medical Physics,2425 - 2438,45,N/A,2018,2018-05-06 00:00:00,26,34,"Xin Li, Maria Ruiz-Gonzalez, L.

Here we apply machine learning methods of support vector machine and convolutional neural network to train models using element compositions of surface sediments from eight potential source regions, accordingly, to determine the dust sources and contributions by classifying the last glacial loess and present interglacial sediments on the CLP. The trained models succeed in differentiating major secondary sources and quantitatively estimating the contributions of both primary and secondary sources at least during the last glacial‐interglacial cycle. The understanding that a constant dust source despite changing climate conditions agrees with those derived from Sr‐Nd isotopes and U‐Pb age spectra.

 The geochemistry of Cenozoic intracontinental high-Mg andesites (HMAs) in northeast Asia, together with regional geophysical data, offers an opportunity to explore the genetic relationship between the formation of intracontinental HMAs and subduction of the Pacific plate. Compared with primary HMAs in arcs, Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia have lower Mg# [100 × Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)] values (53–56) and CaO contents (5.8–6.6 wt%), higher alkali (Na2O + K2O) contents (5.15–6.45 wt%), and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7056–0.7059; εNd = −4.9 to −3.4; εHf = −4.7 to −2.6) as well as lower Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb = 16.76–19.19; 207Pb/204Pb = 15.42–15.45; 208Pb/204Pb = 36.71–37.11). These Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs are similar to Cenozoic potassic basalts in northeast China with respect to their Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions but have higher SiO2 and Al2O3 contents and lower K2O, MgO, and light rare earth element contents. These features indicate that these Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs originated from the mantle, where recycled ancient sediments and water contributed to partial melting of peridotite. Combined with the presence of a large low-resistivity anomaly derived from the mantle transition zone (MTZ) near these intracontinental HMAs, and their occurrence above the stagnant slab front within the MTZ (at 600 km depth) in northeast Asia, we conclude that the stagnant slab front, with high contents of recycled ancient sediments and water, has controlled the formation of Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia.",Geology,journal,,c152ea18-c087-4170-bce5-8c752e71e7c8,Geology,,,N/A,2020,2020-08-07 00:00:00,28,43,"Wenliang Xu, Jia-hui Chen, A.

A rigorous approach to observational studies involves collecting data from different sensors to comprehensively capture the situation of the subject. However, this leads to technical difficulties especially if the sensors are from different manufacturers, as multiple data collection tools have to run simultaneously. We present SensorHub, a system that can collect data from various wearable devices from different manufacturers, such as inertial measurement units, portable electrocardiographs, portable electroencephalographs, portable photoplethysmographs, and sensors for electrodermal activity. Additionally, our tool offers the possibility to include ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in studies. Hence, SensorHub enables multimodal sensor data collection under real-world conditions and allows direct user feedback to be collected through questionnaires, enabling studies at home. In a first study with 11 participants, we successfully used SensorHub to record multiple signals with different devices and collected additional information with the help of EMAs. In addition, we evaluated SensorHub’s technical capabilities in several trials with up to 21 participants recording simultaneously using multiple sensors with sampling frequencies as high as 1000 Hz. We could show that although there is a theoretical limitation to the transmissible data rate, in practice this limitation is not an issue and data loss is rare. We conclude that with modern communication protocols and with the increasingly powerful smartphones and wearables, a system like our SensorHub establishes an interoperability framework to adequately combine consumer-grade sensing hardware which enables observational studies in real life.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,9,25,"Jonas Chromik, Kristina Kirsten, Arne Herdick, A.

In particular, physiological signals are widely used to detect and classify affective states in lab conditions. However, physiological reactions to emotional stimuli have been found to differ in laboratory and natural settings. Thanks to recent technological progress (e.g., in wearables) the creation of EMSR systems for a large number of consumers during their everyday activities is increasingly possible. Therefore, datasets created in the wild are needed to insure the validity and the exploitability of EMSR models for real-life applications. In this paper, we initially present common techniques used in laboratory settings to induce emotions for the purpose of physiological dataset creation. Next, advantages and challenges of data collection in the wild are discussed. To assess the applicability of existing datasets to real-life applications, we propose a set of categories to guide and compare at a glance different methodologies used by researchers to collect such data. For this purpose, we also introduce a visual tool called Graphical Assessment of Real-life Application-Focused Emotional Dataset (GARAFED). In the last part of the paper, we apply the proposed tool to compare existing physiological datasets for EMSR in the wild and to show possible improvements and future directions of research. We wish for this paper and GARAFED to be used as guidelines for researchers and developers who aim at collecting affect-related data for real-life EMSR-based applications.",Frontiers in Psychology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06,Frontiers in Psychology,,11,N/A,2020,2020-07-15 00:00:00,83,180,"Fanny Larradet, Radoslaw Niewiadomski, G.

Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.",BMC Genomics,journal,['JournalArticle'],8dcbaea5-3cdb-48b3-9f93-45c12ca1bb91,BMC Genomics,,21,N/A,2020,2020-01-02 00:00:00,3677,116,"D.

However, other types of data to which these models can be applied have not yet been explored as thoroughly. Labelling is an indispensable stage of data pre-processing that can be particularly challenging, especially when applied to single or multi-model real-time sensor data collection approaches. Currently, real-time sensor data labelling is an unwieldy process, with a limited range of tools available and poor performance characteristics, which can lead to the performance of the machine learning models being compromised. In this paper, we introduce new techniques for labelling at the point of collection coupled with a pilot study and a systematic performance comparison of two popular types of deep neural networks running on five custom built devices and a comparative mobile app (68.5–89% accuracy within-device GRU model, 92.8% highest LSTM model accuracy).

However, GPS does not work indoors due to a lack of direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) satellite signals received from the End Device (ED) due to thick solid materials blocking the ultra-high frequency signals. Furthermore, fingerprint localization using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values is typical for localization in indoor environments. Therefore, this paper develops a low-power intelligent localization system for indoor environments using Long-Range Wide-Area Networks (LoRaWAN) RSSI values with Random Neural Networks (RNN). The proposed localization system demonstrates 98.5% improvement in average localization error compared to related studies with a minimum average localization error of 0.12 m in the Line-of-Sight (LOS). The obtained results confirm LoRaWAN-RNN-based localization systems suitable for indoor environments in LOS applied in big sports halls, hospital wards, shopping malls, airports, and many more with the highest accuracy of 99.52%. Furthermore, a minimum average localization error of 13.94 m was obtained in the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenario, and this result is appropriate for the management and control of vehicles in indoor car parks, industries, or any other fleet in a pre-defined area in the NLOS with the highest accuracy of 44.24%.",Inf.,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Inf.,303,13,Unknown,2022,2022-06-16 00:00:00,14,23,"Winfred Ingabire, H.

In this paper, we present printed sensor antennas for the [862–928] MHz band supporting LoRa and Sigfox and the [2.4–2.5] GHz band for WiFi, Bluetooth, and IEEE802.15.4 communication. To integrate them into smart suitcases, the antennas are printed, overmolded, tested, and measured, following a dedicated conformal integration strategy consisting of two design iterations. Additionally, as a more convenient connection to the printed antennas, printed transmission lines along with a dedicated transition to printed circuit board technologies are implemented and characterized, avoiding rigid coaxial connectors that exhibit fragile mounting on flexible substrates. The overmolded stand-alone antennas achieve fractional impedance bandwidths of 26% and 15% covering the [862–928] MHz and [2.4–2.5] GHz bands, respectively, with a substantial margin and with in-band simulated total efficiencies of 94% and 88%, respectively.

Our method combines a unique problem representation and an unbiased optimization protocol to learn from mirBase19.0 an accurate predictive model, termed MiRduplexSVM. This is the first model that provides precise information about all four ends of the miRNA duplex. We show that (a) our method outperforms four state-of-the-art tools, namely MaturePred, MiRPara, MatureBayes, MiRdup as well as a Simple Geometric Locator when applied on the same training datasets employed for each tool and evaluated on a common blind test set. (b) In all comparisons, MiRduplexSVM shows superior performance, achieving up to a 60% increase in prediction accuracy for mammalian hairpins and can generalize very well on plant hairpins, without any special optimization. (c) The tool has a number of important applications such as the ability to accurately predict the miRNA or the miRNA*, given the opposite strand of a duplex. Its performance on this task is superior to the 2nts overhang rule commonly used in computational studies and similar to that of a comparative genomic approach, without the need for prior knowledge or the complexity of performing multiple alignments. Finally, it is able to evaluate novel, potential miRNAs found either computationally or experimentally.

These molecules silence their target genes by degrading transcription or suppressing translation. Studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in biological responses to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Identification of these molecules and their targets can aid the understanding of regulatory processes. Recently, prediction methods based on machine learning have been widely used for miRNA prediction. However, most of these methods were designed for mammalian miRNA prediction, and few are available for predicting miRNAs in the pre-miRNAs of specific plant species. Although the complete Solanum lycopersicum genome has been published, only 77 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs have been identified, far less than the estimated number. Therefore, it is essential to develop a prediction method based on machine learning to identify new plant miRNAs. A novel classification model based on a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to identify real and pseudo plant pre-miRNAs together with their miRNAs. An initial set of 152 novel features related to sequential structures was used to train the model. By applying feature selection, we obtained the best subset of 47 features for use with the Back Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (B-SVM-RFE) method for the classification of plant pre-miRNAs. Using this method, 63 features were obtained for plant miRNA classification. We then developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, which comprises MiPlantPre and MiPlantMat, to identify plant pre-miRNAs and their miRNAs. This model achieved approximately 90% accuracy using plant datasets from nine plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens, Medicago truncatula, Sorghum bicolor, Arabidopsis lyrata, Zea mays and Solanum lycopersicum. Using miPlantPreMat, 522 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs were identified in the Solanum lycopersicum genome sequence. We developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, based on structure-sequence features and SVM. MiPlantPreMat was used to identify both plant pre-miRNAs and the corresponding mature miRNAs. An improved feature selection method was proposed, resulting in high classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,,15,N/A,2014,2014-12-01 00:00:00,33,41,"Jun Meng, Dong Liu, Chao Sun, Yushi Luan","145365756, 2152508812, 2118133697, 144233098",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/363c760e9905ce5ebeb3bc2de5521cce24d2739b,"Biology, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Medicine",145365756

Most computational tools labeled as miRNA predictors are in fact pre-miRNA predictors and provide no information about the putative miRNA location within the pre-miRNA. Sequence and structural features that determine the location of the miRNA, and the extent to which these properties vary from species to species, are poorly understood. We have developed miRdup, a computational predictor for the identification of the most likely miRNA location within a given pre-miRNA or the validation of a candidate miRNA. MiRdup is based on a random forest classifier trained with experimentally validated miRNAs from miRbase, with features that characterize the miRNA–miRNA* duplex. Because we observed that miRNAs have sequence and structural properties that differ between species, mostly in terms of duplex stability, we trained various clade-specific miRdup models and obtained increased accuracy. MiRdup self-trains on the most recent version of miRbase and is easy to use. Combined with existing pre-miRNA predictors, it will be valuable for both de novo mapping of miRNAs and filtering of large sets of candidate miRNAs obtained from transcriptome sequencing projects.

0689184d274c4106fffc90be0bae58c530607a0b,10.1093/nar/gkt426,CoRAL: predicting non-coding RNAs from small RNA-sequencing data,"The surprising observation that virtually the entire human genome is transcribed means we know little about the function of many emerging classes of RNAs, except their astounding diversities. Traditional RNA function prediction methods rely on sequence or alignment information, which are limited in their abilities to classify the various collections of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). To address this, we developed Classification of RNAs by Analysis of Length (CoRAL), a machine learning-based approach for classification of RNA molecules. CoRAL uses biologically interpretable features including fragment length and cleavage specificity to distinguish between different ncRNA populations. We evaluated CoRAL using genome-wide small RNA sequencing data sets from four human tissue types and were able to classify six different types of RNAs with ∼80% cross-validation accuracy. Analysis by CoRAL revealed that microRNAs, small nucleolar and transposon-derived RNAs are highly discernible and consistent across all human tissue types assessed, whereas long intergenic ncRNAs, small cytoplasmic RNAs and small nuclear RNAs show less consistent patterns. The ability to reliably annotate loci across tissue types demonstrates the potential of CoRAL to characterize ncRNAs using small RNA sequencing data in less well-characterized organisms.",Nucleic Acids Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],da96c220-cd39-4894-bae6-d2d77c8e7aa9,Nucleic Acids Research,e137 - e137,41,N/A,2013,2013-05-21 00:00:00,28,31,"Y.

The sequence of a mature microRNA, especially the ‘seeding sequence’, largely determines its binding ability and specificity to target mRNAs. Therefore, methods that predict mature microRNA sequences with high accuracy will benefit the identification and characterization of novel microRNAs and their targets, and contribute to inferring the post-transcriptional regulation network at a genome scale. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed a method, MiRmat, to predict the mature microRNA sequence. MiRmat is essentially composed of two parts: the prediction of Drosha processing site and the identification of Dicer processing site. Based on the analysis of microRNAs from 12 species, we found that the patterns of free energy profiles are conserved among vertebrate microRNA hairpins. Therefore, we introduced in our method the free energy distribution pattern of the downstream part of pri-microRNA secondary structure and Random Forest algorithm to predict the mature microRNA sequence. Based on the evaluation on an independent test dataset from 10 vertebrates, MiRmat was shown to identify 77.8% of the Drosha processing sites and 92.8% of the Dicer sites within a deviation of 2 nt. In a more stringent evaluation by excluding the microRNAs sharing the same family between the training set and test set, MiRmat kept a rather well performance of 71.9% and 87.2% of the identification rate on the Drosha and Dicer site respectively, which represents the ability to deal with the novel microRNA family. MiRmat outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has a high degree of efficacy for the prediction of mature microRNA sequences of vertebrates. Conclusion MiRmat was developed for identifying microRNA mature sequence(s) by introducing the free energy distribution of RNA stem-loop structure and the Random Forest algorithm. We prove that MiRmat has better performance than the existing tools and is applicable among vertebrates.

The canonical microRNA pathway starts with transcription from DNA and is followed by processing via the microprocessor complex, yielding a hairpin structure. Which is then exported into the cytosol where it is processed by Dicer and then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex. All of these biogenesis steps add to the overall specificity of miRNA production and effect. Unfortunately, their modes of action are just beginning to be elucidated and therefore computational prediction algorithms cannot model the process but are usually forced to employ machine learning approaches. This work focuses on ab initio prediction methods throughout; and therefore homology-based miRNA detection methods are not discussed.

Less is known about the presence of messenger RNA (mRNA). This report profiles the human circulating mRNA transcriptome in people with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to determine whether mRNA analytes can be used as biomarkers of liver disease. Using RNAseq and RT-qPCR, we investigate circulating mRNA in plasma from HCC and LC patients and demonstrate detection of transcripts representing more than 19,000 different protein coding genes. Remarkably, the circulating mRNA expression levels were similar from person to person over the 21 individuals whose samples were analyzed by RNAseq. Liver derived circulating transcripts such as albumin (ALB), apolipoprotein (APO) A1, A2 & H, serpin A1 & E1, ferritin light chain (FTL) and fibrinogen like 1 (FGL1) were significantly upregulated in HCC patient samples. Higher levels of some of these liver-specific transcripts in the plasma of HCC patients were confirmed by RT-qPCR in another cohort of 20 individuals. Several less abundant circulating transcripts associated with cancer were detected in most HCC samples, but not in healthy subjects. Liver specificity of circulating transcripts was confirmed by investigating their expression in HCC tumor and liver cancer cell lines. Liver specific mRNA sequences in the plasma were predominantly present outside circulating extracellular vesicles. Conclusions: The circulating “mRNA” transcriptome is remarkably consistent in diversity and expression from person to person. Detection of transcripts corresponding to disease selective polypeptides suggests the possibility that circulating mRNA can work as a biomarker analyte for cancer detection.",OncoTarget,journal,['JournalArticle'],106ecc86-1801-4b36-a05c-d36db69a968c,Oncotarget,2216 - 2232,11,N/A,2020,2020-06-09 00:00:00,15,53,"A.

Many targets of PARP-1/2-dependent PARylation are involved in the DNA damage response and hence, the loss of these proteins disrupts a wide range of biological processes, from DNA repair and epigenetics to telomere and centromere regulation. The central role of these PARPs in DNA metabolism in cancer cells has led to the development of PARP inhibitors as new cancer therapeutics, both as adjuvant treatment potentiating chemo-, radio-, and immuno-therapies and as monotherapy exploiting cancer-specific defects in DNA repair. However, a cancer is not just made up of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment also includes multiple other cell types, particularly stromal and immune cells. Interactions between these cells—cancerous and non-cancerous—are known to either favor or limit tumorigenesis. In recent years, an important role of PARP-1 and PARP-2 has been demonstrated in different aspects of the immune response, modulating both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is now emerging that PARP-1 and PARP-2 may not only impact cancer cell biology, but also modulate the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the immunomodulatory roles of PARP-1 and PARP-2 may provide invaluable clues to the rational development of more selective PARP-centered therapies which target both the cancer and its microenvironment.",Cancers,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,12,N/A,2020,2020-02-01 00:00:00,56,104,"J.

Complex interactions between tumor cells, lymphocytes and the tumor environment determine the efficacy of such immunotherapies. Innate immune mechanisms – known drivers of liver disease progression in pre-HCC conditions such as fibrosis or cirrhosis – may either support or counteract tumor-related immune activation.

However, the popular tumor marker, AFP, lacks sensitivity although its specificity is high. Tissue biopsy is an invasive operation and may increase the risk of needle-track metastases. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. This study aims to determine whether levels of plasma HSP90α in HCC patients can be used as a cost-effective and simple test for the initial diagnosis of the disease. Plasma samples were collected from 659 HCC patients, 114 secondary hepatic carcinoma (SHC) patients, 28 hepatic hemangioma patients and 230 healthy donors. The levels of HSP90α were measured by ELISA. The levels of plasma HSP90α in HCC patients were significantly higher than in healthy donors and in patients with hepatic hemangioma or SHC (144.08 ± 4.98, 46.81 ± 1.11, 61.56 ± 8.20 and 111.96 ± 10.08 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.05 in all cases). The levels were associated with age (p = 0.001), BCLC stage (p < 0.001), levels of AFP (p < 0.001), tumor size (p < 0.001), tumor number (p < 0.001), PVTT (p < 0.001), EHM (p < 0.001) and Child-Pugh stage in the HCC cohort. In addition, the levels of plasma HSP90α showed an upward trend along with the progression of the BCLC stage. ROC curve analysis showed that compared to AFP (AUC 0.922, 95%CI 0.902–0.938) or HSP90α (AUC 0.836, 95%CI 0.810–0.860), the combination of HSP90α and AFP (AUC0.943, 95%CI 0.925–0.957) significantly improved the diagnostic efficiency for HCC patients.

The use of non-verbal cues such as gestures, body movement, and facial expressions convey the feeling and the feedback to the user. This discipline of Human–Computer Interaction places reliance on the algorithmic robustness and the sensitivity of the sensor to ameliorate the recognition. Sensors play a significant role in accurate detection by providing a very high-quality input, hence increasing the efficiency and the reliability of the system. Automatic recognition of human emotions would help in teaching social intelligence in the machines. This paper presents a brief study of the various approaches and the techniques of emotion recognition. The survey covers a succinct review of the databases that are considered as data sets for algorithms detecting the emotions by facial expressions. Later, mixed reality device Microsoft HoloLens (MHL) is introduced for observing emotion recognition in Augmented Reality (AR). A brief introduction of its sensors, their application in emotion recognition and some preliminary results of emotion recognition using MHL are presented. The paper then concludes by comparing results of emotion recognition by the MHL and a regular webcam.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2018,2018-02-01 00:00:00,134,73,"Dhwani Mehta, M.

Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG “combo” pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting “clean” PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment. The proposed system has been validated and the results confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2018,2018-01-30 00:00:00,125,42,"F.

To date, SPMS studies reported have required many sensors mounted on the backrest plate and seat plate of a chair. The present study, therefore, developed a system that measures a total of six sitting postures including the posture that applied a load to the backrest plate, with four load cells mounted only on the seat plate. Various machine learning algorithms were applied to the body weight ratio measured by the developed SPMS to identify the method that most accurately classified the actual sitting posture of the seated person. After classifying the sitting postures using several classifiers, average and maximum classification rates of 97.20% and 97.94%, respectively, were obtained from nine subjects with a support vector machine using the radial basis function kernel; the results obtained by this classifier showed a statistically significant difference from the results of multiple classifications using other classifiers. The proposed SPMS was able to classify six sitting postures including the posture with loading on the backrest and showed the possibility of classifying the sitting posture even though the number of sensors is reduced.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,18,20183dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2018,2018-01-01 00:00:00,92,27,"Jongryun Roh, Hyeong-jun Park, Kwang-Jin Lee, Joonho Hyeong, Sayup Kim, Boreom Lee","32238848, 8711360, 2145232511, 31899118, 30143656, 3069730",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1594d211739d2222f2c754a5cb93795aefc05586,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",32238848

A large majority of the worldwide population, such as office workers, long journey vehicle drivers and wheelchair users, spends several hours every day in sedentary activities. The postures that sedentary lifestyle users assume during daily activities hide valuable information that can reveal their wellness and general health condition. Aiming at mining such underlying information, we developed a cushion-based system to assess their activity levels and recognize the activity from the information hidden in sitting postures. By placing the smart cushion on the chair, we can monitor users’ postures and body swings, using the sensors deployed in the cushion. Specifically, we construct a body posture analysis model to recognize sitting behaviors. In addition, we provided a smart cushion that effectively combine pressure and inertial sensors. Finally, we propose a method to assess the activity levels based on the evaluation of the activity assessment index (AAI) in time sliding windows. Activity level assessment can be used to provide statistical results in a defined period and deliver recommendation exercise to the users. For practical implications and actual significance of results, we selected wheelchair users among the participants to our experiments. Features in terms of standard deviation and approximate entropy were compared to recognize the activities and activity levels. The results showed that, using the novel designed smart cushion and the standard deviation features, we are able to achieve an accuracy of (>89%) for activity recognition and (>98%) for activity level recognition.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-10-01 00:00:00,35,48,"Congcong Ma, Wenfeng Li, Raffaele Gravina, Jingjing Cao, Qimeng Li, G.

These methods suffer from high computational cost and require stringent labelling and calibration efforts. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight robot navigation framework based purely on uncalibrated spherical images. To simplify the orientation estimation, path prediction and improve computational efficiency, the navigation problem is decomposed into a series of classification tasks. To mitigate the adverse effects of insufficient negative samples in the “navigation via classification” task, we introduce the spherical camera for scene capturing, which enables 360° fisheye panorama as training samples and generation of sufficient positive and negative heading directions. The classification is implemented as an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained on our proposed Spherical-Navi image dataset, whose category labels can be efficiently collected. This CNN is capable of predicting potential path directions with high confidence levels based on a single, uncalibrated spherical image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms competing ones in realistic applications.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-06-01 00:00:00,98,51,"Lingyan Ran, Yanning Zhang, Qilin Zhang, Tao Yang","2769063, 2047640322, 46324995, 87561748",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/731f907d73446eaf15b32d539a31d19fc1349e72,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2769063

With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as deep learning, the feature engineering phase can be completely avoided. Recently reported research studies in this direction show the performance of their algorithms with a biased training data, which limits their practical use in real-time situations. There is a compelling need to mitigate bias and evaluate these methods independently in order to arrive at a new enhanced method for effective zero-day malware detection. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper, first, evaluates the classical MLAs and deep learning architectures for malware detection, classification, and categorization using different public and private datasets. Second, we remove all the dataset bias removed in the experimental analysis by having different splits of the public and private datasets to train and test the model in a disjoint way using different timescales. Third, our major contribution is in proposing a novel image processing technique with optimal parameters for MLAs and deep learning architectures to arrive at an effective zero-day malware detection model. A comprehensive comparative study of our model demonstrates that our proposed deep learning architectures outperform classical MLAs. Our novelty in combining visualization and deep learning architectures for static, dynamic, and image processing-based hybrid approach applied in a big data environment is the first of its kind toward achieving robust intelligent zero-day malware detection. Overall, this paper paves way for an effective visual detection of malware using a scalable and hybrid deep learning framework for real-time deployments.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,46717-46738,7,N/A,2019,2019-04-03 00:00:00,369,46,"R.

Based on these three data sets, three detection models for Android malware detection regarding API calls, API frequency, and API sequence aspects are constructed. Ultimately, an ensemble model is constructed for conformity. We tested and compared the accuracy and stability of our detection models through a large number of experiments. The experiments were conducted on 10010 benign applications and 10683 malicious applications.

It plays an important role in many natural language processing applications such as text summarization, question answering, machine translation, information retrieval, dialog systems, plagiarism detection, and query ranking. STS has been widely studied in the general English domain. However, there exists few resources for STS tasks in the clinical domain and in languages other than English, such as Japanese. Objective The objective of this study is to capture semantic similarity between Japanese clinical texts (Japanese clinical STS) by creating a Japanese dataset that is publicly available. Materials We created two datasets for Japanese clinical STS: (1) Japanese case reports (CR dataset) and (2) Japanese electronic medical records (EMR dataset). The CR dataset was created from publicly available case reports extracted from the CiNii database. The EMR dataset was created from Japanese electronic medical records. Methods We used an approach based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to capture the semantic similarity between the clinical domain texts. BERT is a popular approach for transfer learning and has been proven to be effective in achieving high accuracy for small datasets. We implemented two Japanese pretrained BERT models: a general Japanese BERT and a clinical Japanese BERT. The general Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese Wikipedia texts while the clinical Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese clinical texts. Results The BERT models performed well in capturing semantic similarity in our datasets. The general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT and achieved a high correlation with human score (0.904 in the CR dataset and 0.875 in the EMR dataset). It was unexpected that the general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT on clinical domain dataset. This could be due to the fact that the general Japanese BERT is pretrained on a wide range of texts compared with the clinical Japanese BERT.",Methods of Information in Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],95f5bdab-1f05-4090-899f-3869a15b5707,Methods of Information in Medicine,e56 - e64,60,N/A,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,24,28,"Faith W.

To evaluate our models, we also introduce ARLUE, a new benchmark for multi-dialectal Arabic language understanding evaluation. ARLUE is built using 42 datasets targeting six different task clusters, allowing us to offer a series of standardized experiments under rich conditions. When fine-tuned on ARLUE, our models collectively achieve new state-of-the-art results across the majority of tasks (37 out of 48 classification tasks, on the 42 datasets). Our best model acquires the highest ARLUE score (77.40) across all six task clusters, outperforming all other models including XLM-R Large ( 3.4x larger size).

Many shared tasks and corpora for STS have been organized and curated in the general English domain; however, such resources are limited in the biomedical domain. In 2019, the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) challenge developed a comprehensive clinical STS dataset and organized a community effort to solicit state-of-the-art solutions for clinical STS. Objective This study presents our transformer-based clinical STS models developed during this challenge as well as new models we explored after the challenge. This project is part of the 2019 n2c2/Open Health NLP shared task on clinical STS. Methods In this study, we explored 3 transformer-based models for clinical STS: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, and Robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa). We examined transformer models pretrained using both general English text and clinical text. We also explored using a general English STS dataset as a supplementary corpus in addition to the clinical training set developed in this challenge. Furthermore, we investigated various ensemble methods to combine different transformer models. Results Our best submission based on the XLNet model achieved the third-best performance (Pearson correlation of 0.8864) in this challenge. After the challenge, we further explored other transformer models and improved the performance to 0.9065 using a RoBERTa model, which outperformed the best-performing system developed in this challenge (Pearson correlation of 0.9010).

We apply multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a combination of motor and sensory tests. Results are two-fold. First, multimodal LNM reveals that the functional modality contributes more than the structural one in the prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, when looking at each modality individually, the performance of the structural networks strongly depended on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, thereby eliminating the effect that larger lesions generally produce more severe sensorimotor impairment. In contrast, functional networks provided similar performance regardless of whether or not the effect of lesion size was removed. Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of network modalities, and their corresponding influence on behavioral performance after brain injury.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,N/A,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,4,93,"A.

Brain network disruptions caused by stroke are potential biological determinants of PSD but their conclusive roles are unavailable. Our study aimed to identify the strategic structural disconnection (SDC) pattern for PSD at three months poststroke and assess the predictive value of SDC information. Our prospective cohort of 697 first-ever acute ischemic stroke patients were recruited from three hospitals in central China. Sociodemographic, clinical, psychological and neuroimaging data were collected at baseline and depression status was assessed at three months poststroke. Voxel-based disconnection-symptom mapping found that SDCs involving bilateral temporal white matter and posterior corpus callosum, as well as white matter next to bilateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, were associated with PSD. This PSD-specific SDC pattern was used to derive SDC scores for all participants. SDC score was an independent predictor of PSD after adjusting for all imaging and clinical-sociodemographic-psychological covariates (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07, 1.48; P  = 0.006). Split-half replication showed the stability and generalizability of above results. When added to the clinical-sociodemographic-psychological prediction model, SDC score significantly improved the model performance and ranked the highest in terms of predictor importance. In conclusion, a strategic SDC pattern involving multiple lobes bilaterally is identified for PSD at 3 months poststroke. The SDC score is an independent predictor of PSD and may improve the predictive performance of the clinical-sociodemographic-psychological prediction model, providing new evidence for the brain-behavior mechanism and biopsychosocial theory of PSD.",Translational Psychiatry,journal,['JournalArticle'],18232e92-ef10-46fd-ad77-bb418dcd525d,Translational Psychiatry,,12,N/A,2022,2022-11-03 00:00:00,14,55,"Chensheng Pan, Guo Li, Ping Jing, Guo-Chong Chen, Wenzhe Sun, Jinfeng Miao, Yanyan Wang, Yan Lan, Xiuli Qiu, Xin Zhao, Junhua Mei, Shanshan Huang, L.

We here assessed the contribution of ipsilesional and contralesional anterior intraparietal cortex (aIPS) for hand motor function in 18 recovered chronic stroke patients and 18 healthy control subjects using a multimodal assessment consisting of resting-state functional MRI, motor task functional MRI, online-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) interference, and 3D movement kinematics. Effects were compared against two control stimulation sites, i.e. contralesional M1 and a sham stimulation condition. We found that patients with good motor outcome compared to patients with more substantial residual deficits featured increased resting-state connectivity between ipsilesional aIPS and contralesional aIPS as well as between ipsilesional aIPS and dorsal premotor cortex. Moreover, interhemispheric connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional M1 as well as ipsilesional aIPS and contralesional M1 correlated with better motor performance across tasks. TMS interference at individual aIPS and M1 coordinates led to differential effects depending on the motor task that was tested, i.e. index finger-tapping, rapid pointing movements, or a reach-grasp-lift task. Interfering with contralesional aIPS deteriorated the accuracy of grasping, especially in patients featuring higher connectivity between ipsi- and contralesional aIPS. In contrast, interference with the contralesional M1 led to impaired grasping speed in patients featuring higher connectivity between bilateral M1. These findings suggest differential roles of contralesional M1 and aIPS for distinct aspects of recovered hand motor function, depending on the reorganization of interhemispheric connectivity.",Brain : a journal of neurology,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Brain,1006 - 1020,146,Unknown,2022,2022-04-29 00:00:00,24,98,"L.

This is achieved by combining a quadrupole-based transverse phase-space tomography with the adjustable streaking angle of a polarizable X-band transverse deflection structure. We demonstrate with detailed simulations that the method is able to reconstruct various complex phase-space distributions and that the quality of the reconstruction depends on the number of input projections. This method allows for the identification and visualization of previously unnoticed detailed features in the phase-space distribution and can thereby be used as a tool toward improving the performance of particle accelerators or performing more accurate simulation studies.

The technique has been used in the CLARA accelerator test facility at Daresbury Laboratory: results from the machine learning method are compared with those from a conventional tomography algorithm (algebraic reconstruction), applied to the same data. The use of machine learning allows reconstruction of the 4D phase space distribution of the beam to be carried out much more rapidly than using conventional tomography algorithms, and also enables the use of image compression to reduce signiﬁcantly the size of the data sets involved in the analysis. Results from the machine learning technique are at least as good as those from the algebraic reconstruction tomography in characterising the beam behaviour, in terms of the variation of the beam size in response to variation of the quadrupole strengths.",Physical Review Accelerators and Beams,journal,,f0b25a48-865d-41bf-8487-1394ac41a63f,Physical Review Accelerators and Beams,,,N/A,2022,2022-09-02 00:00:00,17,34,"A.

However, for time-varying systems, the predictive capabilities of ML tools degrade if the systems are no longer accurately represented by the data with which the ML models were trained. For complex systems, re-training is only possible if the changes are slow relative to the rate at which large numbers of new input-output training data can be non-invasively recorded. In this work, we present an approach to deep learning for time-varying systems that does not require re-training, but uses instead an adaptive feedback in the architecture of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The feedback is based only on available system output measurements and is applied in the encoded low-dimensional dense layers of the encoder-decoder CNNs. First, we develop an inverse model of a complex accelerator system to map output beam measurements to input beam distributions, while both the accelerator components and the unknown input beam distribution vary rapidly with time. We then demonstrate our method on experimental measurements of the input and output beam distributions of the HiRES ultra-fast electron diffraction (UED) beam line at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and showcase its ability for automatic tracking of the time varying photocathode quantum efficiency map. Our method can be successfully used to aid both physics and ML-based surrogate online models to provide non-invasive beam diagnostics.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,N/A,2021,2021-09-28 00:00:00,39,67,"A.

The manual process of burn diagnosis is time-consuming and complex, even for experienced doctors. Machine learning (ML) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models have emerged as the standard for medical image diagnosis. The ML-based approach typically requires handcrafted features for training, which may result in suboptimal performance. Conversely, DL-based methods automatically extract features, but designing a robust model is challenging. Additionally, shallow DL methods lack long-range feature dependency, decreasing efficiency in various applications. We implemented several deep CNN models, ResNeXt, VGG16, and AlexNet, for human burn diagnosis. The results obtained from these models were found to be less reliable since shallow deep CNN models need improved attention modules to preserve the feature dependencies. Therefore, in the proposed study, the feature map is divided into several categories, and the channel dependencies between any two channel mappings within a given class are highlighted. A spatial attention map is built by considering the links between features and their locations. Our attention-based model BuRnGANeXt50 kernel and convolutional layers are also optimized for human burn diagnosis. The earlier study classified the burn based on depth of graft and non-graft. We first classified the burn based on the degree. Subsequently, it is classified into graft and non-graft. Furthermore, the proposed model performance is evaluated on Burns_BIP_US_database. The sensitivity of the BuRnGANeXt50 is 97.22% and 99.14%, respectively, for classifying burns based on degree and depth. This model may be used for quick screening of burn patients and can be executed in the cloud or on a local machine.

Contributing to this problem are change in burn appearance throughout the first week requiring periodic evaluation until a confident diagnosis can be made. To overcome these issues, we investigated the feasibility of an artificial intelligence algorithm trained with multispectral images of burn injuries to predict burn depth rapidly and accurately, including burns of indeterminate depth. In a feasibility study, 406 multispectral images of burns were collected within 72 hours of injury and then serially for up to 7 days. Simultaneously, the subject’s clinician indicated whether the burn was of indeterminate depth. The final depth of burned regions within images were agreed upon by a panel of burn practitioners using biopsies and 21-day healing assessments as reference standards. We compared three convolutional neural network architectures and an ensemble in their capability to automatically highlight areas of nonhealing burn regions within images. The top algorithm was the ensemble with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 97% positive predictive value (PPV). Its sensitivity and PPV were found to increase in a sigmoid shape during the first week postburn, with the inflection point at day 2.5. Additionally, when burns were labeled as indeterminate, the algorithm’s sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value were: 70%, 100%, 97%, and 100%. These results suggest multispectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence is feasible for detecting nonhealing burn tissue and could play an important role in aiding the earlier diagnosis of indeterminate burns.",Journal of Burn Care & Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],ee38b919-df66-49ac-a082-bdbeaea54293,Journal of Burn Care & Research: Official Publication of the American Burn Association,969 - 981,44,N/A,2023,2023-04-21 00:00:00,5,48,"Jeffrey E.

Automated image-based algorithms could assist in performing wound detection and classification. We aimed to develop two deep-learning algorithms that respectively identify burns, and classify whether they require surgery. An additional aim assessed the performances in different Fitzpatrick skin types. Annotated burn (n = 1105) and background (n = 536) images were collected. Using a commercially available platform for deep learning algorithms, two models were trained and validated on 70% of the images and tested on the remaining 30%. Accuracy was measured for each image using the percentage of wound area correctly identified and F1 scores for the wound identifier; and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity for the wound classifier. The wound identifier algorithm detected an average of 87.2% of the wound areas accurately in the test set. For the wound classifier algorithm, the AUC was 0.885. The wound identifier algorithm was more accurate in patients with darker skin types; the wound classifier was more accurate in patients with lighter skin types. To conclude, image-based algorithms can support the assessment of acute burns with relatively good accuracy although larger and different datasets are needed.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,N/A,2023,2023-01-31 00:00:00,7,57,"C.

However, severe skin burns are highly dynamic and hard to predict. This results in a low accuracy rate of about 60 - 75% in the diagnosis of partial-thickness burns in the acute post-burn period. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has demonstrated a significant potential for non-invasive and timely estimation of the burn severity. Here, we describe a methodology for the measurement and numerical modeling of the dielectric permittivity of the in vivo porcine skin burns. We use the double Debye dielectric relaxation theory to model the permittivity of the burned tissue. We further investigate the origins of dielectric contrast between the burns of various severity, as determined histologically based on the percentage of the burned dermis, using the empirical Debye parameters. We demonstrate that the five parameters of the double Debye model can form an artificial neural network classification algorithm capable of automatic diagnosis of the severity of the burn injuries, and predicting its ultimate wound healing outcome by forecasting its re-epithelialization status in 28 days. Our results demonstrate that the Debye dielectric parameters provide a physics-based approach for the extraction of the biomedical diagnostic markers from the broadband THz pulses. This method can significantly boost dimensionality reduction of THz training data in artificial intelligence models and streamline machine learning algorithms.",Biomedical Optics Express,journal,['JournalArticle'],7e331686-6620-4481-a3d5-5effffe9ab83,Biomedical optics express,"

Applied to public biosignal datasets and a benchmark for change point detection, the proposed approach delivered lucid visual support in interpreting the biosignals with the SSM while performing accurate automatic segmentation of biosignals with the help of the novelty function and associating the segments grounded on their similarity measures with the similarity profiles.

A heterogeneous group of 21 participants performed an incremental cycling ramp to failure with measurements of HRV, before (PRE), during (EX), and after (POST). Results showed excellent correlations between devices for linear indexes with Pearson’s r between 0.98 to 1.0 for meanRR, SDNN, RMSSD, and 0.95 to 0.97 for the non-linear index DFA a1 during PRE, EX, and POST. There was no significant difference in device specific meanRR during PRE and POST. Bland–Altman analysis showed high agreement between devices (PRE and POST: meanRR bias of 0.0 and 0.4 ms, LOA of 1.9 to −1.8 ms and 2.3 to −1.5; EX: meanRR bias of 11.2 to 6.0 ms; LOA of 29.8 to −7.4 ms during low intensity exercise and 8.5 to 3.5 ms during high intensity exercise). The Movesense Medical device can be used in lieu of a reference ECG for the calculation of HRV with the potential to differentiate noise from atrial fibrillation and represents a significant advance in both a HR and HRV recording device in a chest belt form factor for lab-based or remote field-application.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,27,74,"B.

However, the methodology underlying machine learning in spine research is often overlooked as the subject matter is quite novel and may be foreign to practicing spine surgeons. Improper application of machine learning is a significant bioethics challenge, given the potential consequences of over- or underestimating the results of such studies for clinical decision-making processes. Proper peer review of these publications requires a baseline familiarity of the language associated with machine learning, and how it differs from classical statistical analyses. This narrative review first introduces the overall field of machine learning and its role in artificial intelligence, and defines basic terminology. In addition, common modalities for applying machine learning, including classification and regression decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are examined in the context of examples gathered from the spine literature. Lastly, the ethical challenges associated with adapting machine learning for research related to patient care, as well as future perspectives on the potential use of machine learning in spine surgery, are discussed specifically.",Frontiers in Surgery,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",20f49295-6ad9-4d39-ac66-a41cd69f0e19,Frontiers in Surgery,,7,N/A,2020,2020-08-21 00:00:00,68,96,"Michael Chang, J.

Surgical correction has proven to be effective in achieving improvement of spinopelvic parameters as well as improving quality of life (QoL) for these patients. However, given the relatively high complication risk associated with ASD correction, it is of paramount importance to develop robust prognostic tools for predicting risk profile and outcomes. Historically, statistical models such as linear and logistic regression models were used to identify preoperative factors associated with postoperative outcomes. While these tools were useful for looking at simple associations, they represent generalizations across large populations, with little applicability to individual patients. More recently, predictive analytics utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning for comprehensive processing of large amounts of data have become available for surgeons to implement. The use of these computational techniques has given surgeons the ability to leverage far more accurate and individualized predictive tools to better inform individual patients regarding predicted outcomes after ASD correction surgery. Applications range from predicting QoL measures to predicting the risk of major complications, hospital readmission, and reoperation rates. In addition, AI has been used to create a novel classification system for ASD patients, which will help surgeons identify distinct patient subpopulations with unique risk-benefit profiles. Overall, these tools will help surgeons tailor their clinical practice to address patients’ individual needs and create an opportunity for personalized medicine within spine surgery.",Neurospine,journal,['JournalArticle'],b38d49f5-9e0d-4cd6-a080-adda18e0ae37,Neurospine,686 - 694,16,N/A,2019,2019-12-01 00:00:00,43,34,"Rushikesh S.

A central question of GPCR drug discovery is to understand what determines the agonism or antagonism of ligands which bind them. Ligands exert their action via the interactions in the ligand binding pocket. We hypothesised that there is a common set of receptor interactions made by ligands of diverse structures that mediate their action and that among a large dataset of different ligands, the functionally important interactions will be over-represented. We computationally docked ~2700 known β2AR ligands to multiple β2AR structures, generating ca 75,000 docking poses and predicted all atomic interactions between the receptor and the ligand. We used machine learning (ML) techniques to identify specific interactions that correlate with the agonist or antagonist activity of these ligands. The interpretation of ML analysis in human understandable form allowed us to construct an exquisitely detailed structure-activity relationship that identifies small changes to the ligands that invert their activity and thus helps to guide the drug discovery process.

SATs have been found to be closely related to obesity and obesity-induced metabolic disease. Some studies have shown a significant association between subcutaneous fat metabolism and sexes. However, the molecular mechanisms for this association are still unclear. Here, using the pig as a model, we investigated the systematic association between the subcutaneous fat metabolism and sexes, and identified some key sex-specific pathways and genes in the SATs from pigs. Results The results revealed that 134 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in female and male pigs from the obese group. A total of 17 coexpression modules were detected, of which six modules were significantly correlated with the sexes ( P  < 0.01). Among the significant modules, the greenyellow module (cor = 0.68, P  < 9e-06) and green module (cor = 0.49, P  < 0.003) were most significantly positively correlated with the male and female, respectively. Functional analysis showed that one GO term and four KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the greenyellow module while six GO terms and six KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the green module. Furthermore, a total of five and two key sex-specific genes were identified in the two modules, respectively. Two key sex-specific pathways (Ras-MAPK signaling pathway and type I interferon response) play an important role in the SATs of males and females, respectively. Conclusions The present study identified some key sex-specific pathways and genes in the SATs from pigs, which provided some new insights into the molecular mechanism of being involved in fat formation and immunoregulation between pigs of different sexes. These findings may be beneficial to breeding in the pig industry and obesity treatment in medicine.",BMC Genomic Data,journal,['JournalArticle'],33c80549-9468-4595-9a24-b42d4dbf4f42,BMC Genomic Data,,23,N/A,2022,2022-05-10 00:00:00,7,79,"Huiyu Wang, Xiaoyi Wang, Mingli Li, Shuyan Wang, Qiang Chen, Shaoxiong Lu","2108931523, 2155610656, 47629206, 2108710355, 2146379306, 8090588",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fd43f58974c5bba2b4de94280d0694ef53b92364,"Biology, Medicine",2108931523

The variations of the Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene locus are associated with intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the detailed molecular function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis remains obscure. Our study reveals the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and provides new clues for improving the palatability of meat and enhancing the nutritional value of pork for human health. Abstract The intramuscular fat is a major quality trait of meat, affecting sensory attributes such as flavor and texture. Several previous GWAS studies identified Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene as the candidate gene to regulate intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the underlying molecular function of ACSL4 in adipogenesis within pig skeletal muscle is not fully investigated. In this study, we isolated porcine endogenous intramuscular adipocyte progenitors and performed ACSL4 loss- and gain-of-function experiments during adipogenic differentiation. Our data showed that ACSL4 is a positive regulator of adipogenesis in intramuscular fat cells isolated from pigs. More interestingly, the enhanced expression of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipocytes could increase the cellular content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as gamma-L eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The above results not only confirmed the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and meat quality attributes, but also provided new clues for the improvement of the nutritional value of pork for human health.",Animals,,['JournalArticle'],2c30e84c-941b-45b8-b015-9284a1afdb14,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,,12,Unknown,2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,12,36,"H.

Our previous study findings revealed that ACAA1 is closely associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and fatty acid metabolism pathways, which are involved in fat deposition in sheep, leading to our hypothesis that ACAA1 may be involved in fat deposition by regulating lipid metabolism. However, the associated molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, to assess the potential function of ACAA1 in sheep preadipocyte differentiation, we knocked down and overexpressed ACAA1 in sheep preadipocytes and evaluated the pattern of ACAA1 gene expression during preadipocyte differentiation by qRT-PCR. ACAA1 was significantly expressed in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, and then its expression decreased. ACAA1 deficiency increased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content and promoted sheep preadipocyte differentiation, whereas ACAA1 overexpression inhibited adipogenesis and decreased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content. Simultaneously, we demonstrated that ACAA1 deficiency upregulated the expressions of the adipogenic marker genes PPARγ and C/EBPα in sheep preadipocytes, but ACAA1 overexpression inhibited the expressions of these markers, indicating that ACAA1 affects lipid metabolism by regulating adipogenic marker genes. Our results may promote a better understanding of the regulation of adipogenesis by ACAA1.",Frontiers in Genetics,journal,['JournalArticle'],9ec189b3-db0f-41d8-9c82-21ef5fa9b87e,Frontiers in Genetics,,12,N/A,2021,2021-06-21 00:00:00,25,39,"Yanli Wang, Xin Li, Yang Cao, C.

We evaluated the associations between novel biomarkers and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) for predicting clinical HCC outcomes, hub-related genes, pathway regulation, and immune cells infiltration. Bioinformatic analyses based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were performed using online analysis tools. RBP4 expression was low in HCC and was also down-regulated in pan-cancers compared with normal tissues. RBP4 expression was also significantly different based on age (41–60 years old versus 61–80 years old), and low RBP4 expression levels were associated with advanced tumor stages and grades. Higher RBP4 expression was associated with better overall survival time in HCC patients, and we identified a deletion-mutation rate of 1.4% in RBP4. We also identified ten co-expressed genes most related to RBP4 and explored the relationships between six hub genes (APOB, FGA, FGG, SERPINC1, APOA1, and F2) involved in RBP4 regulation. A pathway enrichment analysis for RBP4 indicated complement and coagulation cascades, metabolic pathways, antibiotic biosynthesis pathways, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways, and pyruvate metabolism pathways. These results suggest that RBP4 may be a novel biomarker for HCC prognosis, and an indicator of low immune response to the disease.",Bioscience Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],678ce279-560b-4a6c-af55-ff68d5c2b544,Bioscience Reports,,41,N/A,2021,2021-04-01 00:00:00,17,43,"Mingxing Li, Zhihui Wang, Lixu Zhu, Yifang Shui, Shuijun Zhang, Wenzhi Guo","2112131095, 2108347004, 2280044871, 46841412, 1492026881, 8513790",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed80ac70e664ea683edbca0a30300b8666592a2b,Medicine,2112131095

To this aim, the present study investigated the co-expression networks of genes related to variations in the major fatty acids deposited in pig Semimembranosus muscle. Palmitic and palmitoleic acid contents were associated with a downregulation of genes involved in autophagy, mitochondrial fusion, and mitochondrial activity, suggesting that the deposition of these fatty acids may be enhanced in muscles with a reduced mitochondrial function. A higher proportion of oleic acid and a reduction in the percentages of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were related to changes in the mRNA levels of genes involved in Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling. The obtained results indicated gene expression networks and new candidate genes associated with the studied traits. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and identify in the discussed genes molecular markers for future selection schemes aimed at improving pork nutritional and technological quality. Furthermore, as pigs are considered reliable animal models for several human conditions, the obtained results may also be of interest for improving the knowledge of the molecular pathways associated with obesity and diabetes. Abstract To date, high-throughput technology such as RNA-sequencing has been successfully applied in livestock sciences to investigate molecular networks involved in complex traits, such as meat quality. Pork quality depends on several organoleptic, technological, and nutritional characteristics, and it is also influenced by the fatty acid (FA) composition of intramuscular fat (IMF). To explore the molecular networks associated with different IMF FA compositions, the Semimembranosus muscle (SM) from two groups of Italian Large White (ILW) heavy pigs divergent for SM IMF content was investigated using transcriptome analysis. After alignment and normalization, the obtained gene counts were used to perform the Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA package in R environment). Palmitic and palmitoleic contents showed association with the same gene modules, comprising genes significantly enriched in autophagy, mitochondrial fusion, and mitochondrial activity. Among the key genes related to these FAs, we found TEAD4, a gene regulating mitochondrial activity that seems to be a promising candidate for further studies. On the other hand, the genes comprised in the modules associated with the IMF contents of oleic, n-6, and n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) were significantly enriched in Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling, in agreement with previous studies suggesting that several MAPK players may have a primary role in regulating lipid deposition. These results give an insight into the molecular cascade associated with different IMF FA composition in ILW heavy pigs. Further studies are needed to validate the results and confirm whether some of the identified key genes may be effective candidates for pork quality.",Animals,,['JournalArticle'],2c30e84c-941b-45b8-b015-9284a1afdb14,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,,11,Unknown,2021,2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,80,"M.

In this study, the Longissimus dorsi muscle tissues were collected from five Liaoning cashmere (LC) goats and five Ziwuling black (ZB) goats with phenotypic difference in carcass weight, some meat quality traits and muscle components. The histological quantitative of collagen fibers and the transcriptome profiles in the Longissimus dorsi muscle tissues were investigated using Masson-trichrome staining and RNA-Seq, respectively. The percentage of total collagen fibers in the Longissimus dorsi muscle tissues from ZB goats was less than those from LC goats, suggesting that these ZB goats had more tender meat. An average of 15,919 and 15,582 genes were found to be expressed in Longissimus dorsi muscle tissues from LC and ZB goats, respectively. Compared to LC goats, the expression levels of 78 genes were up-regulated in ZB goats, while 133 genes were down-regulated. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in GO terms related to the muscle growth and development and the deposition of intramuscular fat and lipid metabolism, hippo signaling pathway and Jak-STAT signaling pathway.

The advanced EDL integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms with Capsule Networks (CapsNet) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for more nuanced feature extraction and classification. We introduce a novel ensemble adaptive weighting approach that dynamically adjusts classifier weights based on performance across disease types and severity levels, significantly improving the algorithm's handling of complex and rare cases. To enhance model interpretability, we implement an explainable AI component that provides visual heatmaps of the most significant regions for each diagnosis to clinicians. We evaluate the enhanced EDL on a large, diverse dataset encompassing multiple retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma, across various ethnicities and age groups.

A new approach of Cyber bullying detection and classification network (CBDC- Net) for improving the effectiveness of detection of cyber bullying in OSNs based on natural language processing features, feature selection techniques, and deep learning algorithms is also presented in this study. CBDC-Net can overcome these challenges to existing detection methods of cyber bullying using innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning approaches. In the data preprocessing step, CBDC-Net filter and normalize the text data that is openly collected from OSNs. After that, CBDC-Net extracts features using a Synonym Level N-Gram (SLNG) approach and it incorporates both the word and character-based information to make the synonyms of text much better than the other method. After that, CSI of CBDC-Net applied Textual Similarity Resilient Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (TSR-SCSO) for feature selection to give an iterative value of their features’ importance level to detect cyber bullying.

Video Analytics for human action recognition is given significance due to its utility. However, it is very challenging to analyze live-streaming videos to identify human actions across the frames in the video. The literature showed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among computer vision applications' most popular deep learning algorithms. Another important observation is that Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) architecture with deep learning has the potential to leverage effectiveness in applications using computer vision. Inspired by this finding, we created a GAN-based framework (called HARGAN) in this research for human activity identification from surveillance films. The framework exploits a retrained deep learning model known as ResNet50 and convolutional LSTM for better performance in action recognition. Our framework has two critical functionalities: feature learning and human action recognition. The ResNet50 model achieves the former, while the GAN-based convolutional LSTM model achieves the latter. We proposed an algorithm called the Generative Adversarial Approach for Human Action Recognition (GAA-HAR) to realize the framework. We used a benchmark dataset known as UCF50, which is extensively used in studies on human action identification.

As a result, an improved algorithm for facial identification with and without masks is required. After the Covid-19 breakout, deep learning algorithms were utilized in research to recognize faces wearing masks. Those algorithms, however, were trained on both mask- and mask-free faces.

Most machine detection methods are constrained by congenital observations, although computers have been utilized in several recent research studies to diagnose AD. In AD, the hippocampus is usually the first part of the brain to be affected. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (SMRI) can be used to assist in diagnosing AD by measuring the hippocampus’s form and volume (MRI). The information encoded by these attributes is restricted and may be affected by segmentation problems. These traits are also extracted independently of the classification, which could result in lower-than-desired classification accuracy. Researchers in this study used structural MRI data to develop a deep learning framework for combined automatic hippocampus segmentation and AD categorization. Multi-task deep learning (MTDL) is used to learn hippocampus segmentation simultaneously.

Devices can minimize interference and optimize bandwidth usage by using directional antennas and by avoiding overlapping communication ranges. In addition, devices need to carefully manage their use of resources, such as bandwidth and energy. Bandwidth is limited in wireless personal area networks (WPANs), so devices need to carefully select which data to send and receive. In this paper, an intelligent performance analysis of energy‐efficient resource optimization model has been proposed for device‐to‐device (D2D) communication in fifth‐generation (5G) WPAN. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation in D2D communication is important because it helps reduce energy consumption and extend the lifespan of devices that are communicating with each other. By allocating resources in an efficient manner, communication between two devices can be optimized for maximum efficiency. This helps reduce the amount of energy needed to power the communication, as well as the amount of energy needed to power the device that is communicating with another device. Additionally, efficient resource allocation helps reduce the overall cost of communication, as the use of fewer resources results in a lower overall cost. The proposed efficient resource allocation helps reduce the environmental impact of communication, as less energy is used for communication. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation model (EERAM) has reached 92.97% of energy allocation, 88.72% of power allocation, 87.79% of bandwidth allocation, 87.93% of spectrum allocation, 88.43% of channel allocation, 25.47% of end‐to‐end delay, 94.33% of network data speed, and 90.99% of network throughput.",International Journal of Communication Systems,journal,['JournalArticle'],657efb9d-473f-4e6b-b416-eaa71d96e4dd,International Journal of Communication Systems,,36,N/A,2023,2023-05-22 00:00:00,64,40,"J.

People have been experimenting with techniques to extend their lives since ancient times. Despite this, technology is still a long way from attaining the aim of lowering mortality rates. Methods From methodological perspective, a design Science Research (DSR) approach is adopted in this research. As such, to investigate the current healthcare and interaction systems created for predicting cardiac disease for patients, we first analyzed the body of existing literature. After that, a conceptual framework of the system was designed using the gathered requirements. Based on the conceptual framework, the development of different components of the system was completed. Finally, the evaluation study procedure was developed taking into account the effectiveness, usability and efficiency of the developed system. Results To attain the objectives, we proposed a system consisting of a wearable device and mobile application, which allows the users to know their risk levels of having CVDs in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques were adopted to develop the system that can classify its users into three risk levels (high, moderate and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 80.4% and two risk levels (high and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 91%. The stacking classifier incorporating best-performing ML algorithms was used for predicting the risk levels of the end-users utilizing the UCI Repository dataset. Conclusion The resultant system allows the users to check and monitor their possibility of having CVD in near future using real-time data. Also, the system was evaluated from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) point of view. Thus, the created system offers a promising resolution to the current biomedical sector.

CVDs are accompanied by various complications, including all pathological changes involving the heart and/or blood vessels. The list of pathological changes includes hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction and stroke. Hence, prevention and early diagnosis could limit the onset or progression of the disease. Nowadays, machine learning (ML) techniques have gained a significant role in disease prediction and are an essential tool in medicine. In this study, a supervised ML-based methodology is presented through which we aim to design efficient prediction models for CVD manifestation, highlighting the SMOTE technique’s superiority. Detailed analysis and understanding of risk factors are shown to explore their importance and contribution to CVD prediction. These factors are fed as input features to a plethora of ML models, which are trained and tested to identify the most appropriate for our objective under a binary classification problem with a uniform class probability distribution.

In CVDs, the heart is unable to deliver enough blood to other body regions. As an effective and accurate diagnosis of CVDs is essential for CVD prevention and treatment, machine learning (ML) techniques can be effectively and reliably used to discern patients suffering from a CVD from those who do not suffer from any heart condition. Namely, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) play a key role in the diagnosis of CVDs through predictive models that allow us to identify the main risks factors influencing CVD development. In this study, we analyze the performance of ten MLAs on two datasets for CVD prediction and two for CVD diagnosis. Algorithm performance is analyzed on top-two and top-four dataset attributes/features with respect to five performance metrics –accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and roc-auc—using the train-test split technique and k-fold cross-validation. Our study identifies the top-two and top-four attributes from CVD datasets analyzing the performance of the accuracy metrics to determine that they are the best for predicting and diagnosing CVD. As our main findings, the ten ML classifiers exhibited appropriate diagnosis in classification and predictive performance with accuracy metric with top-two attributes, identifying three main attributes for diagnosis and prediction of a CVD such as arrhythmia and tachycardia; hence, they can be successfully implemented for improving current CVD diagnosis efforts and help patients around the world, especially in regions where medical staff is lacking.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2021,2021-10-09 00:00:00,27,47,"L.

Manual logging of drill holes can be difficult to exploit as the results may not be comparable between holes due to the subjective nature of geological logging. Exploration and mining companies commonly collect geochemical or mineralogical data from diamond drill core or drill chips; however, manual interpretation of multivariate data can be slow and challenging; therefore, automation of any of the steps in the interpretation process would be valuable. Hyperspectral analysis of drill chips provides a relatively inexpensive method of collecting very detailed information rapidly and consistently. However, the challenge of such data is the high dimensionality of the data’s variables in comparison to the number of samples. Hyperspectral data is usually processed to produce mineral abundances generally involving a range of assumptions. This paper presents the results of testing a new fast and objective methodology to identify the lithological boundaries from high dimensional hyperspectral data. This method applies a quadrant scan analysis to recurrence plots. The results, applied to nickel laterite deposits from New Caledonia, demonstrate that this method can identify transitions in the downhole data. These are interpreted as reflecting mineralogical changes that can be used as an aid in geological logging to improve boundary detection.",Minerals,journal,,05479075-64ee-4b95-b9a7-023afff1b556,Minerals,,,N/A,2021,2021-12-29 00:00:00,4,25,"Ayham A.

However, large multi-element data sets are slow and challenging to interpret without using some form of automated analysis, such as mathematical, statistical or machine learning techniques. Automated analysis techniques also have the advantage in that they are repeatable and can provide consistent results, even for very large data sets. In this paper, an automated litho-geochemical interpretation workflow is demonstrated, which includes data exploration and data preparation using appropriate compositional data-analysis techniques. Multiscale analysis using a modified wavelet tessellation has been applied to the data to provide coherent geological domains. Unsupervised machine learning (clustering) has been used to provide a first-pass classification. The results are compared with the detailed geologist’s logs. The comparison shows how the integration of automated analysis of geochemical data can be used to enhance traditional geological logging and demonstrates the identification of new geological units from the automated litho-geochemical logging that were not apparent from visual logging but are geochemically distinct. KEY POINTS To reduce computational complexity and facilitate interpretation, a subset of geochemical elements is selected, and then a centred log-ratio transform is applied. The wavelet tessellation method is used to domain the drill holes into rock units at a range of scales.

High spatial resolution (0.2–1.0 mm/pixel) hyperspectral imagery in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) were acquired on 755 rock samples and 400 m of continuous drill core. Spectral metrics are used to measure the relative abundance of 12 minerals and an additional metric is derived to estimate white mica grain size. In the Valley and Lornex deposits, coarse-grained white mica is associated with mineralization and is detectable up to 4 km away from the deposits. Kaolinite is present within 2 km of the mineralized centers but does not necessarily occur within strongly mineralized intervals. Prehnite is ubiquitous from 4 to 8 km from the deposits. In the Bethlehem deposit, tourmaline and epidote are associated with mineralization.

Automated or semi-automated interpretation of numerical drill hole data is required to reduce time and subjectivity of this process. However, results from machine learning algorithms applied to drill holes, without reference to spatial information, typically result in numerous small-scale units. These small-scale units result not only from the presence of very small rock units, which may be below the scale of interest, but also from misclassification. A novel method is proposed that uses the continuous wavelet transform to identify geological boundaries and uses wavelet coefficients to indicate boundary strength. The wavelet coefficient is a useful measure of boundary strength because it reflects both wavelength and amplitude of features in the signal. This means that boundary strength is an indicator of the apparent thickness of geological units and the amount of change occurring at each geological boundary. For multivariate data, boundaries from multiple variables are combined and multiscale domains are calculated using the combined boundary strengths. The method is demonstrated using multi-element geochemical data from mineral exploration drill holes. The method is fast, reduces misclassification, provides a choice of scales of interpretation and results in hierarchical classification for large scales where domains may contain more than one rock type.",Mathematical Geosciences,journal,,1f92bb34-5c40-4f63-96fd-95b66eafdcb0,Mathematical Geosciences,21-53,53,N/A,2020,2020-03-11 00:00:00,34,42,"E.

This interpretation method uses readily available distributed 3D data at the most relevant scale for mining and exploration. This method does not depend on collecting traditional structural data from core, such as orientation of planar and linear data, but relies on the premise that grade distributions sampled from drilling provide insight into the structural control of the deposit, with the interpretation of structural geometry done using a computer 3D viewer. This method is applied to the well-studied Archean Sigma-Lamaque gold deposit, which features late-orogenic vein mineralization, and which is controlled by three orders of structural features. The first-order control is the easterly plunging pipe-like conduit parallel to F 2 fold plunge defined by the intersection of bedding (S 0 ) and foliation (S 2 ) (~ 1.5 km radius × 3 km down-plunge). The second-order controls, nested within the first-order, are the younger subvertical Late Diorite plugs that intruded vertically into the host rocks along the established S 2 foliation anisotropy (1250:400:150 m dimension for Main Plug). The third-order control, laterally limited by first- and second-order structural controls, is the well-documented gold-bearing vein sets (1–10 m thick and up to 1.5 km in extent) that developed in the Late Diorites and in the older folded volcanogenic stratigraphy and diorites. It is proposed that the first-order control defined by the moderately plunging F 2 fold is the main fluid pathway resulting from structural permeability formed during earlier folding. The second-order Late Diorite plugs and other competent lithological units, which intersected and fractured during late-stage D 2 compression, served as chemically reactive sites causing gold to precipitate along this first-order pathway. It is predicted that intrusions that do not intersect the first-order structural conduits are less likely to be mineralized. Greenfield orogenic-gold exploration requires that the first-order controls are identified, and the geometry of hydrothermal alteration is best understood in the context of the structural architecture of the host rocks.",Mineralium Deposita,journal,,c968effb-ab79-45ac-bf25-9e428a8537ac,Mineralium Deposita,217-240,55,N/A,2020,2020-01-27 00:00:00,24,87,E.

In this paper, a methodology to integrate mineralogical and structural data extracted from hyperspectral drill-core scans is proposed. The workflow allows for the identification of vein types based on minerals having significant absorption features in the short-wave infrared. The method not only targets alteration halos of known compositions but also allows for the identification of any vein-like structure. The results consist of vein distribution maps, quantified vein abundances, and their azimuths. Three drill-cores from the Bolcana porphyry system hosting veins of variable density, composition, orientation, and thickness are analysed for this purpose. The results are validated using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy-based mineral mapping techniques. We demonstrate that the use of hyperspectral scanning allows for faster, non-invasive and more efficient drill-core mapping, providing a useful tool for complementing core-logging performed by on-site geologists.",Minerals,journal,,05479075-64ee-4b95-b9a7-023afff1b556,Minerals,,,N/A,2019,2019-02-19 00:00:00,25,51,"Laura Tusa, L.

One important step in the area of manufacturing is feature recognition that aims to detect all the machining features from a 3-D model. In this research area, recognizing and locating a wide variety of highly intersecting features are extremely challenging as the topology information of features is substantially damaged because of the feature intersection. Motivated by the single shot multibox detector (SSD), this article presents a novel deep learning approach named SsdNet to tackle the machining feature localization and recognition problem. The typical SSD is designed for 2-D image objection detection rather than 3-D feature recognition. Therefore, the network architecture and output of SSD are modified to fulfil the purpose of this research. In addition, some advanced techniques are also utilized to further enhance the recognition performance. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art feature recognition performance (95.20% F-score), localization performance (90.62% F-score), and recognition efficiency (243.85 ms per model).",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],2135230a-3b24-4b71-9583-60624389377a,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,3292-3302,17,N/A,2021,2021-05-01 00:00:00,26,37,"Peizhi Shi, Q.

In general, traditional rule-based feature recognition methods are computationally expensive, and dependent on surface or feature types. In addition, it is quite challenging to design proper rules to recognise intersecting features. Recently, a learning-based method, named FeatureNet, has been proposed for both single and multi-feature recognition. This is a general purpose algorithm which is capable of dealing with any type of features and surfaces. However, thousands of annotated training samples for each feature are required for training to achieve a high single feature recognition accuracy, which makes this technique difficult to use in practice. In addition, experimental results suggest that multi-feature recognition part in this approach works very well on intersecting features with small overlapping areas, but may fail when recognising highly intersecting features. To address the above issues, a deep learning framework based on multiple sectional view (MSV) representation named MsvNet is proposed for feature recognition. In the MsvNet, MSVs of a 3D model are collected as the input of the deep network, and the information achieved from different views are combined via the neural network for recognition. In addition to MSV representation, some advanced learning strategies (e.g. transfer learning, data augmentation) are also employed to minimise the number of training samples and training time. For multi-feature recognition, a novel view-based feature segmentation and recognition algorithm is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve the state-of-the-art single feature performance on the FeatureNet dataset with only a very small number of training samples (e.g. 8–32 samples for each feature), and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based multi-feature recognition method in terms of recognition performances.",Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,journal,['JournalArticle'],9c5296b3-9225-4538-9b2d-f8f178534aad,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,1291 - 1309,31,N/A,2020,2020-01-22 00:00:00,67,74,"Peizhi Shi, Q.

This region experiences groundwater ecosystem degradation as a result of the rapid conversion of rural agricultural land to urban areas under chronic drought conditions. This study aims to enhance Groundwater Pollution Risk (GwPR) mapping by integrating the DRASTIC index with machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), alongside hydrogeochemical investigations, to promote sustainable water management in Kerman Province. The RF model achieved the highest accuracy with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.995 in predicting GwPR, outperforming BRT (0.988), SVM (0.977), MARS (0.951), and GLM (0.887). The RF-based map identified new high-vulnerability zones in the northeast and northwest and showed an expanded moderate vulnerability zone, covering 48.46% of the study area. Analysis revealed exceedances of WHO standards for total hardness (TH), sodium, sulfates, chlorides, and electrical conductivity (EC) in these high-vulnerability areas, indicating contamination from mineralized aquifers and unsustainable agricultural practices. The findings underscore the RF model’s effectiveness in groundwater prediction and highlight the need for stricter monitoring and management, including regulating groundwater extraction and improving water use efficiency in riverine aquifers.",Water,journal,['JournalArticle'],2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2024,2024-09-27 00:00:00,10,70,"Mortaza Tavakoli, Zeynab Karimzadeh Motlagh, M.

Recent literature highlights the increasing attention towards WQI based on water pollution index (WPI) and GWQI as essential tools for simplifying complex hydrogeological data, thereby facilitating effective groundwater management and protection. Unlike previous works, the present research introduces a novel hybrid method that integrates non-parametric kernel Gaussian learning (GPR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and decision tree (DT) algorithms. This approach marks the first application of a non-parametric kernel for groundwater quality pollution index prediction in Saudi Arabia, offering a significant advancement in the field. Through laboratory analysis and the combination of various machine learning (ML) techniques, this study enhances prediction capabilities, particularly for unmonitored sites in arid and semi-arid regions. The study’s objectives include feature engineering based on dependency sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential variables affecting WQI and GWQI, and the development of predictive models using ANFIS, GPR, and DT for both indices. Furthermore, it aims to assess the impact of different data portions on WQI and GWQI predictions, exploring data divisions such as (70% / 30%), (60% / 40%), and (80% / 20%) for training and testing phase, respectively. By filling a critical gap in water resource management, this research offers significant implications for the prediction of water quality in regions facing similar environmental challenges. Through its innovative methodology and comprehensive analysis, this study contributes to the broader effort of managing and protecting water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. The result proved that GPR-M1 exhibited exceptional testing phase accuracy with RMSE = 0.0169 for GWQI. Similarly, for WPI, the ANFIS-M1 achieved high testing predictive skills with RMSE = 0.0401. The results emphasize the critical role of data quality and quantity in training for enhancing model robustness and prediction precision in water quality assessment.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,14,N/A,2024,2024-08-28 00:00:00,10,44,"Abdulhayat M.

The study focused on examining three types of water-cement ratio (W/C) conditions, with a constant addition of cement-based binder (C). Due to the soft clay nature of the Saga Lowland, frequent ground settlement and deformation occur, necessitating measures to prevent adverse effects on the surrounding environment. The objective of this research is to provide a valuable approach to optimizing the quality of the improved columns while minimizing ground displacement in an environmentally considerate manner. In Saga Lowland, it is common to fix the W/C ratio at 1.0 and vary the cement content. Through experimental construction for improved columns on the field, the study confirmed that W/C values of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 influence the quality of the improved structure. A higher W/C value of 1.5 resulted in a more fluid cement slurry due to a higher injection rate (IR = 23.9%), as evidenced by statistical analysis revealing higher average unconfined compressive strength ( $$\overline{{q }_{u}}$$
 
 
 q

 ¯
 
 ), and a lower coefficient of variation (CV). The defective rate of 10% (qudr) from the design standard strength shows that values are lowest for Case 2, followed by Case 3 and then Case 1. Comparing the values of Case 2 and Case 3, it is observed that in Case 3, with a higher W/C, the CV is lower.. Regarding horizontal ground displacement (Sh), Case 3 exhibited a Sh value of 2.0 to 6.5 mm, significantly lower than Saga prefecture standards (20 mm). This outcome is attributed to reduced viscosity during mixing, leading to improved fluidity and minimal lateral displacement of the soil–cement columns (which often results in lateral ground uplift). Even though with a higher W/C = 1.5, the implementation cost remains the same, but the constructed structure would be of higher quality and smaller displacement, with the overall structure corresponding to the standard quality. The study includes the specific geotechnical conditions of the Saga Lowland and the scope of experimentation. Nonetheless, in terms of the applicability and optimization of DMM in Saga Lowland, the findings provide practical guidance for engineers in selecting W/C ratio and IR during construction for future DMM implementations, thereby contributing to the development of long-lasting infrastructure and sustainable societal development.",Smart Construction and Sustainable Cities,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Smart Construction and Sustainable Cities,,,Unknown,2024,2024-04-02 00:00:00,6,10,"Hirofumi Usui, D.

Initially, the method addresses the challenge of background noise and interference in vibration signals by identifying a fault-sensitive frequency band (FSFB). From the FSFB, raw hybrid statistical features are extracted in time, frequency, and time–frequency domains, forming a comprehensive feature pool. Recognizing that not all features adequately represent MCP conditions and can reduce classification accuracy, we propose a novel ER-LDA method. ER-LDA evaluates feature importance by calculating the explanatory ratio between interclass distance and intraclass scatteredness, facilitating the selection of discriminative features through LDA. This fusion of ER-based feature assessment and LDA yields the novel ER-LDA technique. The resulting selective feature set is then passed into a k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithm for condition classification, distinguishing between normal, mechanical seal hole, mechanical seal scratch, and impeller defect states of the MCP. The proposed technique surpasses current cutting-edge techniques in fault classification.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,24,20243dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2024,2024-03-01 00:00:00,7,47,"Saif Ullah, Zahoor Ahmad, Jong-Myon Kim","2291588438, 1961263837, 2157125336",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/854ca1a2cb529e27e7a0430f2265edfd3748aa87,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2291588438

Language identification (“LI”) is the problem of determining the natural language that a document or part thereof is written in. Automatic LI has been extensively researched for over fifty years. Today, LI is a key part of many text processing pipelines, as text processing techniques generally assume that the language of the input text is known. Research in this area has recently been especially active. This article provides a brief history of LI research, and an extensive survey of the features and methods used in the LI literature. We describe the features and methods using a unified notation, to make the relationships between methods clearer. We discuss evaluation methods, applications of LI, as well as off-the-shelfLI systems that do not require training by the end user. Finally, we identify open issues, survey the work to date on each issue, and propose future directions for research in LI.

A key challenge is the lack of an adequate corpus of messages annotated for language that reflects the linguistic diversity present on Twitter. We overcome this through a “mostly-automated” approach to gathering language-labeled Twitter messages for evaluating language identification. We present the method to construct this dataset, as well as empirical results over existing datasets and off-theshelf language identifiers. We also test techniques that have been proposed in the literature to boost language identification performance over Twitter messages. We find that simple voting over three specific systems consistently outperforms any specific system, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the task.",,Unknown,,Unknown,,17-25,,Unknown,2014,2014-04-01 00:00:00,94,41,"Marco Lui, Timothy Baldwin","5571580, 145465286",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2d0dd2202e514a60c671eee8abea81544c18285,"Computer Science, Linguistics",5571580

Each type of bark made by dogs has a distinct context. The classification of dog bark pattern will aid in the understanding of barking action. In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used to analyze the pattern of barking from two different dog species: Rajapalayam Hound and Kombai Hound. The objective is to find the context of the dog barking pattern based on various real-time scenarios, including whether the dogs are alone, looking at strangers, or showing an eagerness to fight. The barks of the dogs were recorded inside the house under different scenarios, such as while identifying the owner or strangers. Machine learning algorithms, such as the reinforcement learning method, were used in predicting and classifying the dog sounds. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning that will generate the next best action for the given state. It is a model-free learning used to find the best course of dog action for the given current state of the dog. The Q-learning algorithm had been used in improving the prediction of dog sounds by updating the values of learning, where the values with the highest reward were taken into consideration. In total, 6171 barks were collected from the dogs chosen for study, and the proposed approach achieved a correct prediction accuracy of 85.19% of the dog sounds.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2022,2022-10-21 00:00:00,2,40,"Prabu Mohandas, Jerline Sheebha Anni, K.

In this work, we propose a deep-learning-assisted implementation incorporating a wearable device, a base station, a mobile application, and a cloud-based infrastructure that can first monitor in real-time the activity, the audio signals, and the location of a SaR dog, and second, recognize and alert the rescuing team whenever the SaR dog spots a victim. For this purpose, we employed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) both for the activity recognition and the sound classification, which are trained using data from inertial sensors, such as 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope and from the wearable’s microphone, respectively. The developed deep learning models were deployed on the wearable device, while the overall proposed implementation was validated in two discrete search and rescue scenarios, managing to successfully spot the victim (i.e., obtained F1-score more than 99%) and inform the rescue team in real-time for both scenarios.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-01-27 00:00:00,25,52,"P.

With many independent teams working in different research areas, shared standards become an essential safeguard to ensure compliance with state-of-the-art methods allowing appropriate comparison of results across studies and potential integration and combination of extraction and recognition systems. In this paper we propose a basic standard acoustic parameter set for various areas of automatic voice analysis, such as paralinguistic or clinical speech analysis. In contrast to a large brute-force parameter set, we present a minimalistic set of voice parameters here. These were selected based on a) their potential to index affective physiological changes in voice production, b) their proven value in former studies as well as their automatic extractability, and c) their theoretical significance. The set is intended to provide a common baseline for evaluation of future research and eliminate differences caused by varying parameter sets or even different implementations of the same parameters. Our implementation is publicly available with the openSMILE toolkit. Comparative evaluations of the proposed feature set and large baseline feature sets of INTERSPEECH challenges show a high performance of the proposed set in relation to its size.",IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,journal,['JournalArticle'],a88e2a6c-903f-42e1-8dfc-f2547e32020a,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,190-202,7,N/A,2016,2016-04-01 00:00:00,1432,73,"F.

Despite this, it has been suggested that during domestication dogs have become socially more tolerant and attentive than wolves. These two characteristics are crucial for cooperation, and it has been argued that these changes allowed dogs to successfully live and work with humans. However, these domestication hypotheses have been put forward mainly based on dog-wolf differences reported in regard to their interactions with humans. Thus, it is possible that these differences reflect only an improved capability of dogs to accept humans as social partners instead of an increase of their general tolerance, attentiveness and cooperativeness. At the Wolf Science Center, in order to detangle these two explanations, we raise and keep dogs and wolves similarly socializing them with conspecifics and humans and then test them in interactions not just with humans but also conspecifics. When investigating attentiveness toward human and conspecific partners using different paradigms, we found that the wolves were at least as attentive as the dogs to their social partners and their actions. Based on these findings and the social ecology of wolves, we propose the Canine Cooperation Hypothesis suggesting that wolves are characterized with high social attentiveness and tolerance and are highly cooperative. This is in contrast with the implications of most domestication hypotheses about wolves. We argue, however, that these characteristics of wolves likely provided a good basis for the evolution of dog-human cooperation.",Frontiers in Psychology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06,Frontiers in Psychology,,5,N/A,2015,2015-01-15 00:00:00,110,109,"F.

The use of NIR spectra, therefore, requires a preprocessing step. This article reviews the main preprocessing methods in the light of aquaphotomics. Simple methods for visualizing the spectra are proposed in order to guide the user in the choice of the best preprocessing. The most common chemometrics preprocessing are presented and illustrated by three real datasets. Some preprocessing aims to produce a spectrum as close as possible to the absorbance that would have been measured under ideal conditions and is very useful for the establishment of an aquagram. Others, dedicated to the improvement of the resolution of the spectra, are very useful for the identification of the peaks. Finally, special attention is given to the problem of reducing multiplicative effects and to the potential pitfalls of some very popular methods in chemometrics.

cb004c1bd6796118879563b226def1973c41531c,10.3322/caac.21763,"Cancer statistics, 2023","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus‐associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.",Ca,journal,['JournalArticle'],7777b179-7a66-44e1-bcc7-b454f2057262,CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians,17 - 48,73,N/A,2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,9936,124,"R.

Here, we describe the technical details of the implementation of fluorescence lifetime and diffuse reflectance measurements by the system, equipped with an original needle optical probe, compatible with the 17.5G biopsy needle standard. The fluorescence lifetime measurements observed by the setup were verified in fresh solutions of NADH and FAD++, and then applied in a murine model for the characterisation of inoculated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent liver tissue. The technique, applied in vivo and in situ and supplemented by measurements of blood oxygen saturation, made it possible to reveal statistically significant transformation in the set of measured parameters linked with the cellular pools of NADH and NADPH. In the animal model, we demonstrate that the characteristic changes in registered fluorescent parameters can be used to reliably distinguish the HCC tissue, liver tissue in the control, and the metabolically changed liver tissues of animals with the developed HCC tumour. For further transition to clinical applications, the optical biopsy system was tested during the routing procedure of the PNB in humans with suspected HCC. The comparison of the data from murine and human HCC tissues suggests that the tested animal model is generally representative in the sense of the registered fluorescence lifetime parameters, while statistically significant differences between their absolute values can still be observed.",Biomedical Optics Express,journal,['JournalArticle'],7e331686-6620-4481-a3d5-5effffe9ab83,Biomedical optics express,"

Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to assess the diagnostic volume and to trace the sensing depth. Fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements were used to monitor metabolic and morphological changes in tissues. The tissue oxygen saturation was evaluated using a recently developed approach to neural network fitting of diffuse reflectance spectra. The Support Vector Machine Classification was applied to identify intact liver and tumor tissues.

Turn measures and activity rates were quantified. Fall incidence within 12 months from continuous monitoring defined fall status, with 7/153 prospective fallers/non-fallers. Based on the analysis of 718,582 turns, prospective fallers turned less frequently, took longer to turn, and were less consistent in turn angle (p = 0.007, 0.025, and 0.038, respectively). Prospective fallers also walked slower and spent less time walking and turning and more time engaged in sedentary behavior (p = 0.043, 0.012, and 0.015, respectively). Individuals experiencing decline in the control of gait and/or turning may attempt to reduce their risk of falling by limiting their exposure and implementing cautionary movement strategies while turning. Since there was no difference in the overall active rate between prospective fallers and non-fallers, impaired gait and turning ability, specifically, may attribute to elevated fall risk within this cohort.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,8,N/A,2018,2018-03-12 00:00:00,65,48,"Julia M.

ff15e5a042c5a987b20c13377894762e70f48175,10.1002/asi.24493,Lexical data augmentation for sentiment analysis,"Machine learning methods, especially deep learning models, have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks including sentiment analysis. However, deep learning models are more demanding for training data. Data augmentation techniques are widely used to generate new instances based on modifications to existing data or relying on external knowledge bases to address annotated data scarcity, which hinders the full potential of machine learning techniques. This paper presents our work using part‐of‐speech (POS) focused lexical substitution for data augmentation (PLSDA) to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms in sentiment analysis. We exploit POS information to identify words to be replaced and investigate different augmentation strategies to find semantically related substitutions when generating new instances. The choice of POS tags as well as a variety of strategies such as semantic‐based substitution methods and sampling methods are discussed in detail. Performance evaluation focuses on the comparison between PLSDA and two previous lexical substitution‐based data augmentation methods, one of which is thesaurus‐based, and the other is lexicon manipulation based. Our approach is tested on five English sentiment analysis benchmarks: SST‐2, MR, IMDB, Twitter, and AirRecord. Hyperparameters such as the candidate similarity threshold and number of newly generated instances are optimized. Results show that six classifiers (SVM, LSTM, BiLSTM‐AT, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers [BERT], XLNet, and RoBERTa) trained with PLSDA achieve accuracy improvement of more than 0.6% comparing to two previous lexical substitution methods averaged on five benchmarks. Introducing POS constraint and well‐designed augmentation strategies can improve the reliability of lexical data augmentation methods. Consequently, PLSDA significantly improves the performance of sentiment analysis algorithms.",J. Assoc. Inf. Sci.

In NLP similar results are reported most commonly for low data regimes, non-pretrained models, or situationally for pretrained models. In this paper we ask how effective these techniques really are when applied to pretrained transformers. Using two popular varieties of task-agnostic data augmentation (not tailored to any particular task), Easy Data Augmentation (Wei andZou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrichet al., 2015), we conduct a systematic examination of their effects across 5 classification tasks, 6 datasets, and 3 variants of modern pretrained transformers, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. We observe a negative result, finding that techniques which previously reported strong improvements for non-pretrained models fail to consistently improve performance for pretrained transformers, even when training data is limited. We hope this empirical analysis helps inform practitioners where data augmentation techniques may confer improvements.",Findings,journal,['JournalArticle'],479d5605-51be-4346-b1d6-4334084504df,,4401-4411,,N/A,2020,2020-10-05 00:00:00,80,35,"S.

7fe54fcdd2d720d04588fee3645f4399dcab0226,10.3390/s17112557,Super-Resolution of Plant Disease Images for the Acceleration of Image-based Phenotyping and Vigor Diagnosis in Agriculture,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) are a very promising branch of technology, and they have been utilized in agriculture—in cooperation with image processing technologies—for phenotyping and vigor diagnosis. One of the problems in the utilization of UAVs for agricultural purposes is the limitation in flight time. It is necessary to fly at a high altitude to capture the maximum number of plants in the limited time available, but this reduces the spatial resolution of the captured images. In this study, we applied a super-resolution method to the low-resolution images of tomato diseases to recover detailed appearances, such as lesions on plant organs. We also conducted disease classification using high-resolution, low-resolution, and super-resolution images to evaluate the effectiveness of super-resolution methods in disease classification. Our results indicated that the super-resolution method outperformed conventional image scaling methods in spatial resolution enhancement of tomato disease images. The results of disease classification showed that the accuracy attained was also better by a large margin with super-resolution images than with low-resolution images. These results indicated that our approach not only recovered the information lost in low-resolution images, but also exerted a beneficial influence on further image analysis. The proposed approach will accelerate image-based phenotyping and vigor diagnosis in the field, because it not only saves time to capture images of a crop in a cultivation field but also secures the accuracy of these images for further analysis.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-11-01 00:00:00,92,34,"Kyosuke Yamamoto, T.

An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-09-01 00:00:00,1081,55,"A.

The automated texture analysis test was applied offline to all images. Their performance to predict the occurrence of sPTB before 37 + 0 and 34 + 0 weeks was evaluated separately and in combination on 633 recruited patients. AUC for sPTB prediction before weeks 37 and 34 respectively were as follows: 55.5% and 65.3% for CL, 63.4% and 66.3% for texture analysis, 67.5% and 76.7% when combined. The new test improved detection rates of CL at similar low FPR. Combining the two increased detection rate compared to CL alone from 13.0 to 30.4% for sPTB < 37 and from 14.3 to 42.9% sPTB < 34. Texture analysis of cervical ultrasound improved sPTB detection rate compared to cervical length for similar FPR, and the two combined together increased significantly prediction performance.

This pathology has been associated with increased fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In standard clinical practice, late IUGR diagnosis can only be suspected in the third trimester and ultimately confirmed at birth. This study presents a radial basis function support vector machine (RBF-SVM) classification based on quantitative features extracted from fetal heart rate (FHR) signals acquired using routine cardiotocography (CTG) in a population of 160 healthy and 102 late IUGR fetuses. First, the individual performance of each time, frequency, and nonlinear feature was tested. To improve the unsatisfactory results of univariate analysis we firstly adopted a Recursive Feature Elimination approach to select the best subset of FHR-based parameters contributing to the discrimination of healthy vs. late IUGR fetuses. A fine tuning of the RBF-SVM model parameters resulted in a satisfactory classification performance in the training set (accuracy 0.93, sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.84). Comparable results were obtained when applying the model on a totally independent testing set. This investigation supports the use of a multivariate approach for the in utero identification of late IUGR condition based on quantitative FHR features encompassing different domains. The proposed model allows describing the relationships among features beyond the traditional linear approaches, thus improving the classification performance. This framework has the potential to be proposed as a screening tool for the identification of late IUGR fetuses.",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,,['JournalArticle'],6a8c0041-d0b7-4e32-b52c-33adef005c7e,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,,4,Unknown,2021,2021-03-08 00:00:00,20,51,"N.

Methods Data came from 3159 obstetric patients and their newborns enrolled in a multi-center retrospective study. Variable importance, the effect of a variable on model performance, was used for identifying major predictors of newborn’s BMI among ultrasound measures and maternal/delivery information. The ultrasound measures included biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) taken three times during the week 21 - week 35 of gestational age and once in the week 36 or later. Results Based on variable importance from the random forest, major predictors of newborn’s BMI were the first AC and EFW in the week 36 or later, gestational age at delivery, the first AC during the week 21 - the week 35, maternal BMI at delivery, maternal weight at delivery and the first BPD in the week 36 or later. For predicting newborn’s BMI, linear regression (2.0744) and the random forest (2.1610) were better than artificial neural networks with one, two and three hidden layers (150.7100, 154.7198 and 152.5843, respectively) in the mean squared error. Conclusions This is the first machine-learning study with 64 clinical and sonographic markers for the prediction of newborns’ BMI.

Methods Images of fetal faces with sonography obtained from outpatient pregnant women with a singleton fetus were enrolled in routine conventional practice from 19 to 38 weeks of gestation from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, with completely de-identified data. The images were classified into seven categories, such as eye blinking, mouthing, face without any expression, scowling, smiling, tongue expulsion, and yawning. The category in which the number of fetuses was less than 10 was eliminated before preparation. Next, we created a deep learning AI classifier with the data. Statistical values such as accuracy for the test dataset and the AI confidence score profiles for each category per image for all data were obtained. Results The number of fetuses/images in the rated categories were 14/147, 23/302, 33/320, 8/55, and 10/72 for eye blinking, mouthing, face without any expression, scowling, and yawning, respectively. The accuracy of the AI fetal facial expression for the entire test data set was 0.985.

However, there is a subset of patients who develop recurrence. In addition to the pathological stage, clinical and therapeutic factors affect the probability of recurrence. Machine learning is a subtype of artificial intelligence that is considered effective for predictive tasks. We tried to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer using machine learning methods based on clinical data. Methods We enrolled 75 patients with early stage endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I or II) who had received surgical treatment at our institute. A total of 5 machine learning classifiers were used, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and boosted tree, to predict the recurrence based on 16 parameters (age, body mass index, gravity/parity, hypertension/diabetic, stage, histological type, grade, surgical content and adjuvant chemotherapy). We analyzed the classification accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC). Results The highest accuracy was 0.82 for SVM, followed by 0.77 for RF, 0.74 for LR, 0.66 for DT, and 0.66 for boosted trees. The highest AUC was 0.53 for LR, followed by 0.52 for boosted trees, 0.48 for DT, and 0.47 for RF. Therefore, the best predictive model for this analysis was LR.

Objectives This work aimed to establish effective models to predict early GDM. Methods Pregnancy data for 73 variables during the first trimester were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Based on a machine learning (ML)-driven feature selection method, 17 variables were selected for early GDM prediction. To facilitate clinical application, 7 variables were selected from the 17-variable panel. Advanced ML approaches were then employed using the 7-variable data set and the 73-variable data set to build models predicting early GDM for different situations, respectively. Results A total of 16 819 and 14 992 cases were included in the training and testing sets, respectively. Using 73 variables, the deep neural network model achieved high discriminative power, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.80. The 7-variable logistic regression (LR) model also achieved effective discriminate power (AUC = 0.77). Low body mass index (BMI) (≤ 17) was related to an increased risk of GDM, compared to a BMI in the range of 17 to 18 (minimum risk interval) (11.8% vs 8.7%, P = .09). Total 3,3,5′-triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxin (T4) were superior to free T3 and free T4 in predicting GDM. Lipoprotein(a) was demonstrated a promising predictive value (AUC = 0.66). Conclusions We employed ML models that achieved high accuracy in predicting GDM in early pregnancy. A clinically cost-effective 7-variable LR model was simultaneously developed.

However, data for these traits are limited to specific field sites. Despite this limitation, field-scale calibrated crop models for high-yielding traits are being applied over large scales using gridded weather and soil datasets. This study investigates the implications of this practice. The SIMPLACE modeling platform was applied using field, 1 km, 25 km, and 50 km input data resolution and sources, with 1881 combinations of three traits [radiation use efficiency (RUE), light extinction coefficient (K), and fruiting efficiency (FE)] for the period 2001–2010 across Germany. Simulations at the grid level were aggregated to the administrative units, enabling the quantification of the aggregation effect. The simulated yield increased by between 1.4 and 3.1 t ha− 1 with a maximum RUE trait value, compared to a control cultivar. No significant yield improvement (< 0.4 t ha− 1) was observed with increases in K and FE alone. Utilizing field-scale input data showed the greatest yield improvement per unit increment in RUE. Resolution of water related inputs (soil characteristics and precipitation) had a notably higher impact on simulated yield than of temperature. However, it did not alter the effects of high-yielding traits on yield. Simulated yields were only slightly affected by data aggregation for the different trait combinations. Warm-dry conditions diminished the benefits of high-yielding traits, suggesting that benefits from high-yielding traits depend on environments. The current findings emphasize the critical role of input data resolution and source in quantifying a large-scale impact of high-yielding traits.

 Wheat's nutritional value is critical for human nutrition and food security. However, more attention is needed, particularly regarding the content and concentration of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), especially in the context of climate change (CC) impacts. To address this, various controlled field experiments were conducted, involving the cultivation of three wheat cultivars over three growing seasons at multiple locations with different soil and climate conditions under varying Fe and Zn treatments. The yield and yield attributes, including nutritional values such as nitrogen (N), Fe and Zn, from these experiments were integrated with national yield statistics from other locations to train and test different machine learning (ML) algorithms. Automated ML leveraging a large number of models, outperformed traditional ML models, enabling the training and testing of numerous models, and achieving robust predictions of grain yield (GY) (R2 > 0.78), N (R2 > 0.75), Fe (R2 > 0.71) and Zn (R2 > 0.71) through a stacked ensemble of all models. The ensemble model predicted GY, N, Fe, and Zn at spatial explicit in the mid-century (2020-2050) using three Global Circulation Models (GCMs): GFDL-ESM4, HadGEM3-GC31-MM, and MRI-ESM2-0 under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) specifically SSP2-45 and SSP5-85, from the downscaled NEX-GDDP-CMIP6. Averaged across different GCMs and SSPs, CC is projected to increase wheat yield by 4.5 %, and protein concentration by 0.8 % with high variability. However, it is expected to decrease Fe concentration by 5.5 %, and Zn concentration by 4.5 % in the mid-century (2020-2050) relative to the historical period (1980-2010). Positive impacts of CC on wheat yield encountered by negative impacts on nutritional concentrations, further exacerbating challenges related to food security and nutrition.",Environmental Research Letters,journal,['JournalArticle'],373ee421-9890-40bc-87d7-59518033a715,Environmental Research Letters,,,N/A,2024,2024-08-30 00:00:00,5,0,"A.

The increasing adoption of MLSs in safety critical domains such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance has fostered much attention towards the quality assurance of such systems. Despite the advances in software testing, MLSs bring novel and unprecedented challenges, since their behaviour is defined jointly by the code that implements them and the data used for training them. To identify the existing solutions for functional testing of MLSs, and classify them from three different perspectives: (1) the context of the problem they address, (2) their features, and (3) their empirical evaluation. To report demographic information about the ongoing research. To identify open challenges for future research. We conducted a systematic mapping study about testing techniques for MLSs driven by 33 research questions. We followed existing guidelines when defining our research protocol so as to increase the repeatability and reliability of our results. We identified 70 relevant primary studies, mostly published in the last years. We identified 11 problems addressed in the literature. We investigated multiple aspects of the testing approaches, such as the used/proposed adequacy criteria, the algorithms for test input generation, and the test oracles.

The accuracy of these calculations depends on the force field quality and on the thoroughness of configuration sampling. Sampling is an obstacle in simulations due to the frequent appearance of kinetic bottlenecks in the free energy landscape. Very often this difficulty is circumvented by enhanced sampling techniques. Typically, these techniques depend on the introduction of appropriate collective variables that are meant to capture the system’s degrees of freedom. In ligand binding, water has long been known to play a key role, but its complex behaviour has proven difficult to fully capture. In this paper we combine machine learning with physical intuition to build a non-local and highly efficient water-describing collective variable. We use it to study a set of host-guest systems from the SAMPL5 challenge. We obtain highly accurate binding free energies and good agreement with experiments. The role of water during the binding process is then analysed in some detail. Computational approaches to predict water’s role in host-ligand binding attract a great deal of attention. Here the authors use a metadynamics enhanced sampling method and machine learning to compute binding energies for host-guest systems from the SAMPL5 challenge and provide details of water structural changes.",Nature Communications,journal,['JournalArticle'],43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,12,N/A,2020,2020-06-23 00:00:00,47,50,"Valerio Rizzi, L.

In particular, the binding free energy of a drug candidate to its biomolecular target is used as an objective quantity in drug design. Recently, binding kinetics—rates of association (kon) and dissociation (koff)—have also demonstrated utility for their ability to predict efficacy and in some cases have been shown to be more predictive than the binding free energy alone. Some methods exist to calculate binding kinetics from molecular simulations, although these are typically more difficult to calculate than the binding affinity as they depend on details of the transition path ensemble. Assessing these rate constants can be difficult, due to uncertainty in the definition of the bound and unbound states, large error bars and the lack of experimental data. As an additional consistency check, rate constants from simulation can be used to calculate free energies (using the log of their ratio) which can then be compared to free energies obtained experimentally or using alchemical free energy perturbation. However, in this calculation it is not straightforward to account for common, practical details such as the finite simulation volume or the particular definition of the “bound” and “unbound” states. Here we derive a set of correction terms that can be applied to calculations of binding free energies using full reactive trajectories. We apply these correction terms to revisit the calculation of binding free energies from rate constants for a host-guest system that was part of a blind prediction challenge, where significant deviations were observed between free energies calculated with rate ratios and those calculated from alchemical perturbation. The correction terms combine to significantly decrease the error with respect to computational benchmarks, from 3.4 to 0.76 kcal/mol. Although these terms were derived with weighted ensemble simulations in mind, some of the correction terms are generally applicable to free energies calculated using physical pathways via methods such as Markov state modeling, metadynamics, milestoning, or umbrella sampling.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],a75714cc-ae87-4828-a0a2-e7f8d57a5632,Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,,7,N/A,2020,2020-06-05 00:00:00,33,73,"Robert Hall, Tom Dixon, Alex Dickson","2069314965, 2067829627, 48487951",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1897d451b669ea9e69484a31a44aa2175cb33449,"Chemistry, Medicine, Physics",2069314965

Thus, the modelling, characterization, classification, diagnosis, and analysis of such mental disorders bears great significance in medical research. Electroencephalogram records provide important information to improve clinical diagnosis and are very useful in the scientific community. In this work, electroencephalogram records and patient data from the Hospital Virgen de la Luz in Cuenca (Spain) were processed for a correct classification of bipolar disorders. This work implemented an innovative radial basis function-based neural network employing a fuzzy means algorithm. The results show that the proposed method is an effective approach for discrimination of two kinds of classes, i.e., bipolar disorder patients and healthy persons. The proposed algorithm achieved the best performance compared with other machine learning techniques such as Bayesian linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian naive Bayes, decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, or support vector machine, showing a very high accuracy close to 97%. Therefore, the neural network technique presented could be used as a new tool for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, considering the possibility of integrating this method into medical software.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2022,2022-01-23 00:00:00,9,62,"M.

Currently, several approaches classified as electrical, magnetic, neuroimaging recordings and brain stimulations are available to obtain neural activity of the human brain. Among them, non-invasive methods like electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly employed, as they can provide a high degree of temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds) and acceptable space resolution. In addition, it is simple, quick, and does not create any physical harm or stress to patients. Concerning signal processing, once the neural signals are acquired, different procedures can be applied for feature extraction. In particular, brain signals are normally processed in time, frequency, and/or space domains. The features extracted are then used for signal classification depending on its characteristics such us the mean, variance or band power. The role of machine learning in this regard has become of key importance during the last years due to its high capacity to analyze complex amounts of data. The algorithms employed are generally classified in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement techniques. A deep review of the most used machine learning algorithms and the advantages/drawbacks of most used methods is presented. Finally, a study of these procedures utilized in a very specific and novel research field of electroencephalography, i.e., autobiographical memory deficits in schizophrenia, is outlined.",Electronics,journal,['Review'],ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2021,2021-12-05 00:00:00,32,47,"M.

Given that anxiety disorders are one of the most common comorbidities in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), this population is particularly vulnerable to mental stress, severely limiting overall quality of life. To prevent this, early stress quantification with machine learning (ML) and effective anxiety mitigation with non-pharmacological interventions are essential. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of exploiting electroencephalography (EEG) signals for stress assessment by comparing several ML classifiers, namely support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning methods. We trained a total of eleven subject-dependent models-four with conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) methods and seven with deep learning approaches-on the EEG of neurotypical ( n =5) and ASD ( n =8) participants performing alternating blocks of mental arithmetic stress induction, guided and unguided breathing. Our results show that a multiclass two-layer LSTM RNN deep learning classifier is capable of identifying mental stress from ongoing EEG with an overall accuracy of 93.27%.

In the era of digital medicine and precision therapeutics, new personalized treatment approaches are warranted for depression. Here, we use a combination of longitudinal ecological momentary assessments of depression, neurocognitive sampling synchronized with electroencephalography, and lifestyle data from wearables to generate individualized predictions of depressed mood over a 1-month time period. This study, thus, develops a systematic pipeline for N-of-1 personalized modeling of depression using multiple modalities of data. In the models, we integrate seven types of supervised machine learning (ML) approaches for each individual, including ensemble learning and regression-based methods. All models were verified using fourfold nested cross-validation. The best-fit as benchmarked by the lowest mean absolute percentage error, was obtained by a different type of ML model for each individual, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. The voting regressor, which is a composite strategy across ML models, was best performing on-average across subjects. However, the individually selected best-fit models still showed significantly less error than the voting regressor performance across subjects. For each individual’s best-fit personalized model, we further extracted top-feature predictors using Shapley statistics. Shapley values revealed distinct feature determinants of depression over time for each person ranging from co-morbid anxiety, to physical exercise, diet, momentary stress and breathing performance, sleep times, and neurocognition. In future, these personalized features can serve as targets for a personalized ML-guided, multimodal treatment strategy for depression.",Translational Psychiatry,journal,['JournalArticle'],18232e92-ef10-46fd-ad77-bb418dcd525d,Translational Psychiatry,,11,N/A,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,64,109,"Rutvik Shah, G.

This paper describes the development of a model for the turbulence spectrum measured by a short-range, continuous-wave lidar. The lidar performance was assessed by measurements conducted with two WindScanners in an open jet wind tunnel equipped with an active grid, for a range of different turbulent wind conditions. A one-dimensional hot wire anemometer was used as a reference for characterising the lidar turbulence measurement. In addition to addressing the statistics, the correlation between the time series and the mean error on the wind speed, the lidar measurement turbulence spectrum is compared with a theoretical spectrum using Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A theoretical model for the probe length averaging effect is applied in the frequency domain, using a Lorentzian filter in combination with generated white noise, and evaluated by qualitatively matching the lidar measurement spectrum. High goodness of fit coefficients and low mean absolute errors between hot wire and WindScanner were observed for the measured time series. The correlation showed an inverse relationship with the prevalent turbulence intensity in the flow for cases with a comparable power spectrum shape. Larger flow structures can be captured more accurately by the lidar, whereas small-scale turbulent flow structures are partly filtered out as a result of the lidars' probe volume averaging. It is demonstrated that an accurate way to define the frequency at which the lidar power spectrum starts to deviate from the hot wire reference spectrum is the point at which the coherence drops below 0.5. This coherence-based cut-off frequency increases linearly with the mean wind speed and is generally an order of magnitude lower than the probe length cut-off frequency, estimated according to a simple model based on Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A convincing match between the modelled and the actual WindScanner power spectrum was found for various different cases, which confirmed that the deviation of the lidar measurement power spectrum in the higher frequency range can be analytically explained and modelled as a combination of a Lorentzian probe length averaging effect and white noise in the lidar measurement.

The technique is applied after quality assurance/quality control (QAQC) processing to quantify residual error, both bias and random, from solid-body interference, shot noise, and any additional uncertainty introduced to the data from the QAQC process itself. The approach follows from the one-time construction of a high-dimensional parametric database of synthetic lidar spectra and subsequent processing with an existing QAQC technique. A model of the correspondence between the spectral shape and the associated residual errors due to non-ideal features is then developed for quantities of interest (QOIs) including the geometric median and spectral standard deviation of line-of-sight velocity. The model is preliminarily implemented within a neural network framework that is then applied in post-processing to sample returns from a DTU SpinnerLidar. The initial analysis uncovers the effects of specific sources of uncertainty in the context of both individual spectra and full-field maps of the measurement domain.

A rig for calibrating a continuous-wave coherent Doppler wind lidar has been constructed. The rig consists of a rotating flywheel on a frame together with an adjustable lidar telescope. The laser beam points toward the rim of the wheel in a plane perpendicular to the wheel's rotation axis, and it can be tilted up and down along the wheel's periphery and thereby measure different projections of the tangential speed. The angular speed of the wheel is measured using a high-precision measuring ring fitted to the periphery of the wheel and synchronously logged together with the lidar speed. A simple geometrical model shows that there is a linear relationship between the measured line-of-sight speed and the beam tilt angle, and this is utilised to extrapolate to the tangential speed as measured by the lidar. An analysis of the uncertainties based on the model shows that a standard uncertainty on the measurement of about 0.1 % can be achieved, but also that the main source of uncertainty is the width of the laser beam and its associated uncertainty. Measurements performed with different beam widths confirm this. Other measurements with a minimised beam radius show that the method in this case performs about equally well for all the tested reference speeds ranging from about 3 to 18 m s−1.

Due to the complexity, variability, and asymmetry of information, the construction of traditional information dissemination index systems demands excessive reliance on manual intervention, has large deviations, and is applied in a limited range. Such shortcomings cannot meet the requirements of constructing an objective, comprehensive, and highly credible index system. Therefore, we propose a method of constructing a multilevel and multigranular information dissemination index system with complex perspectives. In addition, we use the deep learning method of the convolutional neural network to extract the rich convolution features of public opinion events in the information dissemination process. Then, we train the weight, and it forms the corresponding weight of the information dissemination index systems. The experimental results prove that the method we use is superior to other methods and has better performance on the data set of a specific field.",Frontiers of Physics,journal,,f0455aa5-b1f5-47b0-afdb-accda588a9c4,,,10,N/A,2022,2022-03-07 00:00:00,4,23,"Weihong Han, Linhe Xiao, Xiaobo Wu, D.

The consumer culture of livestream e-commerce is becoming popular in China. However, a report from Southern Finance Omnimedia Corp of China pointed out that among China's top 1,000 livestream sellers, the top 20 sellers have contributed to nearly half of the gross merchandise volume (GMV), using three major Chinese streaming platforms: Taobao, Douyin, and Kuaishou. Moreover, a novice in livestream e-commerce knows less about the important impact factors of the realm. Akin to the adage, “well aware is well prepared,” knowing more about the influencing factors of livestream e-commerce more will be the chances to promote the commercial value. A benchmark research is needed to systematically trace out the most important and influencing factors and to make possible the rising of selling with less effort, hence this study. The research intends to sort out the relevant influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce by reviewing previous related literature. Then, through the Delphi method, eight experts constructed the 14 main influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce. Through DEMATEL-ANP, we can not only find the key factors but also sort out the causal relationship between the main key factors, forming a preliminary evaluation model of the commercial value of livestream sellers. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) of these impact factors found that “seller popularity” is the most critical factor affecting consumers’ shopping motivation. At the same time, product discounts, product quality, and the attractiveness of the sellers are being included in effects by the “seller popularity.” The investigation followed in this study revealed that characteristics of the livestream seller are one of the most influencing factor achieving a total weight of 0.3020, whereas the streaming platform is the least influencing factor (total weight is 0.1333). The assessment made the study explore the sustainability of livestream e-commerce in China, and the proposed evaluation model can be used for the preliminary business value evaluation of people engaged in livestream sellers and related industries.",Scientific Programming,journal,['Review'],d5b215f3-f737-45b2-875b-df309ce14c43,Scientific Programming,,,N/A,2022,2022-02-21 00:00:00,14,87,"Haonan Cheng, Yitian Huang, Jesheng Huang","2182553767, 115026140, 2155720642",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9710f7a0bf137cf2610bc6b1ebcf5319b1cb711e,"Business, Computer Science, Economics, Medicine",2182553767

We propose the LDA-ARMA deep neural network for dynamic presentation and fine-grained categorization of a public opinion events. This was applied to a huge quantity of online public opinion texts in a complicated setting and integrated the proposed sentiment measurement algorithm. To begin, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to extract information about the topic of comments. The autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) was then utilized to perform multidimensional sentiment analysis and evolution prediction on large-scale textual data related to COVID-19 published by netizens from Wuhan and other countries on Sina Weibo. The results show that Wuhan netizens paid more attention to the development of the situation, treatment measures, and policies related to COVID-19 than other issues, and were under greater emotional pressure, whereas netizens in the rest of the country paid more attention to the overall COVID-19 prevention and control, and were more positive and optimistic with the assistance of the government and NGOs. The average error in predicting public opinion sentiment was less than 5.64%, demonstrating that this approach may be effectively applied to the analysis of large-scale online public sentiment evolution.",Complex & Intelligent Systems,journal,['JournalArticle'],d30c9917-b233-46f4-a644-8e5cdf6d6c5e,Complex & Intelligent Systems,3165 - 3178,7,N/A,2021,2021-09-04 00:00:00,23,29,"Muni Zhuang, Yong Li, Xin Tan, Lining Xing, Xin Lu","114556431, 2154403803, 144184998, 3221314, 2124828121",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/632b89ad9807650c69e4ccaa00d5f6231df451dc,"Computer Science, Medicine, Political Science",114556431

The guidance of public opinion in the converged media environment is a new research topic. Users participate in the discussion of different media, and flow in and out from different media, which gradually generate a new complex dynamics model of the dissemination of public opinion information. An index system for evaluating the influence of converged media communication that combines the advantages of traditional media and new media is constructed. We use AHP to determine the index weights in the evaluation system and conduct consistency tests. The final weight of each media is determined through the combination of subjective and objective methods, which provides data supports for later determining the participation of various media in the dissemination process of public opinion information. Based on the SIR model, a UCIR (unknown-contact-infected-recovered) dynamic model is established. The simulation results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the UCIR model is 31.6% lower than that of the SIR model. Finally, by fixing the key parameters α, β, θ, ε, p, q in the UCIR model, and changing only one of them, we studied the effect of the transition probability between different states on the process of public opinion information transmission, and then proposed corresponding guidance. In addition, from the two perspectives of network media and government, the countermeasures and suggestions for the guidance of public opinion are proposed. We try to solve the problems of humanities and social sciences with the method of natural science. These research results can provide theoretical and methodological support for people to understand the law of public opinion information transmission and establish a guiding mechanism for public opinion information transmission.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,"

However, the network public opinion tends to generate strongly misleading and a large number of messages can cause shocks to the public once major emergencies appear. Therefore, we need to make correct prediction regarding and timely identify a potential crisis in the early warning of network public opinion. In view of this, this study fully considers the features of development and the propagation characteristics, so as to construct a network public opinion early warning index system that includes 4 first-level indicators and 13 second-level indicators. The weight of each indicator is calculated by the “CRITIC” method, so that the comprehensive evaluation value of each time point can be obtained and the early warning level of internet public opinion can be divided. Then, the Back Propagation neural network based on Genetic Algorithm (GA-BP) is used to establish a network public opinion early warning model. Finally, the major public health emergency, COVID-19 pandemic, is taken as a case for empirical analysis. The results show that by comparing with the traditional classification methods, such as BP neural network, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and naive Bayes, GA-BP neural network has a higher accuracy rate for early warning of network public opinion. Consequently, the index system and early warning model constructed in this study have good feasibility and can provide references for related research on internet public opinion.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,Ieee Access,44162 - 44172,9,N/A,2021,2021-03-17 00:00:00,19,25,"Lijuan Peng, Xigao Shao, Wan-Ming Huang","1807740402, 2801293, 2109163814",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9f76539690fd601bf0ecda6f9b3c689bc6bf79f,"Computer Science, Medicine, Political Science",1807740402

Monitoring grapevine water status and stress level across the whole vineyard is an essential step for precision irrigation management of vineyards to conserve water. We developed a unified machine learning model to map leaf water potential ( $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf ), by combining high-resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery and weather data. We conducted six unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights with a five-band multispectral camera from 2018 to 2020 over three commercial vineyards, concurrently with ground measurements of sampled vines. Using vegetation indices from the orthomosaiced UAV imagery and weather data as predictors, the random forest (RF) full model captured 77% of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf variance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 MPa, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.100 MPa, based on the validation datasets. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and red edge indices such as the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) were found as the most important variables in estimating $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf across space and time. The reduced RF models excluding weather and red edge indices explained 52–48% of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf variance, respectively. Maps of the estimated $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf from the RF full model captured well the patterns of both within- and cross-field spatial variability and the temporal change of vine water status, consistent with irrigation management and patterns observed from the ground sampling. Our results demonstrated the utility of UAV-based aerial multispectral imaging for supplementing and scaling up the traditional point-based ground sampling of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf . The pre-trained machine learning model, driven by UAV imagery and weather data, provides a cost-effective and scalable tool to facilitate data-driven precision irrigation management at individual vine levels in vineyards.",Irrigation science,journal,,bfe7cd76-b337-419a-95e7-32b82ec6cdb5,Irrigation Science,715-730,40,N/A,2022,2022-04-18 00:00:00,30,69,"Zhehan Tang, Yufang Jin, M.

Reflectance indices obtained by an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Spec 4 hyperspectral spectrometer from tomato growth in two soil texture types exposed to four water stress levels (70–100% FC, 60–70% FC, 50–60% FC, and 40–50% FC) was deployed to schedule irrigation and management of crops’ water stress. The treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in a 2 × 4 factorial experiment. Water stress treatments were monitored with Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) every 12 h before and after irrigation to maintain soil water content at the desired (FC%). Soil electrical conductivity (Ec) was measured daily throughout the growth cycle of tomatoes in both soil types. Ec was revealing a strong correlation with water stress at R2 above 0.95 p < 0.001. Yield was measured at the end of the end of the growing season. The results revealed that yield had a high correlation with water stress at R2 = 0.9758 and 0.9816 p < 0.01 for sandy loam and silty loam soils, respectively. Leaf temperature (LT °C), relative leaf water content (RLWC), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), Leaf area index (LAI), were measured at each growth stage at the same time spectral reflectance data were measured throughout the growth period. Spectral reflectance indices used were grouped into three: (1) greenness vegetative indices; (2) water overtone vegetation indices; (3) Photochemical Reflectance Index centered at 570 nm (PRI570), and normalized PRI (PRInorm). These reflectance indices were strongly correlated with all four water stress indicators and yield. The results revealed that NDVI, RDVI, WI, NDWI, NDWI1640, PRI570, and PRInorm were the most sensitive indices for estimating crop water stress at each growth stage in both sandy loam and silty loam soils at R2 above 0.35.

Breeding programs are in search of new drought tolerant forage grass varieties, but those programs still rely on time-consuming and less consistent visual scoring by breeders. In this study, we evaluate whether Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing can complement or replace this visual breeder score. A field experiment was set up to test the drought tolerance of genotypes from three common forage types of two different species: Festuca arundinacea, diploid Lolium perenne and tetraploid Lolium perenne. Drought stress was imposed by using mobile rainout shelters. UAV flights with RGB and thermal sensors were conducted at five time points during the experiment. Visual-based indices from different colour spaces were selected that were closely correlated to the breeder score. Furthermore, several indices, in particular H and NDLab, from the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and CIELab (Commission Internationale de l’éclairage) colour space, respectively, displayed a broad-sense heritability that was as high or higher than the visual breeder score, making these indices highly suited for high-throughput field phenotyping applications that can complement or even replace the breeder score. The thermal-based Crop Water Stress Index CWSI provided complementary information to visual-based indices, enabling the analysis of differences in ecophysiological mechanisms for coping with reduced water availability between species and ploidy levels. All species/types displayed variation in drought stress tolerance, which confirms that there is sufficient variation for selection within these groups of grasses. Our results confirmed the better drought tolerance potential of Festuca arundinacea, but also showed which Lolium perenne genotypes are more tolerant.",Remote Sensing,journal,['JournalArticle'],8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

Utilizing the rule of deep learning (DL), we introduce and fine-tune two robust frameworks, ResNet 50 and Inception V3, specifically designed for the classification of brain MRI images. Building upon the previous success of ResNet 50 and Inception V3 in classifying other medical imaging datasets, our investigation encompasses datasets with distinct characteristics, including one with four classes and another with two. The primary contribution of our research lies in the meticulous curation of these paired datasets. We have also integrated essential techniques, including Early Stopping and ReduceLROnPlateau, to refine the model through hyperparameter optimization. This involved adding extra layers, experimenting with various loss functions and learning rates, and incorporating dropout layers and regularization to ensure model convergence in predictions. Furthermore, strategic enhancements, such as customized pooling and regularization layers, have significantly elevated the accuracy of our models, resulting in remarkable classification accuracy. Notably, the pairing of ResNet 50 with the Nadam optimizer yields extraordinary accuracy rates, reaching 99.34% for gliomas, 93.52% for meningiomas, 98.68% for non-tumorous images, and 97.70% for pituitary tumors. These results underscore the transformative potential of our custom-made approach, achieving an aggregate testing accuracy of 97.68% for these four distinct classes. In a two-class dataset, Resnet 50 with the Adam optimizer excels, demonstrating better precision, recall, F1 score, and an overall accuracy of 99.84%. Moreover, it attains perfect per-class accuracy of 99.62% for ‘Tumor Positive’ and 100% for ‘Tumor Negative’, underscoring a remarkable advancement in the realm of brain tumor categorization. This research underscores the innovative possibilities of DL models and our specialized optimization methods in the domain of diagnosing brain cancer from MRI images.",BioMedInformatics,,['JournalArticle'],ba99c66b-8fcf-4965-b5d3-7f0bbbbe6ed4,BioMedInformatics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-12-06 00:00:00,21,24,"Syed Ahmmed, Prajoy Podder, M.

Big data is a crucial aspect of modern computing, and the choice of processing framework can significantly impact performance and efficiency. The technical revolution of big data has changed how organizations handle and value large databases. As data quantities expand quickly, effective and scalable data processing systems are essential. MapReduce and Apache Spark are two of the most popular large data processing techniques. This study compares these two frameworks to determine their merits, shortcomings, and applicability for big data applications. Nearly quintillion bytes of data are created daily. Approximately 90% of data was produced in the previous two years. At this stage, data comes from temperature sensors, social media, movies, photographs, transaction records (like banking records), mobile phone conversations, GPS signals, etc. In this article, all key big data technologies are introduced. This document compares all big data technologies and discusses their merits and downsides. Run trials using multiple data sets of varying sizes to validate and explain the study. Graphical depiction shows how one tool outperforms others for given data. Big Data is data generated by the rapid usage of the internet, sensors, and heavy machinery, with great volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Numbers, photos, videos, and text are omnipresent in every sector. Due to the pace and amount of data generation, the computing system struggles to manage large data. Data is stored in a distributed architectural file system due to its size and complexity. Big distributed file systems, which must be fault-tolerant, adaptable, and scalable, make complicated data analysis dangerous and time-consuming. Big data collection is called ‘datafication’. Big data is ‘datafied’ for productivity. Organisation alone does not make Big Data valuable; we must choose what we can do with it.",World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,journal,['JournalArticle'],fdeb5c51-251b-4f10-aaec-bf0b5adc6beb,World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,,,N/A,2023,2023-10-30 00:00:00,17,23,"Sifat Ibtisum, Ehsan Bazgir, S.

However, at present, they do not seem to exploit all their potential. The objective of this study is to explore innovative proposals for the use of wearable wrist technology in the field of sports, to understand its potential and identify new challenges and lines of future research related to this technology. A systematic review of the scientific literature, collected in 4 major repositories, was carried out to locate research initiatives where wrist wearables were introduced to address some sports-related challenges. Those works that were limited to evaluating sensor performance in sports activities and those in which wrist wearable devices did not play a significant role were excluded. 26 articles were eventually selected for full-text analysis that discuss the introduction of wrist-worn wearables to address some innovative use in the sports field. This study showcases relevant proposals in 10 different sports. The research initiatives identified are oriented to the use of wearable wrist technology (i) for the comprehensive monitoring of sportspeople’s behavior in activities not supported by the vendors, (ii) to identify specific types of movements or actions in specific sports, and (iii) to prevent injuries. There are, however, open issues that should be tackled in the future, such as the incorporation of these devices in sports activities not currently addressed, or the provision of specific recommendation services for sport practitioners.",Electronics,journal,['Review'],ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2019,2019-11-01 00:00:00,32,79,"Juan M.

These systems improve the quality of life and the health care of the elderly and dependent people. However, before making them available to end users, it is necessary to evaluate their performance in recognizing activities of daily living, using data set benchmarks in experimental scenarios. For that reason, the scientific community has developed and provided a huge amount of data sets for HAR. Therefore, identifying which ones to use in the evaluation process and which techniques are the most appropriate for prediction of HAR in a specific context is not a trivial task and is key to further progress in this area of research. This work presents a systematic review of the literature of the sensor-based data sets used to evaluate ARS. On the one hand, an analysis of different variables taken from indexed publications related to this field was performed. The sources of information are journals, proceedings, and books located in specialized databases. The analyzed variables characterize publications by year, database, type, quartile, country of origin, and destination, using scientometrics, which allowed identification of the data set most used by researchers. On the other hand, the descriptive and functional variables were analyzed for each of the identified data sets: occupation, annotation, approach, segmentation, representation, feature selection, balancing and addition of instances, and classifier used for recognition. This paper provides an analysis of the sensor-based data sets used in HAR to date, identifying the most appropriate dataset to evaluate ARS and the classification techniques that generate better results.",IEEE Access,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,59192-59210,6,N/A,2018,2018-09-22 00:00:00,146,131,"Emiro De-la-Hoz-Franco, P.

Based on a large cohort of newly diagnosed CLL/SLL patients from China, we investigated immunophenotypes, genetic abnormalities, and their correlations. Eighty-four percent of the CLL/SLL patients showed typical immunophenotypes with scores of 4 or 5 points in the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) scoring system (classic group), and the remaining 16% of patients were atypical with scores lower than 4 points (atypical group). Trisomy 12 and variants of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, ATM, and MYD88 were the most recurrent genetic aberrations. Additionally, unsupervised genomic analysis based on molecular genetics revealed distinctive characteristics of MYD88 variants in CLL/SLL. By overlapping different correlation grouping analysis from genetics to immunophenotypes, the results showed MYD88 variants to be highly related to atypical CLL/SLL immunophenotypes. Furthermore, compared with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the genetic landscape showed potential value in clinical differential diagnosis of atypical CLL/SLL and MCL patients.

Little is known about how EZH2 affects patients’ response to therapy. In this context, the aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the frequency of mutations in EZH2 at diagnosis in tissue and ctDNA in patients with FL and to assess the patients’ outcomes after receiving immunochemotherapy, depending on the EZH2 mutation status. Among the 154 patients included in the study, 27% had mutated EZH2 (46% with high-grade and 26% with low-grade FL). Of the mutated tissue samples, the mutation in ctDNA was identified in 44% of cases. EZH2 mutation in ctDNA was not identified in any patient unmutated in the tissue. Unmutated patients who received R-CHOP had significantly more relapses than patients who received R-Bendamustine (16/49 vs. 2/23, p  = 0.040). Furthermore, our results show that patients with mutated EZH2 treated with R-CHOP vs. those treated with R-Bendamustine present a lower incidence of relapse (10% vs. 42% p  = 0.09 at 4 years), a higher PFS (92% vs. 40% p  = 0.039 at 4 years), and higher OS (100% vs. 78% p  = 0.039 at 4 years). Based on these data, RCHOP could be a more suitable regimen for mutated patients, and R-bendamustine for unmutated patients.

Germline variants can influence treatment response and contribute to the development of treatment-related second neoplasms, especially in childhood leukemia. We aimed to analyze the genomes of patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders for the discovery of genes enriched in rare pathogenic variants. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in germline rare and dysfunctional variants. Additionally, we detected rare and likely pathogenic variants associated with disease prognosis and potential druggability, indicating a relevant role of these events in the variability of cancer phenotypes. Abstract There is growing evidence indicating the implication of germline variation in cancer predisposition and prognostication. Here, we describe an analysis of likely disruptive rare variants across the genomes of 726 patients with B-cell lymphoid neoplasms. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in rare dysfunctional variants, both of which participate in the regulation of oxidative stress pathways (CHMP6 and GSTA4). Additionally, we detected 1675 likely disrupting variants in genes associated with cancer, of which 44.75% were novel events and 7.88% were protein-truncating variants. Among these, the most frequently affected genes were ATM, BIRC6, CLTCL1A, and TSC2. Homozygous or germline double-hit variants were detected in 28 cases, and coexisting somatic events were observed in 17 patients, some of which affected key lymphoma drivers such as ATM, KMT2D, and MYC. Finally, we observed that variants in six different genes were independently associated with shorter survival in CLL. Our study results support an important role for rare germline variation in the pathogenesis and prognosis of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms.",Cancers,journal,['JournalArticle'],d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,13,N/A,2021,2021-03-01 00:00:00,13,88,"A.

Recent studies suggest that the immune microenvironment plays a role in treatment response prediction and survival in DLBCL. This study developed a risk prediction model and evaluated the model’s biological implications in association with the estimated profiles of immune infiltration. Gene-expression profiling of 718 patients with DLBCL was done, for which RNA sequencing data and clinical covariates were obtained from Reddy et al. (2017). Using unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to identify survival-associated gene signatures, a multivariable model of survival was constructed. Tumor-infiltrating immune cell compositions were enumerated using CIBERSORT deconvolution analysis. A four gene-signature-based score was developed that separated patients into high- and low-risk groups. The combination of the gene-expression-based score with the IPI improved the discrimination on the validation and complete sets. The gene signatures were successfully validated with the deconvolution output. Correlating the deconvolution findings with the gene signatures and risk score, CD8+ T-cells and naïve CD4+ T-cells were associated with favorable prognosis.

Results Six features, including disease severity, age, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were selected as predictors for COVID-19 mortality. Simple-tree XGBoost model conducted by these features can predict death risk accurately with >90% precision and >85% sensitivity, as well as F1 scores >0.90 in training and validation sets. Conclusion We proposed the disease severity, age, serum levels of hs-CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-10 as significant predictors for death risk of COVID-19, which may help to identify the high-risk COVID-19 cases. KEY MESSAGES A machine learning method is used to build death risk model for COVID-19 patients. Disease severity, age, hs-CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-10 are death risk factors. These findings may help to identify the high-risk COVID-19 cases.",Annals medicus,journal,['JournalArticle'],74354a44-4ffc-4c14-b0f4-f5dde6c5b730,Annals of Medicine,257 - 266,53,N/A,2021,2021-01-01 00:00:00,102,40,"X.

07a5a4418c0b84a88c2a03487affcccc4bf245e7,10.2196/17125,A Deep Artificial Neural Network−Based Model for Prediction of Underlying Cause of Death From Death Certificates: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Background Coding of underlying causes of death from death certificates is a process that is nowadays undertaken mostly by humans with potential assistance from expert systems, such as the Iris software. It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the CépiDc (Centre d’épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de Décès) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner. Objective This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death. Methods The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject’s age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject’s underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network−based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach’s superiority was assessed via bootstrap. Results The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010. Conclusions This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.",JMIR Medical Informatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],dc6419f3-98b3-4718-bba0-6b6d6c3d192b,JMIR Medical Informatics,,8,N/A,2020,2020-04-01 00:00:00,18,43,"Louis Falissard, C.

This work studies a mathematical problem motivated by the bi‐objective optimization of data‐parallel applications on such platforms for performance and energy. First, we formulate the problem and present an exact algorithm of polynomial complexity solving the problem where all the application profiles of objective type one are continuous and strictly increasing, and all the application profiles of objective type two are linear increasing. We then apply the algorithm to develop solutions for two related optimization problems of parallel applications on heterogeneous hybrid platforms, one for performance and dynamic energy and the other for performance and total energy. Our proposed solution methods are then employed to solve the two bi‐objective optimization problems for two data‐parallel applications, matrix multiplication and gene sequencing, on a hybrid platform employing five heterogeneous processors, namely, two different Intel multicore CPUs, an Nvidia K40c GPU, an Nvidia P100 PCIe GPU, and an Intel Xeon Phi.",Concurrency and Computation,journal,['JournalArticle'],312ca99c-9149-490d-813e-c60d5e949f65,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,,35,N/A,2022,2022-09-02 00:00:00,4,39,"Hamidreza Khaleghzadeh, Ravi Reddy, Alexey L.

Effective diagnosis, treatment, and referral of CKD depend heavily on early identification and prediction of the disease. However, it is difficult to evaluate and derive significant insights from health data due to its vast and complicated nature. Engineers and medical researchers are using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to create predictive models for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an effort to address this issue. The goal of this research is to create and validate predictive models for chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on a variety of clinical factors, including albuminuria, age, diet, eGFR, and pre-existing medical problems. The objective is to estimate the likelihood of renal failure, which may necessitate kidney dialysis or a transplant, and to evaluate the degree of kidney disease. With the use of this knowledge, patients and healthcare providers should be able to make well-informed decisions about diagnosis, treatment, and lifestyle changes. Patterns in the gathered data can be found, and future incidence of CKD or other related diseases can be predicted, by utilising MLT such as ANN and data mining techniques. Finding novel characteristics linked to the onset of renal disease and adding more trustworthy data from CKD patients. The best algorithm to categorise the data as CKD or NOT_CKD is chosen throughout the design process, and the data is then classified according to this differentiation. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which offers important details about the patient's current kidney function, is used to classify cases of chronic kidney disease. By combining complete patient data with machine learning algorithms, this research advances the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and improves patient outcomes.",European Journal of Theoretical and Applied Sciences,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,European Journal of Theoretical and Applied Sciences,,,Unknown,2023,2023-11-01 00:00:00,19,14,"Aqeel Ahmed, Gul Ahmed, Ehtesham Qureshi, Shakeel Ahmed","2281640524, 2282210310, 2282212658, 2281613942",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05138e7b40a9eb0f859070a4da243337ebd66559,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2281640524

Then, we describe artificial visual processing techniques that are aimed at understanding of the captured scenery in a mathematical/logical way. We continue with a survey of textural defect detection based on statistical, structural and other approaches. Finally, we report the state of the art for approaching the detection and classification of defects through supervised and non-supervised classifiers and deep learning.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,20,20203dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2020,2020-03-01 00:00:00,255,227,"Tamás Czimmermann, G.

It has no cure and the symptoms vary widely, depending on the affected regions, amount of damage, and the ability to activate compensatory mechanisms, which constitutes a challenge to evaluate and predict its course. Additionally, relapsing-remitting patients can evolve its course into a secondary progressive, characterized by a slow progression of disability independent of relapses. With clinical information from Multiple Sclerosis patients, we developed a machine learning exploration framework concerning this disease evolution, more specifically to obtain three predictions: one on conversion to secondary progressive course and two on disease severity with rapid accumulation of disability, concerning the 6th and 10th years of progression.

An EDSS measurement contains an overall ‘EDSS’ score and several functional subscores. Typically, expert knowledge is required to interpret consult notes and generate these scores. Previous approaches used limited context length Word2Vec embeddings and keyword searches to predict scores given a consult note, but often failed when scores were not explicitly stated. In this work, we present MS-BERT, the first publicly available transformer model trained on real clinical data other than MIMIC. Next, we present MSBC, a classifier that applies MS-BERT to generate embeddings and predict EDSS and functional subscores. Lastly, we explore combining MSBC with other models through the use of Snorkel to generate scores for unlabelled consult notes. MSBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on all metrics and prediction tasks and outperforms the models generated from the Snorkel ensemble. We improve Macro-F1 by 0.12 (to 0.88) for predicting EDSS and on average by 0.29 (to 0.63) for predicting functional subscores over previous Word2Vec CNN and rule-based approaches.",Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop,conference,['JournalArticle'],a631cd93-9863-44c8-8dff-9eb3fbf4f83e,ArXiv,,abs/2010.15316,2020a631cd93-9863-44c8-8dff-9eb3fbf4f83e,2020,2020-10-29 00:00:00,12,44,"Alister D Costa, Stefan Denkovski, Michal Malyska, S.

These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. Most graph neural networks can be described in terms of message passing, vertex update, and readout functions. In this paper, we represent documents as word co-occurrence networks and propose an application of the message passing framework to NLP, the Message Passing Attention network for Document understanding (MPAD). We also propose several hierarchical variants of MPAD. Experiments conducted on 10 standard text classification datasets show that our architectures are competitive with the state-of-the-art.

The main objectives of this study were to use a feature engineering approach to incorporate clinical expert knowledge prior to applying machine learning techniques, and to assess the impact of the approach on model complexity and performance. Four machine learning models were trained to predict mortality with a severe asthma case study. Experiments to select fewer input features based on a discriminative score showed low to moderate precision for discovering clinically meaningful triplets, indicating that discriminative score alone cannot replace clinical input. When compared to baseline machine learning models, we found a decrease in model complexity with use of fewer features informed by discriminative score and filtering of laboratory features with clinical input. We also found a small difference in performance for the mortality prediction task when comparing baseline ML models to models that used filtered features. Encoding demographic and triplet information in ML models with filtered features appeared to show performance improvements from the baseline. These findings indicated that the use of filtered features may reduce model complexity, and with little impact on performance.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,15,N/A,2020,2020-04-23 00:00:00,28,29,"Kenneth D Roe, Vibhu Jawa, X.

A panel regression model analyzes trade between Russia and its 15 top trading partners, exploring both direct and indirect effects. The analysis focuses on how accumulated foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange rate fluctuations mediate these relationships. The findings reveal that global geopolitical instability decrease Russian trade by 0.0558. Interestingly, this negative impact is partially mediated by a decrease in FDI (-0.0805). This aligns with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, which show a significant negative effect of global geopolitical instability on FDI (-1.209). This suggests that FDI acts as a key transmitter of the negative effects of global instability on Russian trade. The role of exchange rate fluctuations, however, is more complex. While the Sobel Test indicated a negative indirect effect, the SEM analysis shows a positive indirect effect through exchange rate fluctuations on trade. This suggests potentially countervailing effects of currency fluctuations, with depreciation potentially incentivizing exports while appreciation might make imports cheaper. The impact of country-specific geopolitical instability varies depending on the context. Industries like food products and textiles are significantly affected by geopolitical instability increase, while sectors such as fuels, metals and raw materials show resilience. Close trading partners are less affected by global instability but suffer from partner- specific instability. Geographically, Western Europe benefits from global instability but faces challenges from partner-specific instability, contrasting with Eastern Europe and Asia. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how geopolitical instability, mediated by FDI and exchange rates, shapes Russia's trade performance.",International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],dc8f13a2-4e40-4171-8418-7e5648ecf441,International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology (IJISRT),,,N/A,2024,2024-08-03 00:00:00,929,17,Pavel Talamanov,2200259444,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9b0bcfe881b6c90f76dfe7a913b0e022682ceb5,"Economics, Political Science",2200259444

In this age of Industry 4.0 the fruit sorting is an important part in the food processing wherein this work plays a vital role. In this study, a solution for the detection and classification of apple fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. Deep learning models offer promise for automating disease identification using fruit images, but encounter obstacles such as therequirement for extensive training data, computational complexity, and the risk of overfitting. This study introduces an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture aimed at addressing these challenges by incorporating a reduced number of layers, thus alleviating computational burdens while maintaining performance. Additionally, augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are employed to diversify the training set without additional image acquisition. Our CNN model is specifically trained to identify common apple crop diseases like Scab, Rot, and Blotch. Rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness ofour model, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 95.37%. Significantly, our model demonstrates reduced storage requirements and faster execution times compared to existing deep CNN architectures, enabling deployment on handheld devices and resource-limited environments. While other CNN models may offer similar accuracy levels, our approach emphasizes efficiency and resource optimization, rendering it practical for real-world applications in agriculture. Furthermore, our CNN model exhibits resilience to environmental variations and imaging parameters, enhancing its applicability across diverse agricultural settings. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the approach developed in this experimental work contributes to modernizing fruits and vegetables sorting operations in food processing, crop management practices thus promoting agricultural sustainability. The scalability and portability of our model make it suitable for deployment in both small-scale farms and large-scale agricultural operations.",International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],dc8f13a2-4e40-4171-8418-7e5648ecf441,International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology (IJISRT),,,N/A,2024,2024-07-25 00:00:00,926,51,"Arpit Patidar, Abir Chakravorty","2301073891, 95703942",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d2c38b39f73003ec23ee3e2382e319e20bd5d18,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science",2301073891

Various kinds of waste often occur in the production process, one of which is caused by a poor layout of facilities, for example the arrangement of machines on the production line that is not suitable. This is a problem in the production process of machining cylinder comp at PT. Jakarta Automotive. With the aim of finding out the factors that cause product defects in machining cylinder comp and finding design of improvement proposals to reduce the defects that occur, this study uses a quantitative method to find DPMO and sigma values as an analysis of the cause of the problem. The result of this study was the discovery of less than optimal engine layout settings that caused TAP NG defects in the product. So that a design of a proposed improvement was made in the form of a change in the engine layout. In conclusion, in this study, it was identified that the non-optimal engine layout was the cause of the high defects.

Viable computational methods that can facilitate tailored intervention while tolerating sequencing biases are in high demand. Here we propose a class of transparent and interpretable computational methods called integral genomic signature (iGenSig) analyses, that address the challenges of cross-dataset modeling through leveraging information redundancies within high-dimensional genomic features, averaging feature weights to prevent overweighing, and extracting unbiased genomic information from large tumor cohorts. Using genomic dataset of chemical perturbations, we develop a battery of iGenSig models for predicting cancer drug responses, and validate the models using independent cell-line and clinical datasets. The iGenSig models for five drugs demonstrate predictive values in six clinical studies, among which the Erlotinib and 5-FU models significantly predict therapeutic responses in three studies, offering clinically relevant insights into their inverse predictive signature pathways. Together, iGenSig provides a computational framework to facilitate tailored cancer therapy based on multi-omics data. Predicting drug responses in cancer patients requires robust computational frameworks. Here, the authors develop an integral genomic signature —iGenSig— approach to predict drug responses using multi-omics data from tumour samples, and validate this approach using genomic datasets from multiple clinical studies.",Nature Communications,journal,['JournalArticle'],43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,13,N/A,2022,2022-05-26 00:00:00,6,58,"Xiao-Song Wang, Sanghoon Lee, Han Zhang, G.

Here, we present decoupleR, a Bioconductor package containing computational methods to extract these activities within a unified framework. decoupleR allows us to flexibly run any method with a given resource, including methods that leverage mode of regulation and weights of interactions. Using decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of methods on transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments. Our findings suggest that simple linear models and the consensus score across methods perform better than other methods at predicting perturbed regulators.

Mechanistically, this involves signal-processing through a complex network of molecular interactions that govern transcription factor activity patterns. Computer simulations of the information flow through this network could help predict cellular responses in health and disease. Here we develop a recurrent neural network framework constrained by prior knowledge of the signaling network with ligand-concentrations as input and transcription factor-activity as output. Applied to synthetic data, it predicts unseen test-data (Pearson correlation r = 0.98) and the effects of gene knockouts (r = 0.8). We stimulate macrophages with 59 different ligands, with and without the addition of lipopolysaccharide, and collect transcriptomics data. The framework predicts this data under cross-validation (r = 0.8) and knockout simulations suggest a role for RIPK1 in modulating the lipopolysaccharide response. This work demonstrates the feasibility of genome-scale simulations of intracellular signaling. Many diseases are caused by disruptions to the network of biochemical reactions that allow cells to respond to external signals.

In this context, the present research comes to connect the local sustainable tourism development with the sporting events, and to come up with relevant proposals for the reference area, but also for their generalization in the whole tourist areas. Based on the research purpose, a quantitative research was conducted on a sample of 448 residents, randomly selected from a sampling frame. Several scales from previous studies were used to collect primary data, and they were adapted according to the research purpose. Research findings indicate that the acceptance of sustainable tourism development through sports can be predicted by several variables, such as the economic impact (b = 0.343), residents’ attitude towards sports events (b = 0.287), and citizens’ tendency to entrepreneurship (b = 0.113). Additionally, sports events affect the tendency of citizens towards entrepreneurship (r = 0.519, p < 0.01).

This ecosystem makes its presence felt in every aspect of our lives, along with all other emerging technologies. Unfortunately, despite the significant benefits brought by the IoT, the increased attack surface built upon it has become more critical than ever. Devices have limited resources and are not typically created with security features. Lately, a trend of botnet threats transitioning to the IoT environment has been observed, and an army of infected IoT devices can expand quickly and be used for effective attacks. Therefore, identifying proper solutions for securing IoT systems is currently an important and challenging research topic. Machine learning-based approaches are a promising alternative, allowing the identification of abnormal behaviors and the detection of attacks. This paper proposes an anomaly-based detection solution that uses unsupervised deep learning techniques to identify IoT botnet activities. An empirical evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on both balanced and unbalanced datasets to assess its threat detection capability. False-positive rate reduction and its impact on the detection system are also analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison with other unsupervised learning approaches is included. The experimental results reveal the performance of the proposed detection method.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2021,2021-08-04 00:00:00,48,44,"Ioana Apostol, Marius Preda, Constantin Nila, I.

Over a long period, in the railway operation and maintenance process, the railway signaling and communications department has recorded a large amount of unstructured text information about equipment faults in the form of natural language. However, due to irregularities in the recording methods of these data, it is difficult to use directly. In this paper, a method based on natural language processing (NLP) was adopted to analyze and classify this information. First, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was used to extract the semantic features of the text, which were then expressed in the corresponding topic feature space. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to construct a signal equipment fault diagnostic model that reduced the impact of sample data imbalance on the classification accuracy. This was compared and analyzed with the traditional Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms. This study used signal equipment failure text data from the Lan-Xin high-speed railway to conduct experimental analysis and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments showed that the accuracy of the SVM classification algorithm could reach 0.84 after being combined with the LDA topic model, which verifies that the natural language processing method can effectively realize the fault diagnosis of signal equipment and has certain guiding significance for the maintenance of field signal equipment.",Complex,conference,['JournalArticle'],8bc59e8b-e251-4201-839a-ec83ae78859d,Complex.,9126745:1-9126745:13,2021,20218bc59e8b-e251-4201-839a-ec83ae78859d,2021,2021-07-28 00:00:00,11,29,"Lei Shi, Yulin Zhu, Youpeng Zhang, Zhongji Su","2153934130, 2116148860, 145140724, 2051691754",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f254a8ed8c1f3f31d3641db53e21e0e23d670bd,"Computer Science, Engineering",2153934130

Discrimination between these varieties, historically done by ampelography, is done in recent decades mostly by genetic analysis. However, when aiming to identify archaeobotanical remains, which are mostly charred with extremely low genomic preservation, the application of the genomic approach is rarely successful. As a result, variety-level identification of most grape remains is currently prevented. Because grape pips are highly polymorphic, several attempts were made to utilize their morphological diversity as a classification tool, mostly using 2D image analysis technics. Here, we present a highly accurate varietal classification tool using an innovative and accessible 3D seed scanning approach. The suggested classification methodology is machine-learning-based, applied with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique. This methodology achieved classification results of 91% to 93% accuracy in average when trained by fresh or charred seeds to test fresh or charred seeds, respectively. We show that when classifying 8 groups, enhanced accuracy levels can be achieved using a ""tournament"" approach. Future development of this new methodology can lead to an effective seed classification tool, significantly improving the fields of archaeobotany, as well as general taxonomy.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,11,N/A,2021,2021-06-30 00:00:00,15,59,"Vlad Landa, Yekaterina Shapira, Michal David, A.

Sustainability awareness has been gaining attention from many international organizations, resulting in the rise of sports tourism that incorporates sustainability. Therefore, the development of a valid and applicable sustainable sports tourism (SST) assessment model is an important task. In this study, a hybrid Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) model is proposed to measure the development performance of SST. The aims of this study include developing a SST assessment framework, identifying the mutual influential relationships among attributes, generating attribute influence weights, and calculating the performance of the evaluated items. The proposed model is divided into three stages. First, a cause-and-effect diagram is generated using the Grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (GDEMATEL) to describe the interactions and feedback among the attributes. Then, the GDEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (GDANP) is applied to generate the influence weights of the attributes and their rankings. Finally, the expanded Probability-based Grey Relational Analysis (expanded PGRA) was applied to calculate the performance of the evaluated items and to determine the gap between evaluated items and the aspiration level. This study improves the original PGRA technique by introducing the concept of aspiration level into the PGRA calculation process, thereby replacing the traditional concept of “relative satisfaction” with “aspiration level”. In addition, the expanded PGRA can assess a single rated item without being limited to at least two items. We used the Sun Moon Lake Scenic Area in Taiwan as a model demonstration. The results show that the top three attributes that need to be strengthened are disease prevention and treatment, local social welfare and protection, and sports diversity. In the Sun Moon Lake, intersection control should be set up to ensure the health status of visitors and local residents. In addition to epidemic prevention, more measures and behaviors should be developed to deal with tourism diseases. We suggested that subsidies be provided to local residents to rebuild the fences around their homes to avoid disturbances caused by the influx of tourists. Moreover, the local government can create more sports events with special characteristics that can attract tourists to come again and again.",Sustainability,journal,,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,4214,13,N/A,2021,2021-04-10 00:00:00,15,32,"Chin-Cheng Yang, Chih-Chien Shen, Yu-Sheng Lin, Huai-Wei Lo, Jiaqi Wu","46962505, 2976893, 2107930791, 144556608, 2115785222",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d5353d433e4b0e03d106ff73072c24a96b61709,"Business, Computer Science, Environmental Science",46962505

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), as well as adoptive T-cell therapies outside the setting of allo-HSCT, have been approved for distinct haematologic malignancies producing durable responses in otherwise untreatable patients. Despite recent advances, immunotherapies do not benefit most patients, due to resistance or lack of response, and are only approved in specific settings. Moreover, immunotherapies are expensive and may produce severe immune related adverse reactions. Combination therapy complicates the picture and requires further evaluation. This review considers the current status and future perspectives of ICIs and BiTEs approved for haematological malignancies by analysing their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT).

Methods We included 120 patients (positive recurrence = 46 and negative recurrence = 74) referred for PET scanning as a routine part of their care. All patients had a biopsy-proven NSCLC. Nine segmentation methods were applied to each image, including manual delineation, K-means (KM), watershed, fuzzy-C-mean, region-growing, local active contour (LAC), and iterative thresholding (IT) with 40, 45, and 50% thresholds. Diverse image discretizations, both without a filter and with different wavelet decompositions, were applied to PET images. Overall, 6741 radiomic features were extracted from each image (749 radiomic features from each segmented area). Non-parametric empirical Bayes (NPEB) ComBat harmonization was used to harmonize the features. Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) with L1 regularization For feature selection and Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) with fivefold nested cross-validation was performed using StratifiedKFold with ‘n_splits’ set to 5 to predict recurrence in NSCLC patients and assess the impact of ComBat harmonization on the outcome. Results From 749 extracted radiomic features, 206 (27%) and 389 (51%) features showed excellent reliability (ICC ≥ 0.90) against segmentation method variation before and after NPEB ComBat harmonization, respectively. Among all, 39 features demonstrated poor reliability, which declined to 10 after ComBat harmonization. The 64 fixed bin widths (without any filter) and wavelets (LLL)-based radiomic features set achieved the best performance in terms of robustness against diverse segmentation techniques before and after ComBat harmonization. The first-order and GLRLM and also first-order and NGTDM feature families showed the largest number of robust features before and after ComBat harmonization, respectively. In terms of predicting recurrence in NSCLC, our findings indicate that using ComBat harmonization can significantly enhance machine learning outcomes, particularly improving the accuracy of watershed segmentation, which initially had fewer reliable features than manual contouring. Following the application of ComBat harmonization, the majority of cases saw substantial increase in sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion Radiomic features are vulnerable to different segmentation methods. ComBat harmonization might be considered a solution to overcome the poor reliability of radiomic features.

Four scanners were used to acquire an MRI of a nonanatomic phantom as part of the TCIA RIDER database. In fast spin-echo inversion recovery (IR) sequences, several inversion durations were employed, including 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 ms. In addition, a 3D fast spoiled gradient recalled echo (FSPGR) sequence was used to investigate several flip angles (FA): 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees. Nineteen phantom compartments were manually segmented. Different approaches were used to pre-process each image: Bin discretization, Wavelet filter, Laplacian of Gaussian, logarithm, square, square root, and gradient. Overall, 92 first-, second-, and higher-order statistical radiomic features were extracted. ComBat harmonization was also applied to the extracted radiomic features. Finally, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Kruskal-Wallis’s (KW) tests were implemented to assess the robustness of radiomic features. The number of non-significant features in the KW test ranged between 0–5 and 29–74 for various scanners, 31–91 and 37–92 for three times tests, 0–33 to 34–90 for FAs, and 3–68 to 65–89 for IRs before and after ComBat harmonization, with different image pre-processing techniques, respectively. The number of features with ICC over 90% ranged between 0–8 and 6–60 for various scanners, 11–75 and 17–80 for three times tests, 3–83 to 9–84 for FAs, and 3–49 to 3–63 for IRs before and after ComBat harmonization, with different image pre-processing techniques, respectively. The use of various scanners, IRs, and FAs has a great impact on radiomic features. However, the majority of scanner-robust features is also robust to IR and FA. Among the effective parameters in MR images, several tests in one scanner have a negligible impact on radiomic features. Different scanners and acquisition parameters using various image pre-processing might affect radiomic features to a large extent. ComBat harmonization might significantly impact the reproducibility of MRI radiomic features.

However, its reliability has been a concern, possibly due to its high-dimensional nature. This study aims to quantitatively investigate the impact of randomly generated irrelevant features on MRI radiomics feature selection, modeling, and performance by progressively adding randomly generated features. Two multiparametric-MRI radiomics PC datasets were used (dataset 1 (n = 260), dataset 2 (n = 100)). The endpoint was to differentiate pathology-confirmed clinically significant (Gleason score (GS) ≥ 7) from insignificant (GS < 7) PC. Random features were generated at 12 levels with a 10% increment from 0% to 100% and an additional 5%. Three feature selection algorithms and two classifiers were used to build the models. The area under the curve and accuracy were used to evaluate the model’s performance. Feature importance was calculated to assess features’ contributions to the models. The metrics of each model were compared using an ANOVA test with a Bonferroni correction. A slight tendency to select more random features with the increasing number of random features introduced to the datasets was observed. However, the performance of the radiomics-built models was not significantly affected, which was partially due to the higher contribution of radiomics features toward the models compared to the random features. These reliability effects also vary among datasets. In conclusion, while the inclusion of additional random features may still slightly impact the performance of the feature selection, it may not have a substantial impact on the MRI radiomics model performance.",Diagnostics,,['JournalArticle'],1944b6e1-2c1d-4f42-88e3-9f8a52f57e47,Diagnostics,,13,Unknown,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,3,28,"Cindy Xue, Jing Yuan, Gladys G.

We aim to assess the potential of radiomic features in predicting the time-to-event OS of patients with GBM using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Materials and methods One hundred nineteen patients with GBM, who had T1-weighted contrast-enhanced and T2-FLAIR MRI sequences, along with clinical data and survival time, were enrolled. Image preprocessing methods included 64 bin discretization, Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filters with three Sigma values and eight variations of Wavelet Transform. Images were then segmented, followed by the extraction of 1212 radiomic features. Seven feature selection (FS) methods and six time-to-event ML algorithms were utilized. The combination of preprocessing, FS, and ML algorithms (12 × 7 × 6 = 504 models) was evaluated by multivariate analysis. Results Our multivariate analysis showed that the best prognostic FS/ML combinations are the Mutual Information (MI)/Cox Boost, MI/Generalized Linear Model Boosting (GLMB) and MI/Generalized Linear Model Network (GLMN), all of which were done via the LOG (Sigma = 1 mm) preprocessing method (C-index = 0.77). The LOG filter with Sigma = 1 mm preprocessing method, MI, GLMB and GLMN achieved significantly higher C-indices than other preprocessing, FS, and ML methods (all p values < 0.05, mean C-indices of 0.65, 0.70, and 0.64, respectively). Conclusion ML algorithms are capable of predicting the time-to-event OS of patients using MRI-based radiomic and clinical features. MRI-based radiomics analysis in combination with clinical variables might appear promising in assisting clinicians in the survival prediction of patients with GBM.

Specifically, we extracted radiomics features from multicenter computed tomography (CT) images to differentiate between the four histopathological subtypes of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In addition, the results that varied with the radiomics model were compared. We investigated the presence of the batch effects and the impact of feature harmonization on the models’ performance. Moreover, the question on how the training dataset composition influenced the selected feature subsets and, consequently, the model’s performance was also investigated. Therefore, through combining data from the two publicly available datasets, this study involves a total of 152 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 106 large cell carcinoma (LCC), 150 adenocarcinoma (ADC), and 58 no other specified (NOS). Through the matRadiomics tool, which is an example of Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) compliant software, 1781 radiomics features were extracted from each of the malignant lesions that were identified in CT images. After batch analysis and feature harmonization, which were based on the ComBat tool and were integrated in matRadiomics, the datasets (the harmonized and the non-harmonized) were given as an input to a machine learning modeling pipeline. The following steps were articulated: (i) training-set/test-set splitting (80/20); (ii) a Kruskal–Wallis analysis and LASSO linear regression for the feature selection; (iii) model training; (iv) a model validation and hyperparameter optimization; and (v) model testing. Model optimization consisted of a 5-fold cross-validated Bayesian optimization, repeated ten times (inner loop). The whole pipeline was repeated 10 times (outer loop) with six different machine learning classification algorithms. Moreover, the stability of the feature selection was evaluated. Results showed that the batch effects were present even if the voxels were resampled to an isotropic form and whether feature harmonization correctly removed them, even though the models’ performances decreased. Moreover, the results showed that a low accuracy (61.41%) was reached when differentiating between the four subtypes, even though a high average area under curve (AUC) was reached (0.831). Further, a NOS subtype was classified as almost completely correct (true positive rate ~90%). The accuracy increased (77.25%) when only the SCC and ADC subtypes were considered, as well as when a high AUC (0.821) was obtained—although harmonization decreased the accuracy to 58%. Moreover, the features that contributed the most to models’ performance were those extracted from wavelet decomposed and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filtered images and they belonged to the texture feature class.. In conclusion, we showed that our multicenter data were affected by batch effects, that they could significantly alter the models’ performance, and that feature harmonization correctly removed them. Although wavelet features seemed to be the most informative features, an absolute subset could not be identified since it changed depending on the training/testing splitting. Moreover, performance was influenced by the chosen dataset and by the machine learning methods, which could reach a high accuracy in binary classification tasks, but could underperform in multiclass problems. It is, therefore, essential that the scientific community propose a more systematic radiomics approach, focusing on multicenter studies, with clear and solid guidelines to facilitate the translation of radiomics to clinical practice.",Diagnostics,,['JournalArticle'],1944b6e1-2c1d-4f42-88e3-9f8a52f57e47,Diagnostics,,13,Unknown,2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,16,63,"G.

The images were resliced, resampled, and realigned. In the next step, tumors were segmented semi-automatically into subregions including whole tumor, edema region, core tumor, enhancing region, and necrotic region. A total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from each subregion. The data were divided randomly into training and testing sets. A deep learning-based data augmentation method (CTGAN) was implemented to synthesize 200 datasets. A total of 18 classifiers were used to distinguish two genotypes of grade 4 astrocytomas. The best discriminatory power was obtained from core tumor regions overlaid on post-contrast T1 using the K-best feature selection algorithm and a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier. Abstract This study aimed to investigate the potential of quantitative radiomic data extracted from conventional MR images in discriminating IDH-mutant grade 4 astrocytomas from IDH-wild-type glioblastomas (GBMs). A cohort of 57 treatment-naïve patients with IDH-mutant grade 4 astrocytomas (n = 23) and IDH-wild-type GBMs (n = 34) underwent anatomical imaging on a 3T MR system with standard parameters. Post-contrast T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images were co-registered. A semi-automatic segmentation approach was used to generate regions of interest (ROIs) from different tissue components of neoplasms. A total of 1050 radiomic features were extracted from each image. The data were split randomly into training and testing sets. A deep learning-based data augmentation method (CTGAN) was implemented to synthesize 200 datasets from the training sets. A total of 18 classifiers were used to distinguish two genotypes of grade 4 astrocytomas. From generated data using 80% training set, the best discriminatory power was obtained from core tumor regions overlaid on post-contrast T1 using the K-best feature selection algorithm and a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier (AUC = 0.93, accuracy = 0.92, sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.86, PR_AUC = 0.92). Similarly, high diagnostic performances were obtained from original and generated data using 50% and 30% training sets. Our findings suggest that conventional MR imaging-based radiomic features combined with machine/deep learning methods may be valuable in discriminating IDH-mutant grade 4 astrocytomas from IDH-wild-type GBMs.",Cancers,journal,['JournalArticle'],d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,15,N/A,2023,2023-02-01 00:00:00,15,59,"Seyyed Ali Hosseini, Elahe Hosseini, G.

Given the recent advances in light microscopy and the need for accurate and high-throughput analysis of cells, automated algorithms have been developed for segmenting and analyzing the cells in microscopy images. Nevertheless, accurate, generic and robust whole-cell segmentation is still a persisting need to precisely quantify its morphological properties, phenotypes and sub-cellular dynamics. We present a single-channel whole cell segmentation algorithm. We use markers that stain the whole cell, but with less staining in the nucleus, and without using a separate nuclear stain. We show the utility of our approach in microscopy images of cell cultures in a wide variety of conditions. Our algorithm uses a deep learning approach to learn and predict locations of the cells and their nuclei, and combines that with thresholding and watershed-based segmentation. We trained and validated our approach using different sets of images, containing cells stained with various markers and imaged at different magnifications. Our approach achieved a 86% similarity to ground truth segmentation when identifying and separating cells. The proposed algorithm is able to automatically segment cells from single channel images using a variety of markers and magnifications.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,,19,N/A,2018,2018-10-03 00:00:00,187,32,"Yousef Al-Kofahi, A.

Here, we present advances in segmentation algorithms and analytical tools for multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), a platform that enables iterative staining of over 60 antibodies on a single tissue section. These refinements have enabled a comprehensive analysis of tuft cell number, distribution, and protein expression profiles as a function of anatomical location and physiological perturbations. Based solely on DCLK1 immunoreactivity, tuft cell numbers were similar throughout the mouse small intestine and colon. However, multiple subsets of tuft cells were uncovered when protein coexpression signatures were examined, including two new intestinal tuft cell markers, Hopx and EGFR phosphotyrosine 1068. Furthermore, we identified dynamic changes in tuft cell number, composition, and protein expression associated with fasting and refeeding and after introduction of microbiota to germ-free mice.

We can reach pressures in the 100-TPa regime on the Hugoniot, or ∼500-GPa regime along a quasi-isentrope, allowing the sample under study to remain solid, at planetary interior pressures. We observe RT stabilization (i) at an ablation front; (ii) in the presence of a strongly radiative shock; and (iii) in a unique regime of quasi-isentropic, high pressure, solid-state material flow, where the material strength significantly affects the evolution of a hydrodynamically unstable interface. The Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability occurs at an interface between two fluids of differing density during an acceleration. These instabilities can occur in very diverse settings, from inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions over spatial scales of ∼10−3−10−1 cm (10–1,000 μm) to supernova explosions at spatial scales of ∼1012 cm and larger. We describe experiments and techniques for reducing (“stabilizing”) RT growth in high-energy density (HED) settings on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Three unique regimes of stabilization are described: (i) at an ablation front, (ii) behind a radiative shock, and (iii) due to material strength. For comparison, we also show results from nonstabilized “classical” RT instability evolution in HED regimes on the NIF. Examples from experiments on the NIF in each regime are given. These phenomena also occur in several astrophysical scenarios and planetary science [Drake R (2005) Plasma Phys Controlled Fusion 47:B419–B440; Dahl TW, Stevenson DJ (2010) Earth Planet Sci Lett 295:177–186].",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,journal,['JournalArticle'],bb95bf2e-8383-4748-bf9d-d6906d091085,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,18233 - 18238,116,N/A,2018,2018-06-26 00:00:00,98,70,"B.

It leverages the extraordinary data-fitting capacity of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) while preserving high interpretability and robustness by embedding widely applicable physical laws such as the law of mass action and the Arrhenius law. In this paper, we further developed Bayesian CRNN to not only reconstruct but also quantify the uncertainty of chemical kinetic models from data. Two methods, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and variational inference, were used to perform the Bayesian CRNN, with the latter mainly adopted for its speed. We demonstrated the capability of Bayesian CRNN in the kinetic uncertainty quantification of different types of chemical systems and discussed the importance of embedding physical laws in data-driven modeling. Finally, we discussed the adaptation of Bayesian CRNN for incomplete measurements and model mixing for global uncertainty quantification.","Physical Chemistry, Chemical Physics - PCCP",journal,['JournalArticle'],63ed87ae-e104-4cfe-91c9-eb1f2f9ed5b0,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,,,N/A,2023,2023-01-20 00:00:00,17,7,"Qiaofeng Li, Huaibo Chen, Benjamin C.

Despite this, coffee remains vulnerable to several plant diseases that may result in significant financial losses for the agricultural industry. Traditionally, plant diseases are detected by expert observation with the naked eye. Traditional methods for managing such diseases are arduous, time-consuming, and costly, especially when dealing with expansive territories. Using a model based on transfer learning and deep learning model, we present in this study a technique for classifying Robusta coffee leaf disease photos into healthy and unhealthy classes. The MobileNetV2 network serves as the model since its network design is simple. Therefore, it is likely that the suggested approach will be deployed further on mobile devices. In addition, the transfer learning and experimental learning paradigms. Because it is such a lightweight net, the MobileNetV2 system serves as the foundational model. Results on Robusta coffee leaf disease datasets indicate that the suggested technique can achieve a high level of accuracy, up to 99.93%. The accuracy of other architectures besides MobileNetV2 such as DenseNet169 is 99.74%, ResNet50 architecture is 99.41%, and InceptionResNetV2 architecture is 99.09%.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,N/A,2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,12,24,"Y.

Food image classification is a challenging problem, the solution of which can be of great benefit to many real-world applications such as nutrition and allergy estimation. Most of the previous studies proposed to use variations of convolutional neural networks to tackle the problem. However, due to the limited number of annotated food image datasets, there is still some room for improvement, especially in terms of accuracy and speed. Generally speaking, neural networks trained to solve image classification problems on a small dataset benefit from utilizing the weights of the networks that have been pre-trained on a large image classification dataset such as ImageNet. In this paper, we compare the trade-offs between training networks from scratch, deploying pre-trained networks as feature extractors, and fine-tuning the networks for Thai food image classification. By utilizing Transfer Learning with EfficientNetV1, we were able to achieve higher accuracy for Thai Food Image Classification on the largest publicly available Thai food image dataset, THFOOD-50. In particular, our proposed method improves upon the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art method from 84.06% to 91.49% while maintaining the speed for the prediction at 103 ms and 1205 ms for GPU and CPU, respectively.",Engineering Journal,journal,,363b13a4-48da-4c84-80db-f138f0e981a0,Engineering Journal,,,N/A,2022,2022-10-31 00:00:00,5,53,"Sirawit Ittisoponpisan, Chayanat Kaipan, Somporn Ruang-on, Rattayagon Thaiphan, Kritaphat Songsri-in","13394408, 2192457036, 2187087969, 51360797, 1412969516",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d97f2bc35be350d8c420bfcb32a6699f85a6d3a8,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science",13394408

To protect birds and the diversity of species on earth, it is urgent to build an automatic bird image recognition system. Therefore, this paper assesses the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning models on image recognition. Also, the help-ability of transfer learning in the field of image recognition is tested to evaluate the best model for bird recognition systems. Three groups of classifiers for bird recognition were constructed, namely, classifiers based on the traditional machine learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning-based convolutional neural networks. After experiments, these three classifiers showed significant differences in the classification effect on the Kaggle-180-birds dataset. The experimental results finally prove that deep learning is more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms in image recognition as the number of bird species increases. Besides, the obtained results show that when the sample data is small, transfer learning can help the deep neural network classifier to improve classification accuracy.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,N/A,2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,16,0,"Mohammed Alswaitti, Liao Zihao, Waleed Alomoush, Ayat Alrosan, Khalid A.

This could be solved through automatic identification and diagnoses using deep learning. However, this technology is not yet explored and examined in the case of peanut leaf spot disease due to some aspects, such as the availability of sufficient data to be used for training and testing the model. This study is intended to explore the use of pre-trained visual geometry group–16 (VGG16), visual geometry group–19 (VGG19), InceptionV3, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 architectures and deep learning optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Momentum, adaptive moment estimation (Adam), root mean square propagation (RMSProp), and adaptive gradient algorithm (Adagrad) in creating a model that can identify leaf spot disease by using a total of 1,000 images of leaves captured using a mobile camera. Confusion matrix was used to assess the accuracy and precision of the results. The result of the study shows that DenseNet-169 trained using SGD with momentum, Adam, and RMSProp attained the highest accuracy of 98%, while DenseNet-169 trained using RMSProp achieved the highest precision of 98% among pre-trained deep convolutional neural network architectures.

It has made a major contribution to medical image analysis as it overcomes the data scarcity problem as well as it saves time and hardware resources. However, transfer learning has been arbitrarily configured in the majority of studies. This review paper attempts to provide guidance for selecting a model and TL approaches for the medical image classification task. Methods 425 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from two databases, PubMed and Web of Science, published in English, up until December 31, 2020. Articles were assessed by two independent reviewers, with the aid of a third reviewer in the case of discrepancies. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for the paper selection and 121 studies were regarded as eligible for the scope of this review. We investigated articles focused on selecting backbone models and TL approaches including feature extractor, feature extractor hybrid, fine-tuning and fine-tuning from scratch. Results The majority of studies (n = 57) empirically evaluated multiple models followed by deep models (n = 33) and shallow (n = 24) models. Inception, one of the deep models, was the most employed in literature (n = 26). With respect to the TL, the majority of studies (n = 46) empirically benchmarked multiple approaches to identify the optimal configuration. The rest of the studies applied only a single approach for which feature extractor (n = 38) and fine-tuning from scratch (n = 27) were the two most favored approaches. Only a few studies applied feature extractor hybrid (n = 7) and fine-tuning (n = 3) with pretrained models. Conclusion The investigated studies demonstrated the efficacy of transfer learning despite the data scarcity. We encourage data scientists and practitioners to use deep models (e.g. ResNet or Inception) as feature extractors, which can save computational costs and time without degrading the predictive power.",BMC Medical Imaging,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",31319e83-8bcf-4d70-947d-f760d7c67d76,BMC Medical Imaging,,22,N/A,2022,2022-04-13 00:00:00,446,154,"Hee E.

This is often achieved through integration: IoT is being integrated into billions of intelligent objects, commonly labeled “things,” from which the service collects various forms of data regarding both these “things” themselves as well as their environment. While IoT and IoT-powered decices can provide invaluable services in various fields, unauthorized access and inadvertent modification are potential issues of tremendous concern. In this paper, we present a process for resolving such IoT issues using adapted long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN). With this method, we utilize specialized deep learning (DL) methods to detect abnormal and/or suspect behavior in IoT systems. LSTM RNNs are adopted in order to construct a high-accuracy model capable of detecting suspicious behavior based on a dataset of IoT sensors readings. The model is evaluated using the Intel Labs dataset as a test domain, performing four different tests, and using three criteria: F1, Accuracy, and time. The results obtained here demonstrate that the LSTM RNN model we create is capable of detecting abnormal behavior in IoT systems with high accuracy.",International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),journal,,79ca3e12-1e1d-4da8-9915-54a393e8c512,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,N/A,2022,2022-04-01 00:00:00,18,0,"M.

Net benefit is an increasingly reported decision analytic measure that puts benefits and harms on the same scale. This is achieved by specifying an exchange rate, a clinical judgment of the relative value of benefits (such as detecting a cancer) and harms (such as unnecessary biopsy) associated with models, markers, and tests. The exchange rate can be derived by asking simple questions, such as the maximum number of patients a doctor would recommend for biopsy to find one cancer. As the answers to these sorts of questions are subjective, it is possible to plot net benefit for a range of reasonable exchange rates in a “decision curve.” For clinical prediction models, the exchange rate is related to the probability threshold to determine whether a patient is classified as being positive or negative for a disease. Net benefit is useful for determining whether basing clinical decisions on a model, marker, or test would do more good than harm. This is in contrast to traditional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are statistical abstractions not directly informative about clinical value. Recent years have seen an increase in practical applications of net benefit analysis to research data. This is a welcome development, since decision analytic techniques are of particular value when the purpose of a model, marker, or test is to help doctors make better clinical decisions.",British medical journal,journal,['JournalArticle'],3048b449-a773-4256-9bb5-5e61fbb61e52,The BMJ,,352,N/A,2016,2016-01-25 00:00:00,749,22,"A.

As the thyroid gland controls human metabolism, thyroid illness is a matter of concern for human health. To save time and reduce error rates, an automatic, reliable, and accurate thyroid identification machine-learning (ML) system is essential. The proposed model aims to address existing work limitations such as the lack of detailed feature analysis, visualization, improvement in prediction accuracy, and reliability. Here, a public thyroid illness dataset containing 29 clinical features from the University of California, Irvine ML repository was used. The clinical features helped us to build an ML model that can predict thyroid illness by analyzing early symptoms and replacing the manual analysis of these attributes. Feature analysis and visualization facilitate an understanding of the role of features in thyroid prediction tasks. In addition, the overfitting problem was eliminated by 5-fold cross-validation and data balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Ensemble learning ensures prediction model reliability owing to the involvement of multiple classifiers in the prediction decisions. The proposed model achieved 99.5% accuracy, 99.39% sensitivity, and 99.59% specificity with the boosting method which is applicable to real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to ease diagnosis and promote early treatment.",Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction,,['JournalArticle'],472fe64a-ea91-4506-8d2d-4c9a9374e1ea,Mach.

Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, 3194 SPECT thyroid images were collected for model training (n=2067), internal validation (n=514) and external validation (n=613). First, four pretrained DCNN models (AlexNet, ShuffleNetV2, MobileNetV3 and ResNet-34) for were tested multiple medical image classification of thyroid disease types (i.e., Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, thyroid tumor and normal thyroid). The best performing model was then subjected to fivefold cross-validation to further assess its performance, and the diagnostic performance of this model was compared with that of junior and senior nuclear medicine physicians. Finally, class-specific attentional regions were visualized with attention heatmaps using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Results Each of the four pretrained neural networks attained an overall accuracy of more than 0.85 for the classification of SPECT thyroid images. The improved ResNet-34 model performed best, with an accuracy of 0.944. For the internal validation set, the ResNet-34 model showed higher accuracy (p < 0.001) when compared to that of the senior nuclear medicine physician, with an improvement of nearly 10%. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.931 for the external dataset, a significantly higher accuracy than that of the senior physician (0.931 vs. 0.868, p < 0.001). Conclusion The DCNN-based model performed well in terms of diagnosing thyroid scintillation images. The DCNN model showed higher sensitivity and greater specificity in identifying Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid tumors compared to those of nuclear medicine physicians, illustrating the feasibility of deep learning models to improve the diagnostic efficiency for assisting clinicians.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,journal,['JournalArticle'],baea33cc-0a71-4b2a-9f01-5071f7b1abc9,Frontiers in Endocrinology,,14,N/A,2023,2023-08-11 00:00:00,14,42,"Huayi Zhao, C.

As a result, early detection was pertinent in preventing or minimizing the impact of this disease. In this study, different machine learning (ML) algorithms with a combination of scaling method, oversampling technique, and various feature selection approaches have been applied to make an efficient framework to classify TD. In addition, significant risk factors of TD were also identified in this proposed system. The dataset was collected from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository for this research. After that, in the preprocessing stage, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to resolve the imbalance class problem and robust scaling technique was used to scale the dataset. The Boruta, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches were used to select appropriate features. To train the model, we employed six different ML classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). The models were examined using a 5-fold CV. Different performance metrics were observed to compare the effectiveness of the algorithms. The system achieved the most accurate results using the RF classifier, with 99% accuracy. This proposed system will be beneficial for physicians and patients to classify TD as well as to learn about the associated risk factors of TD.",Journal of Electrical Systems and Information Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],685223aa-7f1a-49ff-9af1-ed599887e9bf,Journal of Electrical Systems and Information Technology,1-23,10,N/A,2023,2023-06-16 00:00:00,19,104,"Azrin Sultana, Rakibul Islam","2219134119, 2125083219",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/296a215314611c1fd303a2392e804cc1dd0de235,"Computer Science, Medicine",2219134119

Thyroid disease is a severe medical complaint that could be developed by high Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels or an infection in the thyroid tissues. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are two critical conditions caused by insufficient thyroid hormone production and excessive thyroid hormone production, respectively. Machine learning models can be used to precisely process the data generated from different medical sectors and to build a model to predict several diseases. In this paper, we use different machine-learning algorithms to predict hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Moreover, we identified the most significant features, which can be used to detect thyroid diseases more precisely. After completing the pre-processing and feature selection steps, we applied our modified and original data to several classification models to predict thyroidism. We found Random Forest (RF) is giving the maximum evaluation score in all sectors in our dataset, and Naive Bayes is performing very poorly. Moreover selecting the feature by using the feature importance method RF provides the best accuracy of 91.42%, precision of 92%, recall of 92% and F1-score of 92%. Further, by analyzing the characteristics and behavior of the dataset, we identified the most important features (TSH, T3, TT4, and FTI) of the dataset. In terms of accuracy and other performance evaluation criteria, this study could advocate the use of effective classifiers and features backed by machine learning algorithms to detect and diagnose thyroid disease. Finally, we did some explainability analysis of our best classifier to understand the internal black-box of our machine learning model and datasets. This study could further pave the way for the researcher as well as healthcare professionals to analyze thyroid disease in real time applications.",Human-Centric Intelligent Systems,journal,['JournalArticle'],096a4eed-8279-4e94-abd3-1c0403372743,Human-Centric Intelligent Systems,211 - 231,3,N/A,2023,2023-06-08 00:00:00,13,45,"M.

In this context, early detection of diseases is the most common area of application. In this scenario, thyroid diseases are an example of illnesses that can be effectively faced if discovered quite early. Detecting thyroid diseases is crucial in order to treat patients effectively and promptly, by saving lives and reducing healthcare costs. This work aims at systematically reviewing and analyzing the literature on various artificial intelligence-related techniques applied to the detection and identification of various diseases related to the thyroid gland. The contributions we reviewed are classified according to different viewpoints and taxonomies in order to highlight pros and cons of the most recent research in the field. After a careful selection process, we selected and reviewed 72 papers, analyzing them according to three main research questions, i.e., which diseases of the thyroid gland are detected by different artificial intelligence techniques, which datasets are used to perform the aforementioned detection, and what types of data are used to perform the detection. The review demonstrates that the majority of the considered papers deal with supervised methods to detect hypo- and hyperthyroidism. The average accuracy of detection is high (96.84%), but the usage of private and outdated datasets with a majority of clinical data is very common. Finally, we discuss the outcomes of the systematic review, pointing out advantages, disadvantages, and future developments in the application of artificial intelligence for thyroid diseases detection.",PeerJ Computer Science,,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",138e58fc-8643-41c2-a92c-068ea4f4c607,PeerJ Computer Science,,9,Unknown,2023,2023-06-06 00:00:00,19,101,"L.

Traditional physical and chemical analysis methods for green plum acidity detection are destructive, time-consuming, and unable to achieve online detection. In response, a rapid and non-destructive detection method based on hyperspectral imaging technology was studied in this paper. Research on prediction performance comparisons between supervised learning methods and unsupervised learning methods is currently popular. To further improve the accuracy of component prediction, a new hyperspectral imaging system was developed, and the kernel principle component analysis—linear discriminant analysis—extreme gradient boosting algorithm (KPCA-LDA-XGB) model was proposed to predict the acidity of green plum. The KPCA-LDA-XGB model is a supervised learning model combined with the extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental results proved that the KPCA-LDA-XGB model offers good acidity predictions for green plum, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.829 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.107 for the prediction set. Compared with the basic XGBoost model, the KPCA-LDA-XGB model showed a 79.4% increase in R and a 31.2% decrease in RMSE. The use of linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial (Poly) kernel functions were also compared and analyzed in this paper to further optimize the KPCA-LDA-XGB model.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-01-30 00:00:00,22,22,"Yang Liu, Honghong Wang, Yeqi Fei, Ying Liu, Luxiang Shen, Zilong Zhuang, Xiao Zhang","2152798461, 2109566038, 2045203822, 2155355726, 2047977872, 123728233, 2115476556",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/034d860700ee788ff8d5513b5c6a80da66968b4a,"Agricultural and Food Sciences, Computer Science, Medicine",2152798461

However, for these large amounts of data, many common and cutting‐edge effective bioinformatics research methods still cannot be widely used. This has encouraged the establishment of many analytical platforms, a portion of databases or platforms were designed to solve the special analysis needs of users, for instance, MG RAST, IMG/M, Qiita, BIGSdb, and TRAPR were developed for specific omics research, and some databases or servers provide solutions for special problems solutions. Metascape was designed to only provide functional annotations of genes as well as function enrichment analysis; BioNumerics and RidomSeqSphere+ perform multilocus sequence typing; CARD provides only antimicrobial resistance annotations. Additionally, some web services are outdated, and inefficient interaction often fails to meet the needs of researchers, such as our previous versions of the platform. Therefore, the demand to complete massive data processing tasks urgently requires a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis platform. Hence, we have developed a website platform, Sangerbox 3.0 (http://vip.sangerbox.com/), a web‐based tool platform. On a user‐friendly interface that also supports differential analysis, the platform provides interactive customizable analysis tools, including various kinds of correlation analyses, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted correlation network analysis, and other common tools and functions, users only need to upload their own corresponding data into Sangerbox 3.0, select required parameters, submit, and wait for the results after the task has been completed. We have also established a new interactive plotting system that allows users to adjust the parameters in the image; moreover, optimized plotting performance enables users to adjust large‐capacity vector maps on the web site. At the same time, we have integrated GEO, TCGA, ICGC, and other databases and processed data in batches, greatly reducing the difficulty to obtain data and improving the efficiency of bioimformatics study for users. Finally, we also provide users with rich sources of bioinformatics analysis courses, offering a platform for researchers to share and exchange knowledge.",iMeta,,['JournalArticle'],033b2db2-7ddc-466e-ad41-adbf06e29ef3,iMeta,,1,Unknown,2022,2022-07-08 00:00:00,605,25,"Weitao Shen, Ziguang Song, Xiao Zhong, Mei Huang, Danting Shen, Pingping Gao, Xiaoqian Qian, Mengmeng Wang, Xiubin He, Tonglian Wang, Shuang Li, Xiangyuan Song","2149662145, 1785367067, 2113309268, 2175549323, 52211482, 2147233971, 5743381, 2175581044, 2175540259, 87679026, 2175859828, 2118944636",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fabff697cd0ec343490f89e8e6587200d97f378,"Biology, Computer Science, Medicine",2149662145

Unfortunately, 10%–40% of patients have primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy. TNF family genes play crucial roles in inflammation and immune regulation; however, the effects of TNF family genes on CD remain unclear. Methods CD expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Unsupervised clustering was then used to identify the gene subtypes in CD based on the expressions of TNF family genes. The features of the gene subtypes were characterized using functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses, and biomarkers of the gene subtypes were identified. Results Patients with CD were divided on the basis of unsupervised clustering into two gene subtypes: immune and metabolic. Gene subtype A was significantly correlated with leukocyte migration and cytokine interactions, whereas gene subtype B was associated with metabolic pathways. Whereas 89.5% of the patients in gene subtype B responded to infliximab, only 16.7% of patients in gene subtype A responded. In addition, a combination of interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), interleukin 6 (IL6), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) can effectively distinguish between gene subtypes A and B. Conclusion Comprehensive analyses of the TNF family genes may reveal the underlying pathogenesis of CD. The classification of subtypes may provide new ideas for the personalized treatment of patients with CD.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,13,N/A,2022,2022-04-22 00:00:00,4,34,"Chenglin Ye, Sizhe Zhu, Jingping Yuan","80080655, 2110018754, 2150063854",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03327d34c5a42b422a0ce9596f4ca6c7767f1425,Medicine,80080655

Validation of candidate biomarkers in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced experimental colitis model and ceRNA network in an HCT116 cell line was also an aim, along with purposing to reveal the pathogenesis of CD. Methods GSE102134 and GSE67106 datasets were obtained and used to screen the differentially expressed genes. WCGNA was applied to identify the relative model to construct the ceRNA network. Furthermore, the relationship between candidate gene and immune infiltration was investigated. Then, the expression of potential biomarkers was validated via qRT-PCR in a TNBS induced experimental colitis model. Finally, the ceRNA network was confirmed by RNAi experiments in an HCT116 cell line. Results The ceRNA network, consisting of four lncRNAs, four miRNAs, and eight mRNAs, was constructed and the ROC analysis showed four mRNAs (PTGS2, LPL, STAT1, and TRIB2) had high diagnostic accuracy (AUC>0.9). In addition, upregulated PTGS2 was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including Natural killer cells, exhausted T-cells, monocytes, and Dendritic cells. The outcome of this TNBS induced experimental colitis model verified that the expression of PTGS2 and mir-429 was consistent with results of previous bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the predicted ceRNA network MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 were validated via RNA interference. Knockout of MIR3142HG decreased the mRNA level of PTGS2, whereas inhibition of mir-429 increased the mRNA level of PTGS2 in the HCT116 cell line. Conclusion The exploration of the ceRNA network in this work might contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of CD. The constructed MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 ceRNA network may play a role in CD, and PTGS2 can be a potential immune-related biomarker in CD.",Journal of Inflammation Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],2264e13c-a38e-4a95-ad47-1fd698d3fc68,Journal of Inflammation Research,6447 - 6459,14,N/A,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,7,47,"Chenglin Ye, Sizhe Zhu, Jingping Yuan","80080655, 2110018754, 7998468",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a80c4f36fffb31d3ec222d31aba34a185d35e2d,"Biology, Medicine",80080655

Baseline β7 expression does not impact αE induction or gene expression in T cells. Phospho-SMAD3 is increased in inflamed mucosa in IBD. Targeting interactions between α4β7 integrin and endothelial adhesion molecule MAdCAM-1 to inhibit lymphocyte migration to the gastrointestinal tract is an effective therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Following lymphocyte entry into the mucosa, a subset of these cells expresses αEβ7 integrin, which is expressed on proinflammatory lymphocytes, to increase cell retention. The factors governing lymphocyte migration into the intestinal mucosa and αE integrin expression in healthy subjects and IBD patients remain incompletely understood. We evaluated changes in factors involved in lymphocyte migration and differentiation within tissues. Both ileal and colonic tissue from active IBD patients showed upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1 at the gene and protein levels compared with healthy subjects and/or inactive IBD patients. β1 and β7 integrin expression on circulating lymphocytes was similar across groups. TGF-β1 treatment induced expression of αE on both β7+ and β7− T cells, suggesting that cells entering the mucosa independently of MAdCAM-1/α4β7 can become αEβ7+. ITGAE gene polymorphisms did not alter protein induction following TGF-β1 stimulation. Increased phospho-SMAD3, which is directly downstream of TGF-β, and increased TGF-β–responsive gene expression were observed in the colonic mucosa of IBD patients. Finally, in vitro stimulation experiments showed that baseline β7 expression had little effect on cytokine, chemokine, transcription factor, and effector molecule gene expression in αE+ and αE− T cells. These findings suggest cell migration to the gut mucosa may be altered in IBD and α4β7−, and α4β7+ T cells may upregulate αEβ7 in response to TGF-β once within the gut mucosa.",Journal of Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3456d2d7-a9b4-495f-a7a0-a238096ee07a,The Journal of Immunology Author Choice,2245 - 2254,207,N/A,2021,2021-09-24 00:00:00,36,48,"M.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of CD, as indicated by the efficacy of anti-TNF-α therapy with infliximab (IFX). However, approximately 30–40% of CD patients fail to respond to IFX with still unclear underlying mechanisms. This study compares the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes from CD patients, who respond or non-respond to IFX. Under basal conditions, the mRNA for the cytokines TNFα, IL-23, IL-1β and the chemokines CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES and CCL2/MCP-1 was up-regulated in monocytes from non-responders than responders. The expression of the same cytokines and CCL2/MCP-1 was higher in non-responders also upon LPS treatment. Moreover, higher secretion of TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ and IL-2 proteins occurred in the supernatants of LPS-treated non-responders cells. Resistance to IFX in CD may result from a transcriptional dysregulation of circulating monocytes, leading to hyperactivation of pro-inflammatory pathways. Monocytes’ cytokine profile may thus represent a predictive marker of response to IFX. Monocytes were isolated from blood samples of 19 CD patients (11 responders, 8 non-responders) and incubated with or without LPS. Cytokine profiles were assessed by RT-qPCR and, in the supernatants, by ELISA assay.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,N/A,2020,2020-07-22 00:00:00,14,37,"F.

Nevertheless, it is unclear how gut glycosylation contributes to the HIV-associated microbial translocation and inflammation that persist despite viral suppression and contribute to the development of several comorbidities. We examined terminal ileum, right colon, and sigmoid colon biopsies from HIV-infected virally-suppressed individuals and found that gut glycomic patterns are associated with distinct microbial compositions and differential levels of chronic inflammation and HIV persistence. In particular, high levels of the pro-inflammatory hypo-sialylated T-antigen glycans and low levels of the anti-inflammatory fucosylated glycans were associated with higher abundance of glycan-degrading microbial species (in particular, Bacteroides vulgatus) , a less diverse microbiome, higher levels of inflammation, and higher levels of ileum-associated HIV DNA. These findings are linked to the activation of the inflammasome-mediating eIF2 signaling pathway. Our study thus provides the first proof-of-concept evidence that a previously unappreciated factor, gut glycosylation, is a force that may impact the vicious cycle between HIV infection, microbial translocation, and chronic inflammation.",Mucosal Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],592eea92-39cd-4609-a088-641ce5e32a13,Mucosal Immunology,753 - 766,13,N/A,2020,2020-03-09 00:00:00,24,103,"L.

It is becoming apparent that epigenetic factors are significantly associated with the development of the disease. DNA methylation remains the most studied epigenetic modification, and hypermethylation of gene promoters is associated with gene silencing. Methods DNA methylation alterations may contribute to the many complex diseases development by regulating the interplay between external and internal environmental factors and gene transcriptional expression. In this study, we used 15 tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), originally identified in colon cancer, to detect promoter methylation in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD). Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing analyses were performed to assess methylation level of TSGs in CD patients. Results We found 6 TSGs (sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP5, TFPI2, Sox17, and GATA4) are robustly hypermethylated in CD patient samples. Bisulfite sequencing analysis confirmed the methylation levels of the sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP5, TFPI2, Sox17, and GATA4 promoters in the representative CD patient samples. Conclusions In this study, the promoter hypermethylation of the TSGs observed indicates that CD exhibits specific DNA methylation signatures with potential clinical applications for the noninvasive diagnosis of IBD and the prognosis for patients with IBD.",Intestinal Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],02c07c77-4178-40dc-9078-33103ee6bbe7,Intestinal Research,297 - 305,18,N/A,2020,2020-02-07 00:00:00,11,61,"Tae-Oh Kim, Yu Kyeong Han, J.

No study has yet evaluated the effects of applying the water supply adjustment standard (Standard) and activating the reservoir emergency storage in response to extreme drought. The main objective is to assess the effects of applying Standard and activating emergency storage in meeting the water demand under extreme drought at six multipurpose reservoirs (Andong, Gimcheon-Buhang, Gunwi, Hapcheon, Imha, and Milyang) in the Nakdong River Basin, South Korea. We built a reservoir simulation model (HEC-ResSim), determined the extreme drought scenarios, and emergency storage capacity. We evaluated three reservoir operation cases (general operation, regular Standard, and revised Standard) from 2011 to 2100. The results show that applying the Standard and activating the emergency storage are effective in meeting the future water demand during extreme drought. In conclusion, we need to secure 110 million cubic meters (MCM) (Hapcheon reservoir) and 8 MCM (Gunwi reservoir) of water to reduce the number of days in the emergency stage. This research serves as a fundamental study that can help establish Standard and emergency storage activation criteria for other multipurpose reservoirs in preparation for extreme drought.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2022,2022-10-14 00:00:00,5,32,"Heechan Chae, J.

Machine-learning tools have the potential to improve groundwater prediction, thus enabling resource planners to: (1) anticipate water quality in unsampled areas or depth zones; (2) design targeted monitoring programs; (3) inform groundwater protection strategies; and (4) evaluate the sustainability of groundwater sources of drinking water. This paper proposes a machine-learning approach to groundwater prediction with the following characteristics: (i) the use of a regression-based approach to predict full groundwater images based on sequences of monthly groundwater maps; (ii) strategic automatic feature selection (both local and global features) using extreme gradient boosting; and (iii) the use of a multiplicity of machine-learning techniques (extreme gradient boosting, multivariate linear regression, random forests, multilayer perceptron and support vector regression). Of these techniques, support vector regression consistently performed best in terms of minimizing root mean square error and mean absolute error. Furthermore, including a global feature obtained from a Gaussian Mixture Model produced models with lower error than the best which could be obtained with local geographical features.",Algorithms,journal,['JournalArticle'],e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,300,13,N/A,2020,2020-11-17 00:00:00,67,66,"Eslam A.

The removal of barriers may be different for each country or region, as each differs greatly in terms of politics, economy and social and cultural awareness. This paper addresses the complex problem of removing dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs. We demonstrate the scales of the changes, including their major ecological, economic, and social impacts. Arguments and approaches to this problem vary across states and regions, depending on the political system, economy and culture, as confirmed by the qualitative and quantitative intensities of the dam removal process and its global geographical variation. The results indicate that the removal of dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs applies predominantly to smaller structures (< 2.5 m). The existing examples provide an important conclusion that dams and reservoirs should be considered with regard to the interrelations between people and the environment. Decisions to deconstruct hydraulic engineering structures (or, likewise, to construct them) have to be applied with scrutiny. Furthermore, all decision-making processes have to be consistent and unified and thus developed to improve the lack of strategies currently implemented across world.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,N/A,2020,2020-11-05 00:00:00,54,90,"M.

Left unnoticed and untreated, the deterioration in a health condition could even result in mortality. If it can be detected early, with proper treatment, undesirable outcomes can be avoided. Until now, the gold standard is the invasive way of measuring blood pressure (BP) using a catheter. Additionally, the cuff-based and noninvasive methods are too cumbersome or inconvenient for frequent measurement of BP. With the advancement of sensor technology, signal processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms, researchers are trying to find the perfect relationships between biomedical signals and changes in BP. This paper is a literature review of the studies conducted on the cuffless noninvasive measurement of BP using biomedical signals. Relevant articles were selected using specific criteria, then traditional techniques for BP measurement were discussed along with a motivation for cuffless measurement use of biomedical signals and machine learning algorithms. The review focused on the progression of different noninvasive cuffless techniques rather than comparing performance among different studies. The literature survey concluded that the use of deep learning proved to be the most accurate among all the cuffless measurement techniques. On the other side, this accuracy has several disadvantages, such as lack of interpretability, computationally extensive, standard validation protocol, and lack of collaboration with health professionals. Additionally, the continuing work by researchers is progressing with a potential solution for these challenges. Finally, future research directions have been provided to encounter the challenges.",Bioengineering,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",103075b0-1b66-4b69-9c47-f54875634fba,Bioengineering,,10,N/A,2022,2022-12-24 00:00:00,17,236,"M.

However, for conscious individuals, traditional cuff-based BP monitoring devices are often uncomfortable, intermittent, and impractical for frequent measurements. Continuous and non-invasive BP (NIBP) monitoring is currently gaining attention in the human health monitoring area due to its promising potentials in assessing the health status of an individual, enabled by machine learning (ML), for various purposes such as early prediction of disease and intervention treatment. This review presents the development of a non-invasive BP measuring tool called sphygmomanometer in brief, summarizes state-of-the-art NIBP sensors, and identifies extended works on continuous NIBP monitoring using commercial devices. Moreover, the NIBP predictive techniques including pulse arrival time, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, and ML are elaborated on the basis of bio-signals acquisition from these sensors. Additionally, the different BP values (systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure) of the various ML models adopted in several reported studies are compared in terms of the international validation standards developed by the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) for clinically-approved BP monitors. Finally, several challenges and possible solutions for the implementation and realization of continuous NIBP technology are addressed.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,27,118,"Siti Nor Ashikin Ismail, Nazrul Anuar, R.

Wearable cuffless BP devices offer potential solutions; however, little is known about their validity and utility. We aimed to systematically review the validity, features and clinical use of wearable cuffless BP devices. Methods and results We searched MEDLINE, Embase, IEEE Xplore and the Cochrane Database till December 2019 for studies that reported validating cuffless BP devices. We extracted information about study characteristics, device features, validation processes, and clinical applications. Devices were classified according to their functions and features. We defined devices with a mean systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) biases of <5 mmHg as valid as a consensus. Our definition of validity did not include assessment of device measurement precision, which is assessed by standard deviation of the mean difference—a critical component of ISO protocol validation criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 tool. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to summarise the mean biases for SBP and DBP across studies. Of the 430 studies identified, 16 studies (15 devices, 974 participants) were selected. The majority of devices (81.3%) used photoplethysmography to estimate BP against a reference device; other technologies included tonometry, auscultation and electrocardiogram. In addition to BP and heart rate, some devices also measured night-time BP (n = 5), sleep monitoring (n = 3), oxygen saturation (n = 3), temperature (n = 2) and electrocardiogram (n = 3). Eight devices showed mean biases of <5 mmHg for SBP and DBP compared with a reference device and three devices were commercially available. The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the wearable and reference devices for SBP (pooled mean difference = 3.42 mmHg, 95% CI: −2.17, 9.01, I2 95.4%) and DBP (pooled mean = 1.16 mmHg, 95% CI: −1.26, 3.58, I2 87.1%). Conclusion Several cuffless BP devices are currently available using different technologies, offering the potential for continuous BP monitoring. The variation in standards and validation protocols limited the comparability of findings across studies and the identification of the most accurate device. Challenges such as validation using standard protocols and in real-life settings must be overcome before they can be recommended for uptake into clinical practice.",European Heart Journal - Digital Health,Unknown,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",Unknown,European Heart Journal.

However, in practice, there is no universal FHE scheme that is effi-cient in all possible use cases. In this work, we show that FHE schemes suitable for arithmetic circuits (e.g. BGV or BFV) have a similar performance as FHE schemes for non-arithmetic circuits (TFHE) in basic comparison tasks such as less-than, maximum and minimum operations. Our implementation of the less-than function in the HElib library is up to 3 times faster than the prior work based on BGV/BFV.

b2ad6aa1ca5de19f532d9b0998abefd01da524b0,10.1515/popets-2016-0043,Privately Evaluating Decision Trees and Random Forests,"Abstract Decision trees and random forests are common classifiers with widespread use. In this paper, we develop two protocols for privately evaluating decision trees and random forests. We operate in the standard two-party setting where the server holds a model (either a tree or a forest), and the client holds an input (a feature vector). At the conclusion of the protocol, the client learns only the model’s output on its input and a few generic parameters concerning the model; the server learns nothing. The first protocol we develop provides security against semi-honest adversaries. We then give an extension of the semi-honest protocol that is robust against malicious adversaries. We implement both protocols and show that both variants are able to process trees with several hundred decision nodes in just a few seconds and a modest amount of bandwidth. Compared to previous semi-honest protocols for private decision tree evaluation, we demonstrate a tenfold improvement in computation and bandwidth.",IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,journal,['JournalArticle'],166fd2b5-a928-4a98-a449-3b90935cc101,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,335 - 355,2016,N/A,2016,2016-10-01 00:00:00,162,75,"David J.

This work demonstrates a new hollow core optical fiber based on a different guiding mechanism, which confines light with a cladding made of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material through total internal reflection. We show that the addition of a layer of ENZ material coating (e.g. indium tin oxide layer) significantly reduces the loss of the waveguide compared to the structure without the ENZ layer. We also show that the propagation loss of the ENZ hollow core fiber can be further improved by integrating ENZ materials with lower loss. This study presents a novel type of hollow core fiber, and can find advanced in-fiber photonic applications such as laser surgery/spectroscopy, novel gas-filled/discharge laser, in-fiber molecular/gas sensing, and low-latency optical fiber communication.",Nanophotonics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1025 - 1031,13,N/A,2024,2024-03-01 00:00:00,2,38,"Leon Zhang, Stuart Love, Aleksei Anopchenko, H.

Up until now, no discussion of phase transitions of nodal lines in photonic crystals using the Euler class has been reported, despite the fact that the Euler class and topological phase transition have recently been addressed in metallic or acoustic crystals. Here, we show how the deformation of a photonic crystal causes topological phase transitions in the nodal lines, and the Euler class can be used to theoretically predict the nodal lines’ stability based on the non-Abelian topological charge theory. Specifically, by manipulating the separation between the two single diamond structures and the extent of structural distortion, we numerically demonstrate the topological transition of nodal lines, e.g., from nodal lines to nodal rings. We then demonstrate that the range of surface states is strongly influenced by the topological phase transition of nodal lines. Moreover, the Zak phase was used to explain the surface states’ existence.",Nanophotonics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1079 - 1089,13,N/A,2024,2024-02-23 00:00:00,1,43,"Haedong Park, Alexander Jones, Minkyung Kim, S.

Despite remarkable progress, dynamically tunable metasurface holography in the visible band has rarely been reported due to limited available tuning methods. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate a thermally tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanofin based binary-phase metasurface, which generates holographic information in the visible varying with temperature. The insulator-to-metal phase transition in VO2 nanofins allows two independent binary-phase holograms generated by machine learning to be encoded in the respective phases of VO2 and switched under thermal regulation. By elaborately designing the dimensions and compensated phase of VO2 nanofins, high-quality images are reconstructed at corresponding temperatures under appropriate chiral illumination. In contrast, much poorer images are produced under inappropriate chiral illumination. We further demonstrate the advantage of applying the VO2 phase-compensated metasurface in high-security digital encryption, where two desired character combinations are read out with appropriate excitations and temperatures, whereas one identical fraudulent message is received with inappropriate excitations. Our design approach offers a new and efficient method to realize tunable metasurfaces, which is promisingly adopted in dynamic display, information encryption, optical anti-counterfeiting, etc.",Nanophotonics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1109 - 1117,13,N/A,2024,2024-02-21 00:00:00,14,46,"Yuan Liao, Yulong Fan, Dangyuan Lei","2287650011, 2252357288, 2124526207",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21004e072bc910d007350615765b2f6bf49ac5e8,"Engineering, Materials Science, Medicine, Physics",2287650011

To explore metamaterials with nanoscale topologies, interest in three-dimensional nanofabrication methods has grown and led to rapid production of target nanostructures over large areas. Additionally, inverse design methods have revolutionized materials science, enabling the optimization of microstructures and topologies to achieve the desired properties without extensive experimental cycles. This review highlights the recent progress in inverse design methods applied in proximity-field nanopatterning. It introduces novel approaches, such as adjoint methods and particle swarm optimization, to achieve target topologies and high-resolution nanostructures.

Instead of using the conventional approach that only the dipolar plasmonic mode is considered, we calculate the electric field enhancement in the nanometre sized gap, by taking account of the higher order modes in one gold sphere, which couples to the dipolar mode of the other sphere. The experimental confirmation is performed by gap-dependent tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) measurements. The photoluminescence and Raman enhancement are both observed with different growing trends as the gap width decreases. Red-shift of the background spectra is observed and implies the increasing coupling between the nanospheres. This analytic model is shown to be able to interpret the enhancement mechanisms underlying gap-dependent TERS experimental results.",Nanophotonics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1039 - 1047,13,N/A,2024,2024-02-02 00:00:00,1,80,"Yu-Ting Chen, Quan Liu, Felix Schneider, Marc Brecht, Alfred J.

This study aims to experimentally demonstrate ultrafast acousto-optic phenomena in the broad NIR spectral range of 0.77–1.1 eV (1130–1610 nm). Hundreds of GHz of light modulation are revealed in an all-optical configuration by combining ultrafast optical spectroscopy and light–sound conversion in 10–20 nm-thick bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) van der Waals thin films. The modified optical transition energy and the line shape in the NIR band indicate phonon–photon interactions, resulting in a modulation of optical characteristics by the photoexcited interlayer vibrations in Bi2Se3. This all-optical, ultrafast acousto-optic modulation approach may open avenues for next-generation nanophotonic applications, including optical communications and processing, due to the synergistic combination of large-area capability, high photo-responsivity, and frequency tunability in the NIR spectral range.",Nanophotonics,journal,['JournalArticle'],f925d1c5-6d57-49be-b903-c0ea27de720c,Nanophotonics,1059 - 1068,13,N/A,2024,2024-02-02 00:00:00,1,55,"Tae Gwan Park, Chaeyoon Kim, Eonseok Oh, Hong Ryeol Na, Seung-Hyun Chun, Sunghun Lee, Fabian Rotermund","50383138, 2189082283, 102450411, 1658083457, 2237902493, 2237941665, 2237844352",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c600818b4108089e57e391c8f8e467bc88de7741,"Medicine, Physics",50383138

To achieve this, advanced components such as high-performance intensity/phase modulators, waveguides, multiplexers, splitters, combiners, and filters operating in terahertz (THz) regime, specifically within the frequency range of 0.1–1 THz, are essential. However, existing microwave equipment and vector network analyzers designed for this frequency range suffer from limitations in resolution, stability, and accuracy when evaluating the intensity and phase responses of critical 6G THz devices. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the critical device requirements and emerging trends in next-generation 6G communication, essential performance evaluation parameters, comparisons between microwave and nano/microphotonic devices for testing, and the application of high-resolution THz sensors in 6G Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios. Notably, a frequency comb in the photonic regime emerges as the prime candidate for achieving precision evaluations of 6G networks and devices. Consequently, this review highlights the latest research in frequency comb measurements in the 6G THz frequency regime, with a particular emphasis on nano/microphotonic devices and metamaterials.

However, the characteristics of the interface of the lateral heterostructure, determining the electronic band structure and alignment at the heterojunction region, have rarely been studied due to the limited spatial resolution of nondestructive analysis systems. In this study, we investigated the confined phonons resulting from the phonon-disorder scattering process involving multiple disorders at the lateral heterostructure interface of MoS2–WS2 to prove the consequences of disorder-mediated deformation in the band structure. Moreover, we directly observed variations in the metal composition of the multi-disordered nanoscale alloy Mo1−x W x S2, consisting of atomic vacancies, crystal edges, and distinct nanocrystallites. Our findings through tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) imply that a tens of nanometer area of continuous TMDs alloy forms the multi-disordered interface of the lateral heterostructure.

Compared to its popular predecessor GMTKN30 [Goerigk and Grimme J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2011, 7, 291], it allows assessment across a larger variety of chemical problems-with 13 new benchmark sets being presented for the first time-and it also provides reference values of significantly higher quality for most sets. GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community via a dedicated website. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of better reference values, and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems, including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are ωB97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and ωB97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies.","Physical Chemistry, Chemical Physics - PCCP",journal,['JournalArticle'],63ed87ae-e104-4cfe-91c9-eb1f2f9ed5b0,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,"

The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes’ demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons. Methods We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy. Results The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p < 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.50). Conclusions These results suggest that cultures of concussion non-disclosure can develop in any population where disclosure is perceived as having undesirable consequences, not just athletic populations. Concussion researchers and practitioners should devote more attention to the perceived cost-benefit structures that create concussion non-disclosure to address this crucial public health issue more effectively.",PLoS ONE,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,14,N/A,2019,2019-05-01 00:00:00,33,55,"C.

A condition assessment framework that utilizes AI and sensor data is an important part of such an autonomous control system. A nuclear power plant has various structures, systems, and components (SSCs) such as piping-equipment that carries coolant to the reactor. Piping systems can degrade over time because of flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion. Any cracks and leakages can cause loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The current industry standards for conducting maintenance of vital SSCs can be time and cost-intensive. AI can play a greater role in the condition assessment and can be extended to recognize concrete degradation (chloride-induced damage and alkali–silica reaction) before cracks develop. This paper reviews developments in condition assessment and AI applications of structural and mechanical systems. The applicability of existing techniques to nuclear systems is somewhat limited because its response requires characterization of high and low-frequency vibration modes, whereas previous studies focus on systems where a single vibration mode can define the degraded state. Data assimilation and storage is another challenging aspect of autonomous control. Advances in AI and data mining world can help to address these challenges.",Energies,journal,['Review'],1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,18,180,"H.

In recent years however, synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SRμCT) has become a tool for extending the imaging of two-dimensional thin sections into three-dimensional imaging of tissue blocks, enabling so-called virtual histology with arbitrary clipping planes, volumetric rendering and automatic segmentation. In this study, we present a thorough characterization of human carotid plaques after endarterectomy of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), investigating several different pathologic structures using both SRμCT and histology. Phase-contrast SRμCT was performed with two different magnifications (voxel sizes 6.5 μm and 0.65 μm, respectively), and histology was performed with multiple different stainings (Alpha-actin, Glycophorin A, von Kossa, Movat, CD68). The 0.65 μm high-resolution SRμCT was performed on selected areas with plaque typical relevant morphology, identified on the 6.5 μm low-resolution SRμCT. The tomography datasets were reconstructed with additional 3D volume rendering and compared to histology. In total, nine different regions with typical pathologic structures were identified and imaged with high-resolution SRμCT. The results show many characteristics typical for advanced atherosclerotic plaques, clinically relevant, namely ruptures with thrombosis, neo-vascularization, inflammatory infiltrates in shoulder regions, lipid rich necrotic cores (LRNC), thin fibrous cap, calcifications, lumen irregularities, and changes in vessel wall structures such as the internal elastic membrane. This method’s non-destructive nature renders details of micro-structures with an excellent visual likeness to histology, with the additional strength of multiplanar and 3D visualization and the possibility of multiple re-scans.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,17,N/A,2022,2022-04-26 00:00:00,4,24,"My Truong, T.

Visualization of such small structures in vivo with high spatial resolution is an unsolved issue. The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) in the determination of atherosclerotic plaques with calcifications by validating this technique with micro-computer tomography (micro-CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The fibrocalcific plaques were obtained from 12 different patients and initially examined with micro-CT. The images exhibited calcifications within these plaques. For imaging with SAM, approximately 5 μm thick slices were prepared. Sound speed values within calcified regions were measured to be greater than the ones in collagen-rich regions. These fibrocalcific plaques were also examined with SEM and EDS revealing collagen and calcium deposition within these samples. The consistency of the results obtained by all of the modalities involved in our study is an indication of the potential of SAM as a clinical tool for the diagnosis of vulnerable plaques.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,9,N/A,2019,2019-01-24 00:00:00,14,45,"B.

In this regard, drones are one promising alternative to be used as delivery agents. However, security and Quality of Service (QoS) are major concerns while making use of drones for deliveries. In order to secure the drone communication system, we propose, CovaDel: a blockchain-based scheme to secure data transactions for the drone delivery use case that works in a phased manner. The proposed scheme make use of decoupled blockchain architecture to overcome the limited resources capabilities of drones to perform blockchain-based computations. Further, to ensure the QoS adherence, we also propose a QoS-aware communication approach that handles collisions and congestion on the basis of firefly algorithm’s attractiveness parameter (light intensity) received by the drones. Results obtained using a simulated environment verify the efficacy of the proposed scheme on the basis of gas consumed, transaction time, average network throughput, and delay.",Computing,journal,['JournalArticle'],48433268-b689-457a-8e57-36895fd4f04e,Computing,1589 - 1613,104,N/A,2022,2022-03-14 00:00:00,7,39,"Maninderpal Singh, G.

Most beers are produced in modern and technologically advanced breweries that use high quality raw materials, thus resulting in minor differences of physical–chemical properties between various beers (of the same style). However, consumers focus on constant quality and sensory properties of their chosen beer. Sensory evaluation is not an easy task and involves flexible methods for determination of differences and changes between beers. It is commonly used in breweries to provide constant quality of finished products, but also to ensure the quality of different raw materials (water, malt, hops) and to minimize the influence of the production process on final quality of beer.",Beverages,,,8f17045e-30f6-4ca1-ae5f-2b261bef44c2,Beverages,,,Unknown,2022,2022-03-02 00:00:00,7,24,"Kristina Habschied, Vinko Krstanović, K.

A human taste panel was conducted to assess the potential of infant formula milk (Aptamil® 1) to mask the taste of two model WHO priority medicines, zinc sulfate and paracetamol, manufactured as dispersible tablets. Simultaneously, the palatability of powder blends of the tablet platforms was assessed. Twenty healthy adult volunteers performed a swirl-and-spit assessment of placebos and API-containing blends in either a lactose-based or a mannitol-based dispersible tablet platform, reconstituted in 10 mL of either water or Aptamil® 1. Eighteen samples were rated for aversion using a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale, grittiness using a 5-point Likert scale, and “acceptability-as-a-medicine” evaluated as: “Would you find this sample acceptable to swallow as a medicine?” with binary answers of Yes/No. The API-containing formulations were more aversive than the placebos; the paracetamol-containing samples being more aversive than zinc sulfate samples. The platforms themselves were not aversive. Non-gritty samples had four-fold greater odds of being acceptable as a medicine. Aptamil® 1 masked the taste of zinc sulfate in the mannitol-based formulation but did not mask the taste of paracetamol in either platform, suggesting a limited taste-masking ability, which may be API and formulation dependent.",Pharmaceutics,journal,['JournalArticle'],3c77be64-fcd3-444d-a98d-f563ab841a7e,Pharmaceutics,,14,N/A,2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,4,47,"Samuel E.

In order to solve these problems, hot-melt extrusion (HME) was used to prepare azithromycin amorphous solid dispersion. Preliminary selection of a polymer for HME was conducted by calculating Hansen solubility parameter to predict the miscibility of the drug and polymer. Eudragit® RL PO was chosen as the polymer due to its combination of taste-masking effect and dissolution. Moreover, the solubility was improved with this polymer. Design of experiments (DoE) was used to optimize the formulation and process, with screw speed, extrusion temperature, and drug percentage as independent variables, and content, dissolution, and extrudates diameter as dependent variables. The optimal extrusion parameters were obtained as follows: temperature—150 °C; screw speed—75 rpm; and drug percentage—25%. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) studies of the powdered solid dispersions showed that the crystalline AZI transformed into the amorphous form. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicated that the formation of a hydrogen bond between AZI and the polymer led to the stabilization of AZI in its amorphous form. In conclusion, this work illustrated the importance of HME for the preparation of amorphous solid dispersion of AZI, which can solve the problems of bitterness and low solubility. It is also of great significance for the development of compliant pediatric AZI preparation.",Polymers,journal,['JournalArticle'],4efb9ad7-9740-4922-b9c8-c29376ca2223,Polymers,,14,N/A,2022,2022-01-26 00:00:00,24,36,"Jiale Li, Conghui Li, Hui Zhang, Xiang Gao, Ting Wang, Zengming Wang, Aiping Zheng","2155413315, 2144205696, 46702501, 2149396613, 2155392574, 1517728183, 2879031",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ceb7fb7ce156ff5e1aa2f137d4e66fc830d9672,"Chemistry, Materials Science, Medicine",2155413315

In this study, we will create normative values for the “Taste Strips” in children. This cross-sectional study included 609 children aged 6–15 years. “Taste Strips” were used to determine sweet, sour, salty, and bitter taste scores by a non-forced procedure. The 10th percentile was used to distinguish normal taste function from a reduced sense of taste. Multivariable generalized linear models (GLM) were estimated to study the effect of age (group), sex, and 6‐n‐propylthiouracil (PROP) status on taste function. Taste function changed with age, allowing for a distinction of three age groups: (I) 6–7 years, (II) 8–9 years, and (III) 10–15 years. Normative values were created for the age groups and boys and girls separately. Additionally, GLM showed a significant effect of (1) age (group) on sweet, salty, bitter, and total taste scores; (2) sex on sweet, sour, and total taste scores; and (3) PROP status on total taste scores. This study provided normative values for the “Taste Strips” in children, highlighting age- and sex-related differences. Taste dysfunction can be harmful and impacts quality of life, a topic that became increasingly important since the COVID-19 pandemic. Although taste dysfunction is thought to be rare in childhood, the detrimental impact of such dysfunction might be large, as children’s eating habits are strongly influenced by input from the chemical senses. Measuring taste function may elucidate the relationship between taste dysfunction and disease, fostering the development of more appropriate supportive strategies. However, adequate tools are lacking for children. Normative values of the “Taste Strips” are now available for children, which bolster the clinical utility of this test.

Children are extremely sensitive to drug tastes, and their compliance is especially poor with bitter medicine. Therefore, judging whether a drug is bitter and adopting flavor correction and taste-masking strategies are key to solving the problem of drug compliance in children. Although various machine learning models for bitterness and sweetness prediction have been reported in the literature, no learning model or bitterness database for children's medication has yet been reported. In this study, we trained four different machine learning models to predict bitterness. The goal of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning model called the ""Children's Bitter Drug Prediction System'' (CBDPS) based on Tkinter, which predicts the bitterness of a medicine based on its chemical structure. Users can enter the Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) formula for a single compound or multiple compounds, and CBDPS will predict the bitterness of children's medicines made from those XGBoost-Molecular ACCess System (XgBoost-MACCS) model yielded an accuracy of 88% under cross-validation.",Chemical and pharmaceutical bulletin,journal,['JournalArticle'],d963b61b-99d2-48fc-b99a-cd2e6d8e6f6f,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,,,N/A,2021,2021-08-21 00:00:00,5,2,"Guoliang Bai, Tiantian Wu, Libo Zhao, Xiaoling Wang, Shan Li, X.

Since the number of known protein sequences currently increases much faster than the number of known protein structures, and is likely to continue to do so in the foreseeable future, reliable ab initio protein structure prediction, without recourse to templates, would be highly desirable. It is currently not possible to achieve sufficient sampling in unrestrained folding to achieve predictions close to the native structure. Recently, very important progress has been made on the restricted problem of predicting spatial amino acid contacts in proteins from many homologous sequences [2]. While it is not yet clear if these techniques, collectively known as direct coupling analysis (DCA), can be leveraged to systematically predict full protein structures, preliminary results indicate that this may be the case [3,4]. DCA has also been used with success for several related problems, such as predicting structures of protein complexes [4] or alternative protein conformations [5]. 
 
The central ingredient in DCA is to learn generative probabilistic models from a set of homologous protein sequences. These models are chosen from an exponential family with linear and quadratic interactions, commonly referred to as Potts models (see Eq 1) [6]. In the literature, this procedure has been motivated by maximum entropy arguments [7–10]. In this Perspective, I will point out that these arguments are mistaken and that the successes of DCA can have nothing to do with maximum entropy. To the contrary, maximum entropy hides the real nature and questions raised by DCA and is thus an obstacle to progress. In addition, maximum entropy has a long and contested history in statistical physics, the field in which it was first introduced [11,12]. Definite and precise results derived in the last decade and a half have here conclusively falsified maximum entropy. Appeals to maximum entropy are therefore prejudicial to a more general acceptance and adoption of DCA.",PLoS Comput.

Arguably the most significant of these changes is that Pfam is now primarily based on the UniProtKB reference proteomes, with the counts of matched sequences and species reported on the website restricted to this smaller set. Building families on reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the website, whilst still providing access to many important model organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however, still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB sequences can still be retrieved. Some Pfam entries (1.6%) which have no matches to reference proteomes remain; we are working with UniProt to see if sequences from them can be incorporated into reference proteomes. Pfam-B, the automatically-generated supplement to Pfam, has been removed. The current release (Pfam 29.0) includes 16 295 entries and 559 clans.

To extend the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta-predictor (MetaPSICOV) which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence alignments, considers a broad range of other sequence-derived features and, uniquely, a range of metrics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues. Results: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range contacts—around 60% higher than PSICOV, and around 40% better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range hydrogen bonding, MetaPSICOV-HB achieves a precision of 0.69 for the top-L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 for the baseline MetaPSICOV.

However, these approaches do not consider the fact that the contacts in a protein are neither randomly, nor independently distributed, but actually follow precise rules governed by the structure of the protein and thus are interdependent. Here, we present PconsC2, a novel method that uses a deep learning approach to identify protein-like contact patterns to improve contact predictions. A substantial enhancement can be seen for all contacts independently on the number of aligned sequences, residue separation or secondary structure type, but is largest for β-sheet containing proteins. In addition to being superior to earlier methods based on statistical inferences, in comparison to state of the art methods using machine learning, PconsC2 is superior for families with more than 100 effective sequence homologs.

The key was to apply statistical methods that can distinguish direct couplings between pairs of columns in a multiple sequence alignment from merely correlated pairs, i.e. to separate direct from indirect effects. Two classes of such methods exist, either relying on regularized inversion of the covariance matrix or on pseudo-likelihood maximization (PLM). Although PLM-based methods offer clearly higher precision, available tools are not sufficiently optimized and are written in interpreted languages that introduce additional overheads. This impedes the runtime and large-scale contact prediction for larger protein families, multi-domain proteins and protein–protein interactions. Results: Here we introduce CCMpred, our performance-optimized PLM implementation in C and CUDA C. Using graphics cards in the price range of current six-core processors, CCMpred can predict contacts for typical alignments 35–113 times faster and with the same precision as the most accurate published methods. For users without a CUDA-capable graphics card, CCMpred can also run in a CPU mode that is still 4–14 times faster. Thanks to our speed-ups (http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/speed-up) contacts for typical protein families can be predicted in 15–60 s on a consumer-grade GPU and 1–6 min on a six-core CPU.

Our method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein structure and function from sequence information alone. Recently, global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature of the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires exponential time in the protein length, and efficient approximations are needed for practical applicability. Here we propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian modeling approach as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete amino-acid variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The resulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and exactly solvable. We show that the quality of inference is comparable or superior to the one achieved by mean-field approximations to inference with discrete variables, as done by direct-coupling analysis. This is true for (i) the prediction of residue-residue contacts in proteins, and (ii) the identification of protein-protein interaction partner in bacterial signal transduction.

Accumulating evidence shows that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play a key role in the immune responses to sepsis. Nevertheless, the effects of HLA genes in sepsis have still not been comprehensively understood. Methods: A systematical search was performed in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases from inception to 10 September 2021. Random forest (RF) and modified Lasso penalized regression were conducted to identify hub genes in multi-transcriptome data, thus we constructed a prediction model, namely the HLA classifier. ArrayExpress databases, as external validation, were utilized to evaluate its diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive performance. Immune cell infiltration score was calculated via CIBERSORTx tools and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and ssGSEA were conducted to determine the pathways that are significantly enriched in different subgroups. Next, we systematically correlated the HLA classifier with immunological characteristics from multiple perspectives, such as immune-related cell infiltration, pivotal molecular pathways, and cytokine expression. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate the expression level of HLA genes in clinical samples. Results: A total of nine datasets comprising 1,251 patients were included. Based on RF and modified Lasso penalized regression in multi-transcriptome datasets, five HLA genes (B2M, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2) were identified as hub genes, which were used to construct an HLA classifier. In the discovery cohort, the HLA classifier exhibited superior diagnostic value (AUC = 0.997) and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.716) than clinical characteristics or endotypes. Encouragingly, similar results were observed in the ArrayExpress databases. In the E-MTAB-7581 dataset, the use of hydrocortisone in the HLA high-risk subgroup (OR: 2.84, 95% CI 1.07–7.57, p = 0.037) was associated with increased risk of mortality, but not in the HLA low-risk subgroup. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis by CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA revealed that B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and infiltrating lymphocytes (ILs) were significantly richer in HLA low-risk phenotypes, while Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were more abundant in HLA high-risk phenotypes. The HLA classifier was significantly negatively correlated with B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and ILs, yet was significantly positively correlated with Tregs and MDSCs. Subsequently, molecular pathways analysis uncovered that cytokine-cytokine receptor (CCR) interaction, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and antigen-presenting cell (APC) co-stimulation were significantly enriched in HLA low-risk endotypes, which was significantly negatively correlated with the HLA classifier in multi-transcriptome data. Finally, the expression levels of several cytokines (IL-10, IFNG, TNF) were significantly different between the HLA subgroups, and the ratio of IL-10/TNF was significantly positively correlated with HLA score in multi-transcriptome data.

Coagulation is a key component of innate immunity since it prevents bacterial dissemination and can provoke inflammation. The term immunothrombosis describes the process by which the innate immune response drives aberrant coagulation, which can result in a lethal condition termed disseminated intravascular coagulation, often seen in sepsis. In this review, we describe the recently uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying inflammasome‐ and STING‐driven immunothrombosis induced by bacterial and viral infections, culminating in tissue factor (TF) activation and release. Current anticoagulant therapeutics, while effective, are associated with a life‐threatening bleeding risk, requiring the urgent development of new treatments. Targeting immunothrombosis may provide a safer option. Thus, we highlight preclinical tools which target TF and/or block canonical (NLRP3) or noncanonical (caspase‐11) inflammasome activation as well as STING‐driven TF release and discuss clinically approved drugs which block key immunothrombotic processes and, therefore, may be redeployed as safer anticoagulants.",European Journal of Immunology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",4bd4c659-7597-4156-bae1-ab3e8fba3fe5,European Journal of Immunology,1024 - 1034,52,N/A,2022,2022-05-15 00:00:00,19,139,"Tristram A.

Concurrently, conspiracy beliefs regarding the origin and spread of the disease have become widespread. Engaging in such beliefs can be explained as a form of coping in order to deal with elevated levels of stress. The present study investigated the indirect effects of coping strategies in the association between perceived chronic stress and COVID-related conspiracy beliefs. We report data from an online survey (N = 1,354 individuals: 807 female; 508 male; 8 diverse; 6 not specified; mean age 39.14 years) in German-speaking countries collected between January and March 2021. Our results indicate that people who felt more stressed were more prone to conspiracy beliefs. Coping via acceptance and self-blame was associated with decreased tendencies towards COVID-related conspiracy beliefs, while people who used denial as a strategy were more prone to these beliefs. These findings emphasize the need for stress management interventions and effective coping strategies during times of crisis in order to reduce chronic perceived stress, promote adaptive coping, and ultimately reduce conspiracy beliefs.",Current psychology,Unknown,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",Unknown,"Current Psychology (New Brunswick, N.j.)",1 - 9,,Unknown,2022,2022-08-16 00:00:00,11,35,"Bettina Pfeffer, Andreas Goreis, Adelais Reichmann, Ines Bauda, Diana Klinger, Mercedes M Bock, P.

The Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies that had been published in English and focused on children and young people between 0 and 24 years of age. This identified 21 studies from 11 countries, covering more than 96,000 subjects from 3 to 24 years of age. Pre-pandemic and pandemic data were compared. Most studies reported longitudinal deterioration in the mental health of adolescents and young people, with increased depression, anxiety and psychological distress after the pandemic started. Other findings included deteriorated negative affect, mental well-being and increased loneliness. Comparing data for pandemic and pre-pandemic periods showed that the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the mental health of children and young people.

The Relationship Between Conspiracy Thinking and the Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Adult Poles,"The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic, tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms among the surveyed Poles. The study was conducted via the Internet in a group of 700 people aged 24.8 ± 6.3 years (mean ± SD). 585 females and 110 males were involved. Scales such as Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the original questionnaire COVID-19 Conspiratorial Beliefs Scale (COVID-19 CBS) designed to measure the tendency to believe in false information about COVID-19 pandemic were used. A positive correlation was observed between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 CBS) and the tendency to believe in general conspiracy theories (GCBS) (r = 0.768; p < 0.001). Moreover, both COVID-19 CBS and GCBS positively correlated with the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study group. For COVID-19 CBS, the correlation coefficients were 0.087 (p < 0.021) and.108 (p < 0.004) for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, while for GCBS the coefficients were 0.132 (p < 0.001) and 0.147 (p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the increased tendency to believe in false beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in the severity of anxiety (b = 0.04; p = 0.021) and depression (b = 0.06; p < 0.001) symptoms.

01bf75c26b238aea72231f9224f6dbff450c0e7e,10.1613/jair.816,An Analysis of Reduced Error Pruning,"Top-down induction of decision trees has been observed to suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase. In particular, it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows linearly with the sample size, even though the accuracy of the tree does not improve. Reduced Error Pruning is an algorithm that has been used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems of decision tree learning. 
 
In this paper we present analyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three different settings. First we study the basic algorithmic properties of the method, properties that hold independent of the input decision tree and pruning examples. Then we examine a situation that intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be replaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute values of the pruning examples are independent of each other. This analysis is conducted under two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis we assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This assumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do not receive any pruning examples. 
 
This paper clarifies the different variants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its algorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis.",Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],aef12dca-60a0-4ca3-819b-cad26d309d4e,J.

The traditional approach of leveraging physical measurements for detecting cyber-induced physical contingencies is insufficient to reflect the accurate cyber-physical states. Moreover, deploying conventional rule-based and anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for cyberattack detection results in higher false positives. Hence, independent usage of detection tools of cyberattacks in cyber and physical sides has a limited capability. In this work, a mechanism to fuse real-time data from cyber and physical domains, to improve situational awareness of the whole system is developed. It is demonstrated how improved situational awareness can help reduce false positives in intrusion detection. This cyber and physical data fusion results in cyber-physical state space explosion which is addressed using different feature transformation and selection techniques. Our fusion engine is further integrated into a cyber-physical power system testbed as an application that collects cyber and power system telemetry from multiple sensors emulating real-world data sources found in a utility. These are synthesized into features for algorithms to detect cyber intrusions. Results are presented using the proposed data fusion application to infer False Data and Command Injection (FDI and FCI)-based Man-in-The-Middle attacks. Post collection, the data fusion application uses time-synchronized merge and extracts features. This is followed by pre-processing such as imputation, categorical encoding, and feature reduction, before training supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning models to evaluate the performance of the intrusion detection system. A major finding is the improvement of detection accuracy by fusion of features from cyber, security, and physical domains. Additionally, it is observed that the semi-supervised co-training technique performs at par with supervised learning methods with the proposed feature vector. The approach and toolset, as well as the dataset that is generated can be utilized to prevent threats such as false data or command injection attacks from being carried out by identifying cyber intrusions accurately.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,119118-119138,9,N/A,2021,2021-01-18 00:00:00,61,105,"Abhijeet Sahu, Zeyu Mao, Patrick Wlazlo, Hao Huang, K.

Machine learning (ML) is a computational method particularly suited to the establishment of predictive models of drug response based on genomic profiles of targeted cells. We report here on the application of our previously established open-source support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm to predict the responses of 175 individual cancer patients to a variety of standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs from the gene-expression profiles (RNA-seq or microarray) of individual patient tumors. The models were found to predict patient responses with >80% accuracy. The high PPV of our algorithms across multiple drugs suggests a potential clinical utility of our approach, particularly with respect to the identification of promising second-line treatments for patients failing standard-of-care first-line therapies.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,8,N/A,2018,2018-11-06 00:00:00,113,0,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ad808911a71a70c96b58a4ec545e7b0f8811f67,"Computer Science, Medicine",Unknown

The major challenge to analyze gene expression data, with a large number of genes and small samples, is to extract disease-related information from a massive amount of redundant data and noise. Gene selection, eliminating redundant and irrelevant genes, has been a key step to address this problem. The modified method was tested on four benchmark datasets with either two-class phenotypes or multiclass phenotypes, outperforming previous methods, with relatively higher accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate and reduced runtime. This paper proposes an effective feature selection method, combining double RBF-kernels with weighted analysis, to extract feature genes from gene expression data, by exploring its nonlinear mapping ability.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,,19,N/A,2018,2018-10-29 00:00:00,76,32,"Shenghui Liu, Chunrui Xu, Yusen Zhang, Jiaguo Liu, Bin Yu, Xiaoping Liu, M.

Contrary to what might be expected, the models derived from the CheqSol experimental data are not more accurate than those derived from the ""noisy"" literature data. The results suggest that, at the present time, it is the deficiency of QSPR methods (algorithms and/or descriptor sets), and not, as is commonly quoted, the uncertainty in the experimental measurements, which is the limiting factor in accurately predicting aqueous solubility for pharmaceutical molecules.",Molecular Pharmaceutics,journal,['JournalArticle'],bfba025f-b9ce-44b1-a200-eec39dd09964,Molecular pharmaceutics,"

We make predictions of solution free energy using physics-based theory alone and using machine learning/quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) models. We also develop machine learning models where the theoretical energies and cheminformatics descriptors are used as combined input. These models are used to predict solvation free energy. While direct theoretical calculation does not give accurate results in this approach, machine learning is able to give predictions with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼1.1 log S units in a 10-fold cross-validation for our Drug-Like-Solubility-100 (DLS-100) dataset of 100 druglike molecules. We find that a model built using energy terms from our theoretical methodology as descriptors is marginally less predictive than one built on Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) descriptors. Combining both sets of descriptors allows a further but very modest improvement in the predictions. However, in some cases, this is a statistically significant enhancement. These results suggest that there is little complementarity between the chemical information provided by these two sets of descriptors, despite their different sources and methods of calculation.

However, these current datasets miss important derived descriptors such as ECG features that have been devised in the past hundred years and still form the basis of most automatic ECG analysis algorithms and are critical for cardiologists’ decision processes. ECG features are available from sophisticated commercial software but are not accessible to the general public. To alleviate this issue, we add ECG features from two leading commercial algorithms and an open-source implementation supplemented by a set of automatic diagnostic statements from a commercial ECG analysis software in preprocessed format. This allows the comparison of ML models trained on clinically versus automatically generated label sets. We provide an extensive technical validation of features and diagnostic statements for ML applications.

It is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, stroke, and premature death. Clinical diagnostic criteria comprise an increased P wave duration and biphasic P waves in lead II, III and aVF due to retrograde activation of the left atrium. Machine learning algorithms could improve the diagnosis but require a large-scale, well-controlled and balanced dataset. In silico electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, optimally obtained from a statistical shape model to cover anatomical variability, carry the potential to produce an extensive database meeting the requirements for successful machine learning application. We generated the first in silico dataset including interatrial conduction block of 9,800 simulated ECG signals based on a bi-atrial statistical shape model. Automated feature analysis was performed to evaluate P wave morphology, duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1. Increased P wave duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1 were found for models with interatrial conduction block compared to healthy models. A wide variability of P wave morphology was detected for models with interatrial conduction block. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results suggest that a biphasic P wave morphology seems to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of interatrial conduction block.

However, the process of building personalized computational models can be challenging and requires a high level of human interaction. A pipeline to standardize the generation of a patient's atrial digital twin from clinical data is therefore desirable. We propose a patient-specific Augmented Atria generation pipeline (AugmentA) as a highly automated framework which, starting from clinical geometrical data, provides ready-to-use atrial personalized computational models. AugmentA consists firstly of a pre-processing step applied to the input geometry. Secondly, the atrial orifices are identified and labelled using only one reference point per atrium. If the user chooses to fit a statistical shape model (SSM) to the input geometry, it is first rigidly aligned with the given mean shape before a non-rigid fitting procedure is applied. AugmentA automatically generates the fiber orientation and finds local conduction velocities by minimizing the error between the simulated and clinical local activation time (LAT) map. The pipeline was tested on a cohort of 29 patients on both segmented magnetic resonance images (MRI) and electroanatomical maps of the left atrium. Moreover, the pipeline was applied to a bi-atrial volumetric mesh derived from MRI. The pipeline robustly integrated fiber orientation and anatomical region annotations in 38.4+-5.7 s. The error between in-silico and clinical LAT maps was on average 12.7 ms. In conclusion, AugmentA offers an automated and comprehensive pipeline delivering atrial digital twins from clinical data in procedural time.",medRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],d5e5b5e7-54b1-4f53-82fc-4853f3e71c58,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society,"

Intra-cardiac electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation are often performed without detailed prior knowledge of the mechanism perpetuating AFlut, likely prolonging the procedure time of these invasive interventions. We sought to discriminate the AFlut location [cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent (CTI), peri-mitral, and other left atrium (LA) AFlut classes] with a machine learning-based algorithm using only the non-invasive signals from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Methods and results Hybrid 12-lead ECG dataset of 1769 signals was used (1424 in silico ECGs, and 345 clinical ECGs from 115 patients—three different ECG segments over time were extracted from each patient corresponding to single AFlut cycles). Seventy-seven features were extracted. A decision tree classifier with a hold-out classification approach was trained, validated, and tested on the dataset randomly split after selecting the most informative features. The clinical test set comprised 38 patients (114 clinical ECGs). The classifier yielded 76.3% accuracy on the clinical test set with a sensitivity of 89.7%, 75.0%, and 64.1% and a positive predictive value of 71.4%, 75.0%, and 86.2% for CTI, peri-mitral, and other LA class, respectively. Considering majority vote of the three segments taken from each patient, the CTI class was correctly classified at 92%. Conclusion Our results show that a machine learning classifier relying only on non-invasive signals can potentially identify the location of AFlut mechanisms.

Although a 3D patient-specific model (PSM) can be obtained from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the fiber orientation of cardiac muscle, which significantly affects the electrophysiological and mechanical characteristics of the heart, can hardly be obtained in vivo. Several approaches have been suggested to solve this problem. However, most of them require a considerable amount of human interaction, which is both time-consuming and a potential source of error. In this work, a highly automated pipeline based on a Laplace- Dirichlet-rule-based method (LDRBM) for annotating fibers and anatomical regions in both atria is introduced. The calculated fiber arrangement was regionally compared with anatomical observations from literature and faithfully reproduced clinical and experimental data.",Current Directions in Biomedical Engineering,journal,,0c1d66cd-6730-4184-b27c-59fdd4dd9ef7,Current Directions in Biomedical Engineering,136 - 139,7,N/A,2021,2021-10-01 00:00:00,11,0,"Tianbao Zheng, L.

Building CDTs of cardiac EP relies on the ability of models to replicate the ventricular activation sequence under a broad range of conditions. Of pivotal importance is the His–Purkinje system (HPS) within the ventricles. Workflows for the generation and incorporation of HPS models are needed for use in cardiac digital twinning pipelines that aim to minimize the misfit between model predictions and clinical data such as the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG). We thus develop an automated two stage approach for HPS personalization. A fascicular-based model is first introduced that modulates the endocardial Purkinje network. Only emergent features of sites of earliest activation within the ventricular myocardium and a fast-conducting sub-endocardial layer are accounted for. It is then replaced by a topologically realistic Purkinje-based representation of the HPS. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated. Equivalence between both HPS model representations is investigated by comparing activation patterns and 12 lead ECGs under both sinus rhythm and right-ventricular apical pacing. Predominant ECG morphology is preserved by both HPS models under sinus conditions, but elucidates differences during pacing.",Annals of Biomedical Engineering,journal,['JournalArticle'],ea9d4180-f603-445c-b59a-5aaada9d4d83,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,3143 - 3153,49,N/A,2021,2021-08-24 00:00:00,41,34,"K.

A healthy heart can be modeled starting from the ion channels via the spread of a depolarization wave on a realistic geometry of the human heart up to the potentials on the body surface and the ECG. Research is advancing regarding modeling diseases of the heart. This article reviews progress in calculating and analyzing the corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) from simulated depolarization and repolarization waves. First, we describe modeling of the P-wave, the QRS complex and the T-wave of a healthy heart. Then, both the modeling and the corresponding ECGs of several important diseases and arrhythmias are delineated: ischemia and infarction, ectopic beats and extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia, bundle branch blocks, atrial tachycardia, flutter and fibrillation, genetic diseases and channelopathies, imbalance of electrolytes and drug-induced changes. Finally, we outline the potential impact of computer modeling on ECG interpretation. Computer modeling can contribute to a better comprehension of the relation between features in the ECG and the underlying cardiac condition and disease. It can pave the way for a quantitative analysis of the ECG and can support the cardiologist in identifying events or non-invasively localizing diseased areas. Finally, it can deliver very large databases of reliably labeled ECGs as training data for machine learning.",,Unknown,['Review'],Unknown,,350-368,2,Unknown,2021,2021-07-26 00:00:00,20,122,"O.

Here, we introduce a number of improvements to the DeepTop tagger, including architecture, training, image preprocessing, sample size and color pixels. Our final CNN top tagger outperforms BDTs based on high-level inputs by a factor of ∼ 2-3 or more in background rejection, over a wide range of tagging efficiencies and fiducial jet selections. As reference points, we achieve a QCD background rejection factor of 500 (60) at 50% top tagging efficiency for fully-merged (non-merged) top jets with pT in the 800-900 GeV (350-450 GeV) range.

In particle physics, this challenge is surmounted by the use of simulations. These simulations accurately reproduce most features of data, but cannot be trusted to capture all of the complex correlations exploitable by modern machine learning methods. Recent work in weakly supervised learning has shown that simple, low-dimensional classifiers can be trained using only the impure mixtures present in data. Here, we demonstrate that complex, high-dimensional classifiers can also be trained on impure mixtures using weak supervision techniques, with performance comparable to what could be achieved with pure samples. Using weak supervision will therefore allow us to avoid relying exclusively on simulations for high-dimensional classification. This work opens the door to a new regime whereby complex models are trained directly on data, providing direct access to probe the underlying physics.",Physical Review D,Unknown,,Unknown,Physical Review D,,,Unknown,2018,2018-01-30 00:00:00,75,59,"Patrick T.

However, its relation with other CV risk evaluation tools in T1D has not been elucidated yet. This study aimed to evaluate arterial stiffness in T1D patients free from known CVD, and compare it to other CV risk evaluation tools used in T1D. Methods Cross-sectional study in adults with a T1D duration of at least 10 years and without established CVD. Patients were categorized in CVD risk groups based on 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines , and the STENO T1D risk engine was used to estimate 10-year risk for CV events. Arterial stiffness was evaluated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score was assessed and carotid ultrasound was performed. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and central hemodynamic parameters were evaluated. Data on renal function and diabetic kidney disease was retrieved. Results 54 patients (age: 46 ± 9.5 years; T1D duration: 27 ± 8.8 years) were included. One-fourth of patients showed prematurely increased aortic stiffness based on cf-PWV (24%). Cf-PWV was significantly associated with CAC score, carotid intima-media thickness, central hemodynamic parameters and diabetic kidney disease. Based on STENO, 20 patients (37%) were at low, 20 patients (37%) at moderate, and 14 patients (26%) at high 10-year risk for CV event. Cf-PWV was strongly associated with the STENO score (r s  = + 0.81; R 2  = 0.566, p < 0.001), increasing with each higher STENO group (p < 0.01). However, cf-PWV was not significantly different between the two CV risk groups (high versus very high) based on ESC criteria, and ESC criteria compared to STENO classified 10 patients more as having > 10% 10-year risk for CV events (n = 44/54; 81.5% versus n = 34/54; 63%). Conclusions This study demonstrated that a substantial proportion of long-standing T1D patients free from known CVD show premature arterial stiffening. Cf-PWV strongly associates with the STENO risk score for future CV events and with cardiovascular imaging and function outcomes, thereby illustrating the clinical importance of arterial stiffness. The data, however, also show considerable heterogeneity in CV risk and differences in risk categorisation between the STENO tool and ESC criteria.There is a need for refinement of CV risk classification in T1D, and future studies should investigate if evaluation of arterial stiffness should be implemented in T1D clinical practice and which patients benefit the most from its assessment.",Cardiovascular Diabetology,journal,['JournalArticle'],e370d142-085d-49ec-8cac-604c340365b8,Cardiovascular Diabetology,,21,N/A,2022,2022-06-09 00:00:00,11,57,"S.

Methods We retrospectively collected electronic medical records of enrolled patients from the data warehouse of China Medical University Hospital, a tertiary medical center in central Taiwan, from January 2012 to November 2018. We included patients who underwent a documented carotid ultrasound within 30 days of experiencing an acute first stroke during the study period. We classified these participants into two groups: those with non-recurrent stroke (those who has not been diagnosed with acute stroke again during the study period) and those with recurrent stoke (those who has been diagnosed with acute stroke during the study period). A total of 1,235 carotid sonographic parameters were analyzed. Data on the patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities were also collected. Python 3.7 was used as the programming language, and the scikit-learn toolkit was used to complete the derivation and verification of the machine learning methods. Results In total, 2,411 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 1,896 and 515 had non-recurrent and recurrent stroke, respectively. After extraction, 43 features of carotid sonography (36 carotid sonographic parameters and seven transcranial color Doppler sonographic parameter) were analyzed. For predicting recurrent stroke, CatBoost achieved the highest area under the curve (0.844, CIs 95% 0.824–0.868), followed by the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (0.832, CIs 95% 0.813–0.851), random forest (0.819, CIs 95% 0.802–0.846), support-vector machine (0.759, CIs 95% 0.739–0.781), logistic regression (0.781, CIs 95% 0.764–0.800), and decision tree (0.735, CIs 95% 0.717–0.755) models. Conclusion When using the CatBoost model, the top three features for predicting recurrent stroke were determined to be the use of anticoagulation medications, the use of NSAID medications, and the resistive index of the left subclavian artery. The CatBoost model demonstrated efficiency and achieved optimal performance in the predictive classification of non-recurrent and recurrent stroke.",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],3bc0e661-dc2a-454a-9ff5-6515430ce9ff,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,,9,N/A,2022,2022-01-28 00:00:00,11,83,"Shih-Yi Lin, Kin-Man Law, Y.

Methods: The cardiometabolic risk profile was defined based on the Adult Treatment Panel III panel. Carotid intimal media thickness (cIMT) and arterial stiffness were assessed using high-resolution ultrasonography. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to estimate the association between FM and cardiometabolic risk factors. We used a general linear regression to compare the cIMT and carotid beta-index between the participants with and without FM. Pearson’s coefficient was calculated to evaluate the potential correlation between cardiometabolic risk profiles, cIMT, and arterial stiffening in FM. Results: FM participants showed a higher risk of central obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49, 6.91), high triglyceride (OR = 4.73, 95% CI 2.29, 9.79), and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (OR = 4.27, 95% CI 2.07, 8.81) compared to the control group. The FM group exhibited higher beta-index values than the control group (p = 0.003). Although IFG and triglyceride glucose index showed a tendency to correlate with the beta-index, statistical significance was not observed. Conclusions: FM was associated with an increased risk of central obesity, high triglyceride levels, and IFG. Furthermore, advanced arterial stiffness of the carotid artery was observed in FM, which might be correlated with insulin resistance.",Biomedicines,journal,['JournalArticle'],abc0c598-b988-4841-a8c5-65bfa6f3df77,Biomedicines,,9,N/A,2021,2021-11-28 00:00:00,8,46,"Yunkyung Kim, Geun-Tae Kim, Jihun Kang","123633623, 5500247, 147091329",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfc5dc6c78ce1461a335cd2e669243470b42d606,Medicine,123633623

The incidence of cardiovascular events remains high in diabetics. However, a clinical prediction model for elevated arterial stiffness using machine learning to identify subjects consequently at higher risk remains to be developed. Methods Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination were used for feature selection. Four machine learning algorithms were used to construct a prediction model, and their performance was compared based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric in a discovery dataset (n = 760). The model with the best performance was selected and validated in an independent dataset (n = 912) from the Dryad Digital Repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m484p). To apply our model to clinical practice, we built a free and user-friendly web online tool. Results The predictive model includes the predictors: age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index. In the discovery cohort, the gradient boosting-based model outperformed other methods in the elevated arterial stiffness prediction. In the validation cohort, the gradient boosting model showed a good discrimination capacity. A cutoff value of 0.46 for the elevated arterial stiffness risk score in the gradient boosting model resulted in a good specificity (0.813 in the discovery data and 0.761 in the validation data) and sensitivity (0.875 and 0.738, respectively) trade-off points. Conclusion The gradient boosting-based prediction system presents a good classification in elevated arterial stiffness prediction. The web online tool makes our gradient boosting-based model easily accessible for further clinical studies and utilization.",Frontiers in Physiology,journal,['JournalArticle'],e28a224b-8ddb-49a6-82d2-17f23c68b30c,Frontiers in Physiology,,12,N/A,2021,2021-08-23 00:00:00,8,50,"Qingqing Li, Wenhui Xie, Liping Li, Lijing Wang, Qinyi You, Lu Chen, Jing Li, Yilang Ke, Jun Fang, Libin Liu, Huashan Hong","2262197058, 2151884853, 2154789607, 49681421, 2124290365, 2145147016, 2152912155, 2653732, 2148251980, 51038983, 35716315",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c877011c08d73c6442e2683d4e3a5d240afc9ed,"Computer Science, Medicine",2262197058

We wished to validate this effect and explore potential mechanisms of action. Methods In a multicentre inception cohort of eRA patients (n=191), we examined the whole blood IGS (MxA, IFI44L, OAS1, IFI6, ISG15) with reference to circulating IFN proteins, clinical outcomes and epigenetic influences on circulating CD19+ B and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Results We reproduced our previous findings demonstrating a raised baseline IGS. We additionally showed, for the first time, that the IGS in eRA reflects circulating IFN-α protein. Paired longitudinal analysis demonstrated a significant reduction between baseline and 6-month IGS and IFN-α levels (p<0.0001 for both). Despite this fall, a raised baseline IGS predicted worse 6-month clinical outcomes such as increased disease activity score (DAS-28, p=0.025) and lower likelihood of a good EULAR clinical response (p=0.034), which was independent of other conventional predictors of disease activity and clinical response. Molecular analysis of CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells demonstrated differentially methylated CPG sites and dysregulated expression of disease relevant genes, including PARP9, STAT1, and EPSTI1, associated with baseline IGS/IFNα levels. Differentially methylated CPG sites implicated altered transcription factor binding in B cells (GATA3, ETSI, NFATC2, EZH2) and T cells (p300, HIF1α). Conclusions Our data suggest that, in eRA, IFN-α can cause a sustained, epigenetically mediated, pathogenic increase in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and that the IGS is, therefore, a robust prognostic biomarker. Its persistent harmful effects provide a rationale for the initial therapeutic targeting of IFN-α in selected patients with eRA.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,journal,['JournalArticle'],2457f111-719e-405a-8b99-3e2ad59ad1e3,Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,1214 - 1223,81,N/A,2022,2022-06-09 00:00:00,27,50,"Faye A H Cooles, J.

Approximately 40% of patients do not respond to individual biologic therapies and 5–20% are refractory to all. In a biopsy-based, precision-medicine, randomized clinical trial in RA (R4RA; n = 164), patients with low/absent synovial B cell molecular signature had a lower response to rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) compared with that to tocilizumab (anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody) although the exact mechanisms of response/nonresponse remain to be established. Here, in-depth histological/molecular analyses of R4RA synovial biopsies identify humoral immune response gene signatures associated with response to rituximab and tocilizumab, and a stromal/fibroblast signature in patients refractory to all medications. Post-treatment changes in synovial gene expression and cell infiltration highlighted divergent effects of rituximab and tocilizumab relating to differing response/nonresponse mechanisms. Using ten-by-tenfold nested cross-validation, we developed machine learning algorithms predictive of response to rituximab (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74), tocilizumab (AUC = 0.68) and, notably, multidrug resistance (AUC = 0.69). This study supports the notion that disease endotypes, driven by diverse molecular pathology pathways in the diseased tissue, determine diverse clinical and treatment–response phenotypes. It also highlights the importance of integration of molecular pathology signatures into clinical algorithms to optimize the future use of existing medications and inform the development of new drugs for refractory patients. Biomarker analysis of the phase 4 R4RA trial identifies pretreatment synovial biopsy features selectively associated with response to rituximab or tocilizumab, and leads to the development of models that might predict treatment benefit in patients with rheumatoid arthritis",Nature Network Boston,journal,['JournalArticle'],9e995b6d-f30b-4ab4-a13b-3dc2cc992f47,Nature Medicine,1256 - 1268,28,N/A,2022,2022-05-19 00:00:00,148,54,"F.

Monocytes (MOs) and macrophages, largely associated with arthritis, are contributors and sensors of inflammation through epigenetic modifications. In this study, we investigated associations between clinical features and DNA methylation in blood and synovial fluid (SF) MOs in a prospective cohort of patients with early inflammatory arthritis. DNA methylation profiles of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) blood MOs exhibited marked alterations in comparison with those from healthy donors. We identified additional differences both in blood and SF MOs after comparing patients with UA grouped by their future outcomes, i.e., good versus poor. Patient profiles in subsequent visits revealed a reversion toward a healthy level in both groups, those requiring disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and those who remitted spontaneously. Changes in disease activity between visits also affected DNA methylation, which was partially concomitant in the SF of UA and in blood MOs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Epigenetic similarities between arthritis types allow a common prediction of disease activity. Our results constitute a resource of DNA methylation–based biomarkers of poor prognosis, disease activity, and treatment efficacy for the personalized clinical management of early inflammatory arthritis.",JCI Insight,journal,['JournalArticle'],e6c392b4-b4fc-409c-8ff2-c490c0407611,JCI Insight,,7,N/A,2022,2022-03-24 00:00:00,12,56,"C. de la Calle-Fabregat, J.

This potential is encapsulated by the concept of a quantum advantage, which is contingent on a reduction in the consumption of a computational resource, such as time, space or data. Here, we distill the concept of a quantum advantage into a simple framework to aid researchers in biology and medicine pursuing the development of quantum applications. We then apply this framework to a wide variety of computational problems relevant to these domains in an effort to (i) assess the potential of practical advantages in specific application areas and (ii) identify gaps that may be addressed with novel quantum approaches. In doing so, we provide an extensive survey of the intersection of biology and medicine with the current landscape of quantum algorithms and their potential advantages. While we endeavour to identify specific computational problems that may admit practical advantages throughout this work, the rapid pace of change in the fields of quantum computing, classical algorithms and biological research implies that this intersection will remain highly dynamic for the foreseeable future.",Journal of the Royal Society Interface,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",f6537e0e-c3a9-4de5-bd36-19eda0434065,Journal of the Royal Society Interface,,19,N/A,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,48,466,"Benjamin A.

However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits. Expectations for quantum machine learning are high, but there is currently a lack of rigorous results on which scenarios would actually exhibit a quantum advantage. Here, the authors show how to tell, for a given dataset, whether a quantum model would give any prediction advantage over a classical one.",Nature Communications,journal,['JournalArticle'],43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,12,N/A,2020,2020-11-03 00:00:00,581,65,"Hsin-Yuan Huang, M.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) protect networks by using patterns to detect malicious traffic. As attackers have tried to dissimulate traffic in order to evade the rules applied, several machine learning-based IDSs have been developed. In this study, we focused on one such model involving several algorithms and used the NSL-KDD dataset as a benchmark to train and evaluate its performance. We demonstrate a way to create adversarial instances of network traffic that can be used to evade detection by a machine learning-based IDS. Moreover, this traffic can be used for training in order to improve performance in the case of new attacks. Thus, a generative adversarial network (GAN)—i.e., an architecture based on a deep-learning algorithm capable of creating generative models—was implemented. Furthermore, we tested the IDS performance using the generated adversarial traffic. The results showed that, even in the case of the GAN-generated traffic (which could successfully evade IDS detection), by using the adversarial traffic in the testing process, we could improve the machine learning-based IDS performance.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,23,20233dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2023,2023-01-24 00:00:00,14,24,"Andrei-Grigore Mari, Daniel Zinca, V.

The MCTS algorithm enables the generation model to provide a reward value that reflects the probability of generative examples bypassing the detector. To guarantee the antagonism and feasibility of the generative adversarial examples, the bypassing rules are restricted. The experimental results indicate that the missed detection rate of adversarial examples is significantly improved after the MCTS-T generation algorithm.

Based on the unsupervised learning models autoencoder (AE) and the generative adversarial networks (GAN) model during deep learning, the study aim is to solve the imbalance of data and intrusion detection of high performance. The AE-CGAN (autoencoder-conditional GAN) model is proposed to improve the performance of intrusion detection. This model oversamples rare classes based on the GAN model in order to solve the performance degradation caused by data imbalance after processing the characteristics of the data to a lower level using the autoencoder model. To measure the performance of the AE-CGAN model, data is classified using random forest (RF), a typical machine learning classification algorithm. In this experiment, we used the canadian institute for cybersecurity intrusion detection system (CICIDS)2017 dataset, the latest public dataset of network intrusion detection system (NIDS), and compared the three models to confirm efficacy of the proposed model. We compared the performance of three types of models. These included single-RF, a classification model using only a classification algorithm, AE-RF which is processed by classifying data features, and the AE-CGAN model which is classified after solving the data feature processing and data imbalance. Experimental results showed that the performance of the AE-CGAN model proposed in this paper was the highest. In particular, when the data were unbalanced, the performances of recall and F1 score, which are more accurate performance indicators, were 93.29% and 95.38%, respectively. The AE-CGAN model showed much better performance.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2019,2019-10-10 00:00:00,46,30,"Joohwa Lee, Kee-Hyun Park","2108413988, 50788962",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/875634a8eed00a679ee2db9dd6475e19912b124b,"Computer Science, Engineering",2108413988

The rate of attacks against networked systems has increased dramatically, and the tactics used by the attackers are continuing to evolve. Intrusion detection is one of the solutions against these attacks. A common and effective approach for designing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is Machine Learning. The performance of an IDS is significantly improved when the features are more discriminative and representative. This study uses two feature dimensionality reduction approaches: (i) Auto-Encoder (AE): an instance of deep learning, for dimensionality reduction, and (ii) Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting low-dimensional features from both techniques are then used to build various classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Network, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for designing an IDS. The experimental findings with low-dimensional features in binary and multi-class classification show better performance in terms of Detection Rate (DR), F-Measure, False Alarm Rate (FAR), and Accuracy.

Optimizing the standard digital back propagation (DBP) as a deep neural network (DNN) with interleaving linear and nonlinear operations for fiber nonlinearity compensation was shown to improve transmission performance in idealized simulation environments. Here, we extend such concepts to practical single-channel and polarization division multiplexed wavelength division multiplexed experiments. We show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art DSP algorithms and additionally, the optimized DNN-based DBP parameters exhibit a mathematical structure which guides us to further analyze the noise statistics of fiber nonlinearity compensation. This machine learning-inspired analysis reveals that ASE noise and incomplete CD compensation of the Kerr nonlinear term produce extra distortions that accumulates along the DBP stages. Therefore, the best DSP should balance between suppressing these distortions and inverting the fiber propagation effects, and such trade-off shifts across different DBP stages in a quantifiable manner. Instead of the common ‘black-box’ approach to intractable problems, our work shows how machine learning can be a complementary tool to human analytical thinking and help advance theoretical understandings in disciplines such as optics. Nonlinear effects provide inherent limitations in fiber optical communications.

The goal of this research work is to develop a system that can effectively detect fall/collapse and classify other discrete daily living activities such as sitting, standing, walking, drinking, and bending. For this paper, a publicly accessible dataset is employed, which is captured at various geographical locations using a 5.8 GHz Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) RADAR. A total of ninety-nine participants, including young and elderly individuals, took part in the experimental campaign. During data acquisition, each aforementioned activity was recorded for 5–10 s. Through the obtained data, we generated the micro-doppler signatures using short-time Fourier transform by exploiting MATLAB tools. Subsequently, the micro-doppler signatures are validated, trained, and tested using a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm called Residual Neural Network or ResNet. The ResNet classifier is developed in Python, which is utilised to classify six distinct human activities in this study. Furthermore, the metrics used to analyse the trained model’s performance are precision, recall, F1-score, classification accuracy, and confusion matrix. To test the resilience of the proposed method, two separate experiments are carried out. The trained ResNet models are put to the test by subject-independent scenarios and unseen data of the above-mentioned human activities at diverse geographical spaces. The experimental results showed that ResNet detected the falling and rest of the daily living human activities with decent accuracy.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2021,2021-09-12 00:00:00,32,59,"Umer Saeed, Syed Yaseen Shah, Syed Aziz Shah, Jawad Ahmad, A.

This health status is determined by the apparent decline of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs). Detecting ADLs provides possibilities of improving the home life of elderly people as it can be applied to fall detection systems. This paper presents fall detection in elderly people based on radar image classification by examining their daily routine activities, using radar data that were previously collected for 99 volunteers. Machine learning techniques are used classify six human activities, namely walking, sitting, standing, picking up objects, drinking water and fall events. Different machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, long short-term memory, bi-directional long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks, were used for data classification. To obtain optimum results, we applied data processing techniques, such as principal component analysis and data augmentation, to the available radar images. The aim of this paper is to improve upon the results achieved using a publicly available dataset to further improve upon research of fall detection systems. It was found out that the best results were obtained using the CNN algorithm with principal component analysis and data augmentation together to obtain a result of 95.30% accuracy.

In real environments, activities and movements are performed with seamless motion, with continuous transitions between activities of different duration and a large range of dynamic motions, compared with discrete activities of fixed-time lengths which are typically analysed in the literature. This paper proposes a novel approach based on recurrent LSTM and Bi-LSTM network architectures for continuous activity monitoring and classification. This approach uses radar data in the form of a continuous temporal sequence of micro-Doppler or range-time information, differently from from other conventional approaches based on convolutional networks that interpret the radar data as images. Experimental radar data involving 15 participants and different sequences of 6 actions are used to validate the proposed approach. It is demonstrated that using the Doppler-domain data together with the Bi-LSTM network and an optimal learning rate can achieve over 90% mean accuracy, whereas range-domain data only achieved approximately 76%.

As such, fall detection is a crucial topic. However, due to the trade-off relationship between privacy preservation, user convenience, and fall detection performance, it is generally difficult to develop a fall detection system that simultaneously satisfies all conditions. The main goal of this study is to build a practical fall detection framework that can effectively classify the various behavior types into “Fall” and “Activities of daily living (ADL)” while securing privacy preservation and user convenience. For this purpose, signal data containing the motion information of objects was collected using a non-contact, unobtrusive, and non-restraint impulse-radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) radar. These data were then applied to a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to create an object behavior type classifier that can classify the behavior types of objects into “Fall” and “ADL.” The data were collected by actually performing various activities of daily living, including falling. The performance of the classifier yielded satisfactory results.

First, the traditional radar frequency band is difficult to meet the requirements of fine identification with due to its low carrier frequency and limited micro-Doppler resolution. Another significant problem is that radar signal processing is relatively complex, and the existing signal processing algorithms are poor in real-time usability, robustness and universality. This paper focuses on the two basic problems of human gait detection with radar and proposes a human gait classification and recognition method based on millimeter-wave array radar. Based on deep-learning technology, a multi-channel three-dimensional convolution neural network is proposed on the basis of improving the residual network, which completes the classification and recognition of human gait through the hierarchical extraction and fusion of multi-dimensional features. Taking the three-dimensional coordinates, motion speed and intensity of strong scattering points in the process of target motion as network inputs, multi-channel convolution is used to extract motion features, and the classification and recognition of typical daily actions are completed.

However, searching for the stops is a tough task at the LHC. To dig the stops out of the huge LHC data, various expert-constructed kinematic variables or cutting-edge analysis techniques have been invented. In this paper, we propose to represent collision events as event graphs and use the message passing neutral network (MPNN) to analyze the events. As a proof-of-concept, we use our method in the search of the stop pair production at the LHC, and find that our MPNN can efficiently discriminate the signal and back-ground events. In comparison with other machine learning methods (e.g. DNN), MPNN can enhance the mass reach of stop mass by several tens of GeV to over a hundred GeV.",Journal of High Energy Physics,journal,,cb5c6d2c-8c82-406e-b42e-b691561f3e4e,Journal of High Energy Physics,,2019,N/A,2018,2018-07-24 00:00:00,61,83,"Murat Abdughani, Jie Ren, Lei Wu, Jin Min Yang","102811732, 143702195, 145233518, 152211049",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b504fb15d98b6a71a81e288ffb8d584e5567724,"Computer Science, Physics",102811732

The model aims to describe proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. A convolutional autoencoder learns a set of kernels that efficiently encode the behaviour of fully showered QCD collision events. The network is structured recursively so as to ensure self-similarity, and the number of trained network parameters is low. Randomness is introduced via a novel custom masking layer, which also preserves existing parton splittings by using layer-skipping connections. By applying a shower merging procedure, the network can be evaluated on unshowered events produced by a matrix element calculation. The trained network behaves as a parton shower that qualitatively reproduces jet-based observables.",Journal of High Energy Physics,journal,,cb5c6d2c-8c82-406e-b42e-b691561f3e4e,Journal of High Energy Physics,,2018,N/A,2018,2018-07-10 00:00:00,52,38,J.

We introduce a machine learning strategy for jet substructure analysis using a spectral function on the angular scale. The angular spectrum allows us to scan energy deposits over the angle between a pair of particles in a highly visual way. We set up an artificial neural network (ANN) to find out characteristic shapes of the spectra of the jets from heavy particle decays. By taking the Higgs jets and QCD jets as examples, we show that the ANN of the angular spectrum input has similar performance to existing taggers. In addition, some improvement is seen when additional extra radiations occur. Notably, the new algorithm automatically combines the information of the multipoint correlations in the jet.",Journal of High Energy Physics,journal,,cb5c6d2c-8c82-406e-b42e-b691561f3e4e,Journal of High Energy Physics,,2018,N/A,2018,2018-07-09 00:00:00,25,73,"Sung Hak Lim, M.

To date, NN-based top taggers demonstrated excellent performance in Monte Carlo studies. In this paper, we construct a top-jet tagger based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and apply it to parton-level boosted top samples, with and without an additional gluon in the final state. We show that the jet observable defined by the CNN obeys the canonical definition of infrared safety: it is unaffected by the presence of the extra gluon, as long as it is soft or collinear with one of the quarks. Our results indicate that the CNN tagger is robust with respect to possible mis-modeling of soft and collinear final-state radiation by Monte Carlo generators.",Journal of High Energy Physics,journal,['JournalArticle'],cb5c6d2c-8c82-406e-b42e-b691561f3e4e,Journal of High Energy Physics,,2019,N/A,2018,2018-06-04 00:00:00,39,43,"Suyong Choi, Seung J.

-parity violating supersymmetry searches at the LHC","Supersymmetry with hadronic R-parity violation in which the lightest neutralino decays into three quarks is still weakly constrained. This work aims to further improve the current search for this scenario by the boosted decision tree method with additional information from jet substructure. In particular, we find a deep neural network turns out to perform well in characterizing the neutralino jet substructure. We first construct a convolutional neutral network (CNN) which is capable of tagging the neutralino jet in any signal process by using the idea of jet image. When applied to pure jet samples, such a CNN outperforms the N-subjettiness variable by a factor of a few in tagging efficiency. Moreover, we find the method, which combines the CNN output and jet invariant mass, can perform better and is applicable to a wider range of neutralino mass than the CNN alone. Finally, the ATLAS search for the signal of gluino pair production with subsequent decay g˜→qqχ˜10(→qqq) is recast as an application. In contrast to the pure sample, the heavy contamination among jets in this complex final state renders the discriminating powers of the CNN and N subjettiness similar. By analyzing the jets substructure in events which pass the ATLAS cuts with our CNN method, the exclusion limit on gluino mass can be pushed up by ∼200  GeV for neutralino mass ∼100  GeV.",Physical Review D,Unknown,,Unknown,Physical Review D,,,Unknown,2018,2018-05-27 00:00:00,19,63,"Jun Guo, Jinmian Li, Tianjun Li, Fang-Zhou Xu, Wenxing Zhang","2217372496, 2115977488, 8036855, 11047093, 2108143908",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da88d9a10a39305902356c0be707bd963b293df2,Physics,2217372496

Therefore, it is essential to broaden the sensitivity of the search program to include unexpected scenarios. We present a new model-agnostic anomaly detection technique that naturally benefits from modern machine learning algorithms. The only requirement on the signal for this new procedure is that it is localized in at least one known direction in phase space. Any other directions of phase space that are uncorrelated with the localized one can be used to search for unexpected features. This new method is applied to the dijet resonance search to show that it can turn a modest 2σ excess into a 7σ excess for a model with an intermediate BSM particle that is not currently targeted by a dedicated search.",Physical Review Letters,journal,['JournalArticle'],16c9f9d4-bee1-435d-8c85-22a3deba109d,Physical review letters,"

To this end, a powerful tool would be a framework for unsupervised learning, where the machine learns the intricate high-dimensional contours of the data upon which it is trained, without reference to pre-established labels. In order to approach such a complex task, an unsupervised network must be structured intelligently, based on a qualitative understanding of the data. In this paper, we scaffold the neural network’s architecture around a leading-order model of the physics underlying the data. In addition to making unsupervised learning tractable, this design actually alleviates existing tensions between performance and interpretability. We call the framework Junipr: “Jets from UNsupervised Interpretable PRobabilistic models”. In this approach, the set of particle momenta composing a jet are clustered into a binary tree that the neural network examines sequentially. Training is unsupervised and unrestricted: the network could decide that the data bears little correspondence to the chosen tree structure. However, when there is a correspondence, the network’s output along the tree has a direct physical interpretation. Junipr models can perform discrimination tasks, through the statistically optimal likelihood-ratio test, and they permit visualizations of discrimination power at each branching in a jet’s tree. Additionally, Junipr models provide a probability distribution from which events can be drawn, providing a data-driven Monte Carlo generator. As a third application, Junipr models can reweight events from one (e.g. simulated) data set to agree with distributions from another (e.g. experimental) data set.",The European Physical Journal C,Unknown,,Unknown,The European Physical Journal C,,79,Unknown,2018,2018-04-25 00:00:00,133,81,"Anders Andreassen, Ilya Feige, C.

This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent research into novel methods for cyber threat detection, encompassing diverse approaches such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, behavioral analysis and anomaly detection. Machine learning plays a central role in cyber threat detection, highlighting the effectiveness of deep neural networks in identifying evolving threats. Their adaptability to changing attack patterns is emphasized, underlining their importance for real-time security monitoring. In parallel, ensemble learning is explored, combining multiple models to improve overall detection accuracy and create a robust defense against a spectrum of cyber threats. The literature reviewed highlights the importance of behavioral analysis, with a novel approach that integrates user behaviour profiling with anomaly detection. This has proven effective in identifying suspicious activity within a network, particularly insider threats and stealthy attacks. Another behavioral framework using User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is presented for enhanced anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of context-aware monitoring in improving threat detection accuracy. Collaborative defense mechanisms emerge as a major focus of the research papers reviewed, exploring the potential of sharing threat information between organisations to enhance collective security monitoring. Their findings underscore the importance of a collaborative approach to staying ahead of rapidly evolving cyber threats. Some types of cyber-attacks are also analysed in the context of a security operations centre (SOC) monitoring environment using a security information and event management (SIEM) tool - Splunk. In conclusion, this survey paper synthesizes recent advances in cyber threat detection methods in security monitoring that integrate machine learning, behavioral analysis, and collaborative defense strategies. As cyber threats continue to evolve, these novel methods provide valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and organisations seeking to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses. This concise overview emphasises the multi-dimensional approach required to secure digital ecosystems, providing a concise yet comprehensive guide to modern cyber threat detection strategies.",European Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security,Unknown,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference', 'Review']",Unknown,European Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security,,,Unknown,2024,2024-06-21 00:00:00,2,21,"Palvi Shelke, Timo Hamalainen","2307955161, 2307955758",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed6b9e4c5e267eb4c98f4425669ceaa9e1dfa0bc,"Computer Science, Engineering",2307955161

The majority of current research relies on feature-ready datasets that heavily depend on feature engineering. Conversely, the increasing complexity of network traffic and the ongoing evolution of attack techniques lead to a diminishing distinction between benign and malicious network behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end intrusion detection framework based on a contrastive learning approach. We design a hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to facilitate the automated extraction of spatiotemporal features from raw traffic data. The integration of contrastive learning amplifies the distinction between benign and malicious network traffic in the representation space. The proposed method exhibits enhanced detection capabilities for unknown attacks in comparison to the approaches trained using the cross-entropy loss function. Experiments are carried out on the public datasets CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, demonstrating that our method can attain a detection accuracy of 99.9% for known attacks, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance. For unknown attacks, a weighted recall rate of 95% can be achieved.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,24,20243dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2024,2024-03-26 00:00:00,5,43,"Longlong Li, Yuliang Lu, Guozheng Yang, Xuehu Yan","123698372, 7774854, 1439305880, 2271475545",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a340540c1baa09b879bbc9f874fe50764ded0379,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",123698372

XAI has emerged as a pivotal focus in achieving a zero-trust cybersecurity strategy within marine communication networks. This article presents the development of a zero-trust NIDS framework designed to detect contemporary marine cyberattacks, utilizing two modern datasets (2023 Edge-IIoTset and 2023 CICIoT). The zero-trust NIDS model achieves an optimal Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of 97.33% and an F1-score of 99% in a multi-class experiment. The XAI approach leverages visual and quantitative XAI methods, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithms, to enhance explainability and interpretability. The research results indicate that current black-box NIDS models deployed for marine cyberdefense can be made more reliable and interpretable, thereby improving the overall cybersecurity posture of marine organizations.",Electronics,journal,['JournalArticle'],ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2024,2024-01-08 00:00:00,8,53,"Ebuka Chinaechetam Nkoro, J.

Traditional NIDS are incapable of detecting modern and sophisticated attacks due to the fact that they rely on pattern-matching models or simple activity analysis. Moreover, Intelligent NIDS based on Machine Learning (ML) models are still in the early stages and often exhibit low accuracy and high false positives, making them ineffective in detecting emerging cyber-attacks. On the other hand, improved detection and prediction frameworks provided by ensemble algorithms have demonstrated impressive outcomes in specific applications. In this research, we investigate the potential of ensemble models in the enhancement of NIDS functionalities in order to provide a reliable and intelligent security defense. We present a NIDS hybrid model that uses ensemble ML techniques to identify and prevent various intrusions more successfully than stand-alone approaches. A combination of several distinct machine learning methods is integrated into a hybrid framework. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is pre-processed, and its features are engineered prior to being used to train and evaluate the proposed model structure. The performance evaluation of the ensemble of various ML classifiers demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms individual model approaches. Using all the employed experimental combination forms, the designed model significantly enhances the detection accuracy attaining more than 99%, while false positives are reduced to less than 1%.",Applied Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-12-16 00:00:00,4,26,"F.

The need for robust NIDS solutions has never been more pressing in today's digital landscape, characterized by constantly evolving cyber threats. Deploying effective NIDS can be challenging, particularly in accurately identifying network anomalies amid the ever‐increasing sophisticated and difficult‐to‐detect cyber threats. The motivation for our research stems from the recognition that while NIDS studies have made significant strides, there remains a crucial need for more effective and accurate methods to detect network anomalies. Commonly used features in NIDS studies include network logs, with some studies exploring text‐based features such as payload. However, traditional machine and deep learning models may need to be improved in learning jointly from tabular and text‐based features. Here, we present a new approach that integrates both tabular and text‐based features to improve the performance of NIDS. Our research aims to address the existing limitations of NIDS and contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient network security solutions by introducing more effective and accurate methods for detecting network anomalies. Our internal experiments have revealed that the deep learning approach utilizing tabular features produces favourable results, whereas the pre‐trained transformer approach needs to perform sufficiently. Hence, our proposed approach, which integrates both feature types using deep learning and pre‐trained transformer approaches, achieves superior performance. These findings indicate that integrating both feature types using deep learning and pre‐trained transformer approaches can significantly improve the accuracy of network anomaly detection. Moreover, our proposed approach outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art methods in terms of accuracy, F1‐score, and recall on commonly used NIDS datasets consisting of ISCX‐IDS2012, UNSW‐NB15, and CIC‐IDS2017, with F1‐scores of 99.80%, 92.37%, and 99.69%, respectively, indicating its effectiveness in detecting network anomalies.",Expert Syst.

However, the black-box nature of AI models presents a significant challenge. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand and trust the results. In order to address this, it is necessary to incorporate explainability into the detection model. There is insufficient research to provide reasons why applications are detected as malicious or explain their behavior. In this paper, we propose a method of a Vision Transformer(ViT)-based malware detection model and malicious behavior extraction using an attention map to achieve high detection accuracy and high interpretability. Malware detection uses a ViT-based model, which takes an image as input. ViT offers a significant advantage for image detection tasks by leveraging attention mechanisms, enabling robust interpretation and understanding of the intricate patterns within the images. The image is converted from an application. An attention map is generated with attention values generated during the detection process. The attention map is used to identify factors that the model deems important. Class and method names are extracted and provided based on the identified factors. The performance of the detection was validated using real-world datasets. The malware detection accuracy was 80.27%, which is a high level of accuracy compared to other models used for image-based malware detection. The interpretability was measured in the same way as the F1-score, resulting in an interpretability score of 0.70. This score is superior to existing interpretable machine learning (ML)-based methods, such as Drebin, LIME, and XMal. By analyzing malicious applications, we also confirmed that the extracted classes and methods are related to malicious behavior. With the proposed method, security experts can understand the reason behind the model’s detection and the behavior of malicious applications. Given the growing importance of explainable artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, this method is expected to make a significant contribution to this field.",Applied Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-06-05 00:00:00,13,21,"Jeonggeun Jo, Jaeik Cho, Jongsub Moon","2223031761, 2915765, 1805429",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c68ecb3e20c68135429c78eaf4a7984451e8996,Computer Science,2223031761

This approach assumes homogeneous groups in terms of profiles and response to external effectors. These assumptions are not always fulfilled, especially in complex natural systems, like the microbiome of the human gut. It is actually established that humans with otherwise the same demographic or dietary backgrounds can have distinct microbial profiles. We suggest an alternative approach to the analysis of microbial time-series, based on the following premises: 1) microbial communities are organized in distinct clusters of similar composition at any time point, 2) these intrinsic subsets of communities could have different responses to the same external effects, and 3) the fate of the communities is largely deterministic given the same external conditions. Therefore, tracking the transition of communities, rather than individual taxa, across these states, can enhance our understanding of the ecological processes and allow the prediction of future states, by incorporating applied effects. We implement these ideas into Cronos, an analytical pipeline written in R. Cronos’ inputs are a microbial composition table (e.g., OTU table), their phylogenetic relations as a tree, and the associated metadata. Cronos detects the intrinsic microbial profile clusters on all time points, describes them in terms of composition, and records the transitions between them. Cluster assignments, combined with the provided metadata, are used to model the transitions and predict samples’ fate under various effects. We applied Cronos to available data from growing infants’ gut microbiomes, and we observe two distinct trajectories corresponding to breastfed and formula-fed infants that eventually converge to profiles resembling those of mature individuals.

This is due in part to the fact that there are no labels or gold standards by which performance can be measured. Moreover, the wide range of clustering methods available is governed by different objective functions, different parameters, and dissimilarity measures. The purpose of clustering is versatile, often playing critical roles in the early stages of exploratory data analysis and as an endpoint for knowledge and discovery. Thus, understanding the quality of a clustering is of critical importance. The concept of stability has emerged as a strategy for assessing the performance and reproducibility of data clustering. The key idea is to produce perturbed data sets that are very close to the original, and cluster them. If the clustering is stable, then the clusters from the original data will be preserved in the perturbed data clustering. The nature of the perturbation, and the methods for quantifying similarity between clusterings, are nontrivial, and ultimately what distinguishes many of the stability estimation methods apart. In this review, we provide an overview of the very active research area of cluster stability estimation and discuss some of the open questions and challenges that remain in the field.",Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics,Unknown,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",Unknown,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews.

These topics are traditionally taught in disparate courses, making it hard for data science or computer science students, or professionals, to efficiently learn the mathematics. This self-contained textbook bridges the gap between mathematical and machine learning texts, introducing the mathematical concepts with a minimum of prerequisites. It uses these concepts to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. For students and others with a mathematical background, these derivations provide a starting point to machine learning texts. For those learning the mathematics for the first time, the methods help build intuition and practical experience with applying mathematical concepts. Every chapter includes worked examples and exercises to test understanding. Programming tutorials are offered on the book's web site. This textbook considers statistical learning applications when interest centers on the conditional distribution of a response variable, given a set of predictors, and in the absence of a credible model that can be specified before the data analysis begins.

13d425987501e4ce59db5cddda299df525c5c234,10.3390/s17071513,Analysis of Public Datasets for Wearable Fall Detection Systems,"Due to the boom of wireless handheld devices such as smartwatches and smartphones, wearable Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) have become a major focus of attention among the research community during the last years. The effectiveness of a wearable FDS must be contrasted against a wide variety of measurements obtained from inertial sensors during the occurrence of falls and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). In this regard, the access to public databases constitutes the basis for an open and systematic assessment of fall detection techniques. This paper reviews and appraises twelve existing available data repositories containing measurements of ADLs and emulated falls envisaged for the evaluation of fall detection algorithms in wearable FDSs. The analysis of the found datasets is performed in a comprehensive way, taking into account the multiple factors involved in the definition of the testbeds deployed for the generation of the mobility samples. The study of the traces brings to light the lack of a common experimental benchmarking procedure and, consequently, the large heterogeneity of the datasets from a number of perspectives (length and number of samples, typology of the emulated falls and ADLs, characteristics of the test subjects, features and positions of the sensors, etc.). Concerning this, the statistical analysis of the samples reveals the impact of the sensor range on the reliability of the traces. In addition, the study evidences the importance of the selection of the ADLs and the need of categorizing the ADLs depending on the intensity of the movements in order to evaluate the capability of a certain detection algorithm to discriminate falls from ADLs.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-06-27 00:00:00,116,55,"E.

However, there are few publicly available datasets, all recorded with smartphones, which are insufficient for testing new proposals due to their absence of objective population, lack of performed activities, and limited information. Here, we present a dataset of falls and activities of daily living (ADLs) acquired with a self-developed device composed of two types of accelerometer and one gyroscope. It consists of 19 ADLs and 15 fall types performed by 23 young adults, 15 ADL types performed by 14 healthy and independent participants over 62 years old, and data from one participant of 60 years old that performed all ADLs and falls. These activities were selected based on a survey and a literature analysis. We test the dataset with widely used feature extraction and a simple to implement threshold based classification, achieving up to 96% of accuracy in fall detection. An individual activity analysis demonstrates that most errors coincide in a few number of activities where new approaches could be focused. Finally, validation tests with elderly people significantly reduced the fall detection performance of the tested features. This validates findings of other authors and encourages developing new strategies with this new dataset as the benchmark.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,17,20173dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2017,2017-01-01 00:00:00,371,33,"Angela Sucerquia, J.

However, sepsis-associated ICU-acquired infections have not been fully characterized. The study aims to assess the risk factors and develop a model that predicts the risk of ICU-acquired infections in patients with sepsis. Methods We retrieved data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors that could predict ICU-acquired infection. We also assessed its discrimination and calibration abilities and compared them with classical score systems. Results Of 16,808 included septic patients, 2,871 (17.1%) developed ICU-acquired infection. These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725–0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 95% CI, 0.734–0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models. Conclusions ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic mortality.

However, it is controversial whether electronic automated alerts can help improve clinical outcomes of sepsis. Electronic databases are searched from inception to December 2021 for comparative effectiveness studies comparing automated alerts versus usual care for the management of sepsis. A total of 36 studies are eligible for analysis, including 6 randomized controlled trials and 30 non-randomized studies. There is significant heterogeneity in these studies concerning the study setting, design, and alerting methods. The Bayesian meta-analysis by using pooled effects of non-randomized studies as priors shows a beneficial effect of the alerting system (relative risk [RR]: 0.71; 95% credible interval: 0.62 to 0.81) in reducing mortality. The automated alerting system shows less beneficial effects in the intensive care unit (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.73–1.11) than that in the emergency department (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.51–0.90) and ward (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61–0.82). Furthermore, machine learning-based prediction methods can reduce mortality by a larger magnitude (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39–0.80) than rule-based methods (RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.63–0.85). The study shows a statistically significant beneficial effect of using the automated alerting system in the management of sepsis.

In the present study, conventional severity classification systems were compared with artificial intelligence predictive models (Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree) in terms of the prediction of the survival rate of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit. This retrospective cohort study was performed on the data of the patients admitted to the ICU of Ghaemshahr’s Razi Teaching Care Center from March 20th, 2017, to September 22nd, 2019. The required data for calculating conventional severity classification models (SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, and APACHE IV) were collected from the patients’ medical records. Subsequently, the score of each model was calculated. Artificial intelligence predictive models (Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree) were developed in the next step. Lastly, the performance of each model in predicting the survival of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit was evaluated using the criteria of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-measure, and area under the ROC curve. Also, each model was validated externally. The R program, version 4.1, was used to create the artificial intelligence models, and SPSS Statistics Software, version 21, was utilized to perform statistical analysis. The area under the ROC curve of SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, APACHE IV, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, and CART decision tree were 76.0, 77.1, 80.3, 78.5, 84.1, and 80.0, respectively. The results showed that although the APACHE II model had better results than other conventional models in predicting the survival rate of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the other conventional models provided acceptable results too. Moreover, the findings showed that the artificial neural network model had the best performance among all the studied models, indicating the discrimination power of this model in predicting patient survival compared to the other models.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,journal,['JournalArticle'],76da9cc5-c5a7-42b4-a250-3e708c5f4980,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,22,N/A,2022,2022-06-26 00:00:00,13,45,"Farzad Mirzakhani, Farahnaz Sadoughi, Mahboobeh Hatami, Alireza Amirabadizadeh","71452593, 2122338479, 145278538, 30095707",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d517fdb8911ce89b12fda685def6408c157c67e,"Computer Science, Medicine",71452593

We enrolled all patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.1.0) database from 2008 to 2019. Lasso regression was used for feature selection. Seven machine-learning methods were applied to develop the models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy and area under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to illustrate the effects of the features attributed to the model, and to analyze how the individual features affect the output of the model, and to visualize the Shapley value for a single individual. In total, 8,817 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation, the median age was 66.8 years (IQR, 55.9–77.1 years), and 3361 of 8817 participants (38.1%) were women. After selection, 25 of a total 57 clinical parameters collected on day 1 after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and were used for developing the machine-learning models. Among seven constructed models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.884 and an accuracy of 89.5% in the validation cohort. Feature importance analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, blood urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, urine output, and age were the top 5 features of the XGBoost model with the greatest impact. Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model visualized the individualized prediction of death.

HF mortality prediction is critical for developing individualized prevention and treatment plans. However, due to their lack of interpretability, most HF mortality prediction models have not yet reached clinical practice. Objective We aimed to develop an interpretable model to predict the mortality risk for patients with HF in intensive care units (ICUs) and used the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to explain the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model and explore prognostic factors for HF. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we achieved model development and performance comparison on the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). We extracted data during the first 24 hours of each ICU admission, and the data set was randomly divided, with 70% used for model training and 30% used for model validation. The prediction performance of the XGBoost model was compared with three other machine learning models by the area under the curve. We used the SHAP method to explain the XGBoost model. Results A total of 2798 eligible patients with HF were included in the final cohort for this study. The observed in-hospital mortality of patients with HF was 9.97%. Comparatively, the XGBoost model had the highest predictive performance among four models with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.824 (95% CI 0.7766-0.8708), whereas support vector machine had the poorest generalization ability (AUC=0.701, 95% CI 0.6433-0.7582). The decision curve showed that the net benefit of the XGBoost model surpassed those of other machine learning models at 10%~28% threshold probabilities. The SHAP method reveals the top 20 predictors of HF according to the importance ranking, and the average of the blood urea nitrogen was recognized as the most important predictor variable. Conclusions The interpretable predictive model helps physicians more accurately predict the mortality risk in ICU patients with HF, and therefore, provides better treatment plans and optimal resource allocation for their patients. In addition, the interpretable framework can increase the transparency of the model and facilitate understanding the reliability of the predictive model for the physicians.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],2baad992-2268-4c38-9120-e453622f2eeb,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,24,N/A,2022,2022-03-18 00:00:00,62,34,"Jili Li, Siru Liu, Yundi Hu, Lingfeng Zhu, Yujia Mao, Jialin Liu","2138211447, 48642149, 2112243737, 2118939543, 2176863427, 48210738",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/afe82f3559ff218cbc6c6e54a068be15ad7d03d8,"Computer Science, Medicine",2138211447

Red cell distribution width (RDW) to platelet ratio (RPR) is a novel inflammatory index, and its prognostic effect on critically ill patients with AKI is rarely investigated. This work is aimed at investigating the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality in these patients. Methods Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. All-cause death during hospitalization was selected as the primary outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off value, and the area under the curve (AUC) was applied to compare predictive ability among different indices. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to assess the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality. Restricted cubic spline analysis for multivariate Cox model was performed to explore the shape of the relationship between RPR and mortality. Results A total of 24,166 critically ill patients with AKI were included. The relationship of RPR and in-hospital mortality was nonlinear with a trend to rise rapidly and then gradually. For mortality prediction, RPR had the optimal cut-off value of 0.093, of which the AUC was 0.791 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.773–0.810), which was higher than those of RDW, platelet, sequential organ failure assessment score, simplified acute physiology score II, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and platelet to lymphocytes ratio. After adjustments for various confounders, high RPR showed a significant association with increased mortality with hazard ratios of 1.46 (95% CI: 1.40–1.55) for categorical variable and 1.88 (95% CI: 1.80–1.97) for continuous variables in the fully adjusted model.

Methods We involved septic patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, and these patients were categorized into crystalloids group (crystalloids alone) and early combination group (crystalloids combined albumin at 0–24 h). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We used propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust confounding and restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was conducted to quantify the beneficial effect on survival due to the combination group. Results We categorized 6597 and 920 patients in the “crystalloids alone” and “early combination”, respectively. After PSM, compared to the crystalloids group, the combination group was associated with the increased survival among 28-day (increased survival: 3.39 days, 95% CI 2.53–4.25; P  < 0.001) after ICU admission. Patients who received albumin combination at the first 24-h was associated with prolonged LOS in ICU (10.72 days vs. 8.24 days; P  < 0.001) but lower risk of 28-day mortality (12.5% vs 16.4%, P  = 0.003) than those received crystalloids alone. Conclusion In septic patients, receiving albumin combined within the first 24-h after crystalloids administration was associated with an increment of survival in 28 days.",Annals of Intensive Care,journal,['JournalArticle'],f970b1d5-df9b-4542-958b-775f51e9d3ff,Annals of Intensive Care,,11,N/A,2021,2021-03-10 00:00:00,47,48,"Shiyu Zhou, Z.

Multiple categories of fairness improving methods have been proposed for neural networks, including pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing. Our empirical study however shows that these methods are not always effective (e.g., they may improve fairness by paying the price of huge accuracy drop) or even not helpful (e.g., they may even worsen both fairness and accuracy). In this work, we propose an approach which adaptively chooses the fairness improving method based on causality analysis. That is, we choose the method based on how the neurons and attributes responsible for unfairness are distributed among the input attributes and the hidden neurons. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is effective (i.e., always identify the best fairness improving method) and efficient (i.e., with an average time overhead of 5 minutes).",ESEC/SIGSOFT FSE,Unknown,"['JournalArticle', 'Book']",Unknown,Proceedings of the 30th ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,,,Unknown,2022,2022-09-15 00:00:00,29,51,"Mengdi Zhang, Jun Sun","2162016852, 48480161",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8f4bfaca3ebf42128226182d6f303ae22d244bb,Computer Science,2162016852

The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern of their dependability and reliability. Similar to traditional decision-making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to be repaired. The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security concerns or unjust societal impacts. In this work, we address the problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to construct a neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting the given neural network's parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically, we propose CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a causality-based neural network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault localization to identify the ‘guilty’ neurons and 2) optimizes the parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior. We have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE successfully improves fairness by 61.91 % on average. For backdoor removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over 98% to less than 1 %. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation rate to less than 1 %. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based fault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of the neural networks.",International Conference on Software Engineering,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Book', 'Conference']",a36dc29e-4ea1-4567-b0fe-1c06daf8bee8,2022 IEEE/ACM 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),338-349,,2022a36dc29e-4ea1-4567-b0fe-1c06daf8bee8,2022,2022-04-20 00:00:00,73,70,"Bing-Jie Sun, Jun Sun, Hong Long Pham, Jie Shi","153182156, 2111628876, 2162960923, 2112364113",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cb0bd9f5927403bf29c3b9ccd25a79daac55194,Computer Science,153182156

Apart from the robustness and safety, fairness is also an important property that a well-designed DL system should have. To evaluate and improve individual fairness of a model, systematic test case generation for identifying individual discriminatory instances in the input space is essential. In this paper, we propose a framework EIDIG for efficiently discovering individual fairness violation. Our technique combines a global generation phase for rapidly generating a set of diverse discriminatory seeds with a local generation phase for generating as many individual discriminatory instances as possible around these seeds under the guidance of the gradient of the model output. In each phase, prior information at successive iterations is fully exploited to accelerate convergence of iterative optimization or reduce frequency of gradient calculation. Our experimental results show that, on average, our approach EIDIG generates 19.11% more individual discriminatory instances with a speedup of 121.49% when compared with the state-of-the-art method and mitigates individual discrimination by 80.03% with a limited accuracy loss after retraining.",International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis,conference,"['Book', 'JournalArticle', 'Conference']",289bfdda-eab3-4c9a-97be-ef1e0f9ddfc0,Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis,,,2021289bfdda-eab3-4c9a-97be-ef1e0f9ddfc0,2021,2021-07-11 00:00:00,36,61,"Lingfeng Zhang, Yueling Zhang, M.

One desirable property of DNN for applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e., non-discrimination). In this work, we propose a scalable approach for searching individual discriminatory instances of DNN. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only employs lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which makes it significantly more scalable than existing methods. Experimental results show that our approach explores the search space more effectively (9 times) and generates much more individual discriminatory instances (25 times) using much less time (half to 1/7).",International Conference on Software Engineering,conference,"['Book', 'JournalArticle', 'Conference']",a36dc29e-4ea1-4567-b0fe-1c06daf8bee8,2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),949-960,,2020a36dc29e-4ea1-4567-b0fe-1c06daf8bee8,2020,2020-06-27 00:00:00,120,28,"Peixin Zhang, Jingyi Wang, Jun Sun, Guoliang Dong, Xinyu Wang, Xingen Wang, J.

The most common subtype (NSMP; No Specific Molecular Profile) is assigned after exclusion of the defining features of the other three molecular subtypes and includes patients with heterogeneous clinical outcomes. In this study, we employ artificial intelligence (AI)-powered histopathology image analysis to differentiate between p53abn and NSMP EC subtypes and consequently identify a sub-group of NSMP EC patients that has markedly inferior progression-free and disease-specific survival (termed ‘p53abn-like NSMP’), in a discovery cohort of 368 patients and two independent validation cohorts of 290 and 614 from other centers. Shallow whole genome sequencing reveals a higher burden of copy number abnormalities in the ‘p53abn-like NSMP’ group compared to NSMP, suggesting that this group is biologically distinct compared to other NSMP ECs. Our work demonstrates the power of AI to detect prognostically different and otherwise unrecognizable subsets of EC where conventional and standard molecular or pathologic criteria fall short, refining image-based tumor classification.

Yet, due to their rarity and the associated testing costs, systematic screening for these mutations is not commonly pursued. Notably, the histopathological phenotype resulting from POLE mutations is theorized to resemble that of MSI. This resemblance not only could facilitate their detection by a transformer-based Deep Learning (DL) system trained on MSI pathology slides, but also indicates the possibility for MSS patients with POLE mutations to access enhanced treatment options, which might otherwise be overlooked. To harness this potential, we trained a Deep Learning classifier on a large dataset with the ground truth for microsatellite status and subsequently validated its capabilities for MSI and POLE detection across three external cohorts. Our model accurately identified MSI status in both the internal and external resection cohorts using pathology images alone. Notably, with a classification threshold of 0.5, over 75% of POLE driver mutant patients in the external resection cohorts were flagged as “positive” by a DL system trained on MSI status. In a clinical setting, deploying this DL model as a preliminary screening tool could facilitate the efficient identification of clinically relevant MSI and POLE mutations in colorectal tumors, in one go.",npj Precision Oncology,,['JournalArticle'],adf0b60b-d3a4-4ec1-b1a1-04313d832403,NPJ Precision Oncology,,8,Unknown,2024,2024-05-23 00:00:00,5,62,"M.

However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge—the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers—to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted κ, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840–0.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835–0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials.

Automatically learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer types. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal aneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological subtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates.

The necessity for effective security actions are more crucial than ever before due to the increasingly complex nature of cybersecurity attacks. Using encryption approaches and algorithms is one of the best ways to secure more sensitive data from cyber-attacks. In order to effectively defend against cybersecurity assaults, this research study attempts to give an analysis of the function that encryption methods and approaches serve. We investigate various encryption algorithms and techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and their applications. In addition, we investigate the difficulties of encryption and the potential solutions to these difficulties.",VAWKUM Transactions on Computer Sciences,,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",96e438a9-c85c-4407-ae7d-76be696f56f7,VAWKUM Transactions on Computer Sciences,,,Unknown,2023,2023-06-30 00:00:00,7,14,"S.

0dd67335d80194e7ccf6c0ed275622bf60e5edce,10.3390/su14127375,Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Malicious Domains Detection Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),"With the expansion of the internet, a major threat has emerged involving the spread of malicious domains intended by attackers to perform illegal activities aiming to target governments, violating privacy of organizations, and even manipulating everyday users. Therefore, detecting these harmful domains is necessary to combat the growing network attacks. Machine Learning (ML) models have shown significant outcomes towards the detection of malicious domains. However, the “black box” nature of the complex ML models obstructs their wide-ranging acceptance in some of the fields. The emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has successfully incorporated the interpretability and explicability in the complex models. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI model has enabled the interpretability without affecting the performance of the models. This study aimed to propose an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model to detect malicious domains on a recent dataset containing 45,000 samples of malicious and non-malicious domains. In the current study, initially several interpretable ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB), and black box ensemble models, such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), AdaBoost (AB), and Cat Boost (CB) algorithms, were implemented and found that XGB outperformed the other classifiers. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI global surrogate model (Shapley additive explanations) and local surrogate LIME were used to generate the explanation of the XGB prediction. Two sets of experiments were performed; initially the model was executed using a preprocessed dataset and later with selected features using the Sequential Forward Feature selection algorithm. The results demonstrate that ML algorithms were able to distinguish benign and malicious domains with overall accuracy ranging from 0.8479 to 0.9856. The ensemble classifier XGB achieved the highest result, with an AUC and accuracy of 0.9991 and 0.9856, respectively, before the feature selection algorithm, while there was an AUC of 0.999 and accuracy of 0.9818 after the feature selection algorithm. The proposed model outperformed the benchmark study.",Sustainability,journal,,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-16 00:00:00,37,28,"Nida Aslam, Irfan Ullah Khan, Samiha Mirza, Alanoud Alowayed, Fatima M.

8bdb4900b207c7b1f5cfd5dd4752997f9765e738,10.3390/fi13120309,DNS Firewall Based on Machine Learning,"Nowadays there are many DNS firewall solutions to prevent users accessing malicious domains. These can provide real-time protection and block illegitimate communications, contributing to the cybersecurity posture of the organizations. Most of these solutions are based on known malicious domain lists that are being constantly updated. However, in this way, it is only possible to block malicious communications for known malicious domains, leaving out many others that are malicious but have not yet been updated in the blocklists. This work provides a study to implement a DNS firewall solution based on ML and so improve the detection of malicious domain requests on the fly. For this purpose, a dataset with 34 features and 90 k records was created based on real DNS logs. The data were enriched using OSINT sources. Exploratory analysis and data preparation steps were carried out, and the final dataset submitted to different Supervised ML algorithms to accurately and quickly classify if a domain request is malicious or not. The results show that the ML algorithms were able to classify the benign and malicious domains with accuracy rates between 89% and 96%, and with a classification time between 0.01 and 3.37 s. The contributions of this study are twofold. In terms of research, a dataset was made public and the methodology can be used by other researchers. In terms of solution, the work provides the baseline to implement an in band DNS firewall.",Future Internet,journal,['JournalArticle'],c3e5f1c8-9ba7-47e5-acde-53063a69d483,Future Internet,309,13,N/A,2021,2021-11-30 00:00:00,11,45,"Cláudio Marques, Silvestre Malta, J.

Currently, NMTF learns a representation of a dataset through an optimization procedure that typically uses multiplicative update rules. This procedure has had limited success, and its failure cases have not been well understood. We here perform an empirical study involving six large datasets comparing multiplicative update rules with three alternative optimization methods, including alternating least squares, projected gradients, and coordinate descent. We find that methods based on projected gradients and coordinate descent converge up to twenty-four times faster than multiplicative update rules. Furthermore, alternating least squares method can quickly train NMTF models on sparse datasets but often fails on dense datasets. Coordinate descent-based NMTF converges up to sixteen times faster compared to well-established methods.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,14,N/A,2019,2019-06-11 00:00:00,20,46,"Andrej Čopar, B.

However, it is time-consuming and costly to determine DTIs experimentally. Over the past decade, various computational methods were proposed to predict potential DTIs with high efficiency and low costs. These methods can be roughly divided into several categories, such as molecular docking-based, pharmacophore-based, similarity-based, machine learning-based, and network-based methods. Among them, network-based methods, which do not rely on three-dimensional structures of targets and negative samples, have shown great advantages over the others. In this article, we focused on network-based methods for DTI prediction, in particular our network-based inference (NBI) methods that were derived from recommendation algorithms. We first introduced the methodologies and evaluation of network-based methods, and then the emphasis was put on their applications in a wide range of fields, including target prediction and elucidation of molecular mechanisms of therapeutic effects or safety problems. Finally, limitations and perspectives of network-based methods were discussed. In a word, network-based methods provide alternative tools for studies in drug repurposing, new drug discovery, systems pharmacology and systems toxicology.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",84a6a8b4-8e85-48bd-b65e-a83d83f95908,Frontiers in Pharmacology,,9,N/A,2018,2018-10-09 00:00:00,151,126,"Zengrui Wu, Weihua Li, Guixia Liu, Yun Tang","2299649, 39741916, 2116296369, 48066368",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ab586c427a1890932bd27fa6c89fa9875d11a05,"Computer Science, Medicine",2299649

The objective of this mixed research is to analyze the impact of the flipped classroom in the teaching-learning process on statistics considering data science and machine learning (linear regression). The sample consists of 61 students who took the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course during the 2018 school year. This research proposes the consultation of the YouTube videos before the class, performance of the collaborative exercises and use of the spreadsheet to check the results during the class and performance of the laboratory practices through the spreadsheet after the class. The results of machine learning (70%, 80% and 90% of training) indicate that the participation of the students before, during and after the class positively influences the assimilation of knowledge and development of mathematical skills about the frequencies and measures of central tendency. On the other hand, the decision tree technique identifies 6 predictive models on the use of the flipped classroom. Also, the students of the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course are motivated and satisfied to use the technological tools in the Introduction to statistics Unit.

Methods Eighty second- and third-year undergraduates in Lanzhou University were recruited and randomized to either three experimental groups or one control group. The subjects undertook theoretical examinations to test their basic level of knowledge after training in similarly unified knowledge courses. Each student group then participated in an eight-hour operating training session. An operation test on pig mandible was conducted, followed by a second theoretical examination. The assessment consists of three distinct parts: a subjective operating score by a clinical senior teacher, an implant accuracy analysis in cone-beam computed tomography (angular, apical, and entrance deviation), and comparison of the two theoretical examinations. Finally, students completed a questionnaire gauging their understanding of the virtual simulation. Results There was no significant difference between the four groups in first theoretical examination ( P  > 0.05); the second theoretical scores of the V-J and J-V group (62.90 ± 3.70, 60.05 ± 2.73) were significantly higher than the first time (57.05 ± 3.92, P  < 0.05), while no difference between the V (57.10 ± 3.66) and J (56.89 ± 2.67) groups was found. Thus, the combination of V-J was effective in improving students’ theoretical scores. The V-J and J-V groups had higher scores on operation (73.98 ± 4.58, 71.85 ± 4.67) and showed better implant precision. Conclusion Virtual simulation education, especially with a jaw simulation model, could improve students’ implantology achievements and training.

To investigate the effect of flipped classroom approach on teaching evidence-based medicine to medical technology students, we conducted a tailor-made six flipped classroom based EBM courses for medical technology students. This study adopted a qusai-experimental design with 62 medical technology interns as the research object. Students in the experimental group attended the flipped classroom course, while students in the control group attended the traditional course. The learning outcomes were evaluated by Fresno test in both groups. Furthermore, to understand student’s perceptions on the flipped classroom approach, students in the experimental group were required to fill in a satisfaction survey and answer some open-ended questions. The Fresno test scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than that of the control group. From the results of the satisfaction survey, we know that students were satisfied with this course format. Students claimed that the flipped classroom approach could improve their learning efficiency and the interactions with teacher could help them to think more deeply. To conclude, most students showed positive attitudes and views on flipped classroom strategy.

Machine learning based techniques, in particular deep neural networks, can provide a viable alternative to maximum-likelihood methods. However, most common neural network architectures were developed for other domains such as image recogntion. While these methods can enhance the reconstruction performance in IceCube, there is much potential for tailored techniques. In the typical physics use-case, many symmetries, invariances and prior knowledge exist in the data, which are not fully exploited by current network architectures. Novel and specialized deep learning based reconstruction techniques are desired which can leverage the physics potential of experiments like IceCube.
A reconstruction method using convolutional neural networks is presented which can significantly increase the reconstruction accuracy while greatly reducing the runtime in comparison to standard reconstruction methods in Ice- Cube. In addition, first results are discussed for future developments based on generative neural networks.",EPJ Web of Conferences,journal,['Conference'],f2cc63fa-90cb-413d-92ce-003d5244a1e8,EPJ Web of Conferences,,,N/A,2019,2019-10-01 00:00:00,10,10,Mirco Hünnefeld,8185612,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b5378514457d040b7f8299d3799d25786e190e2,"Computer Science, Physics",8185612

This three-dimensional array of light sensors allows the observation of time and spatial variations of the ambient light field. We report on observation of an increase of luminescence activity in 2016 and 2018. On the contrary, we observed practically constant optical noise in 2017. An agreement has been found between two independent optical noise data sets.

Deep neural networks can be extremely powerful and their usage is computationally inexpensive once the networks are trained. 
While the main bottleneck for deep neural networks in the traditional domain of image classification is the lack of sufficient labeled data, this usually does not apply to physics where millions of Monte Carlo simulations exist. 
 
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a Cherenkov detector deep in the Antarctic ice where the reconstruction of muon-neutrino events is one of the key challenges. 
Due to limited computational resources and the high data rate, only simplified reconstructions limited to a small subset of data can be run on-site at the South Pole. 
However, in order to perform online analysis and to issue real-time alerts, a fast and powerful reconstruction is necessary. 
 
This paper demonstrates how deep learning techniques such as those used in image recognition can be applied to IceCube pulses in order to reconstruct muon-neutrino events. 
These methods can be generalized to other physics experiments.",,Unknown,,Unknown,,1057,301,Unknown,2017,2017-08-16 00:00:00,20,3,Mirco Hünnefeld,8185612,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72ea53f9972e8346b728dc0474df3b081e1795b5,Physics,8185612

Similar to the 2015 task, the goal of the shared task is to identify individual discourse relations that are present in natural language text. Given a natural language text, participating teams are asked to locate the discourse connectives (explicit or implicit) and their arguments as well as predicting the sense of the discourse connectives. Based on the success of the previous year, we continued to ask participants to deploy their systems on TIRA, a web-based platform on which participants can run their systems on the test data for evaluation. This evaluation methodology preserves the integrity of the shared task. We have also made a few changes and additions in the 2016 shared task based on the feedback from 2015. The first is that teams could choose to carry out the task on Chinese texts, or English texts, or both. We have also allowed participants to focus on parts of the shared task (rather than the whole thing) as a typical system requires substantial investment of effort. Finally, we have modified the scorer so that it can report results based on partial matches of the arguments. 23 teams participated in this year’s shared task, using a wide variety of approaches.

However, there are important linguistic differences between explicit and implicit discourse relations, which limit the accuracy of such an approach. We account for these differences by applying techniques from domain adaptation, treating implicitly and explicitly-marked discourse relations as separate domains. The distribution of surface features varies across these two domains, so we apply a marginalized denoising autoencoder to induce a dense, domain-general representation. The label distribution is also domain-specific, so we apply a resampling technique that is similar to instance weighting. In combination with a set of automatically-labeled data, these improvements eliminate more than 80% of the transfer loss incurred by training an implicit discourse relation classifier on explicitly-marked discourse relations.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",41bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,,2219-2224,,201541bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,2015,2015-09-01 00:00:00,30,25,"Yangfeng Ji, Gongbo Zhang, Jacob Eisenstein","40608686, 2115982376, 144154709",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b8d7847251fa73e78e0cad9ef78e25490345539,"Computer Science, Linguistics, Mathematics",40608686

Instead of depending on mostly hand-engineered sparse features and independent components for each subtask, we propose a unified approach completely based on deep learning architectures. To train more expressive representations that capture communicative functions and semantic roles of discourse units and relations between them, we will jointly learn all discourse parsing subtasks at different layers of our architecture and share their intermediate representations.

Studies have focused on chemical analysis of biofluids for PMI estimation; however, no reports using spectroscopic methods in pericardial fluid (PF) are available. In this study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory was applied to collect comprehensive biochemical information from rabbit PF at different PMIs. The PMI-dependent spectral signature was determined by two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis. The partial least square (PLS) and nu-support vector machine (nu-SVM) models were then established based on the acquired spectral dataset. Spectral variables associated with amide I, amide II, COO−, C-H bending, and C-O or C-OH vibrations arising from proteins, polypeptides, amino acids and carbohydrates, respectively, were susceptible to PMI in 2D correlation analysis. Moreover, the nu-SVM model appeared to achieve a more satisfactory prediction than the PLS model in calibration; the reliability of both models was determined in an external validation set.

Temperature is believed to be the most important and can be connected to decomposition by using the accumulated degree days (ADD). The aim of this research was to develop a decomposition scoring method and to develop a formula to estimate the PMI by using the developed decomposition scoring method and ADD.A decomposition scoring method and a Book of Reference (visual resource) were made. Ninety-one cases were used to develop a method to estimate the PMI. The photographs were scored using the decomposition scoring method. The temperature data was provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. The PMI was estimated using the total decomposition score (TDS) and using the TDS and ADD. The latter required an additional step, namely to calculate the ADD from the finding date back until the predicted day of death.The developed decomposition scoring method had a high interrater reliability. The TDS significantly estimates the PMI (R2 = 0.67 and 0.80 for indoor and outdoor bodies, respectively). When using the ADD, the R2 decreased to 0.66 and 0.56.The developed decomposition scoring method is a practical method to measure decomposition for human remains found on land. The PMI can be estimated using this method, but caution is advised in cases with a long PMI. The ADD does not account for all the heat present in a decomposing remain and is therefore a possible bias.",Zeitschrift für Rechtsmedizin,journal,"['Study', 'JournalArticle']",dd627ab5-e30c-4f0d-b7d9-7faae870f6f0,International Journal of Legal Medicine,863 - 873,132,N/A,2017,2017-11-06 00:00:00,55,57,"H.

Medicolegal scholars and forensic pathologists around the world have studied the estimation of PMI extensively in the past, and many novel methods and advanced technologies have now been applied in the field. For several centuries, Chinese forensic examiners have also worked on the estimation of the PMI, and there are a large number of excellent studies published in Chinese rather than in English, and these are not easily accessible or known internationally. Therefore we have conducted a review of relevant studies published by Chinese forensic scholars in the last few decades. The scope of this review is to provide a concise summary of the current progress in the estimation of PMI by Chinese forensic researchers using molecular biology, spectroscopic technology, entomological methods, energy changes, thanatochemistry and other methods.",Forensic Sciences Research,,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",ad478986-4132-43ac-8236-97713bf054b7,Forensic sciences research,3 - 13,1,Unknown,2016,2016-11-25 00:00:00,37,114,"Chengzhi Li, Qi Wang, Yinming Zhang, Han-cheng Lin, Ji Zhang, P.

However, most of the applied methods have practical limitations or provide insufficient results under certain circumstances. Thus, new methods that can easily be implemented into forensic routine work are required to deliver more and discrete information about the postmortem interval (PMI). Following a previous work on skeletal muscle degradation in the porcine model, we analyzed human postmortem skeletal muscle samples of 40 forensic cases by Western blotting and casein zymography. Our results demonstrate predictable protein degradation processes in human muscle that are distinctly associated with temperature and the PMI. We provide information on promising degradation markers for certain periods of time postmortem, which can be useful tools for time since death delimitation. In addition, we discuss external influencing factors such as age, body mass index, sex, and cause of death that need to be considered in future routine application of the method in humans.",Zeitschrift für Rechtsmedizin,journal,['JournalArticle'],dd627ab5-e30c-4f0d-b7d9-7faae870f6f0,International Journal of Legal Medicine,1547 - 1555,130,N/A,2016,2016-03-07 00:00:00,68,36,"S.

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.",bioRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,PLoS ONE,,15,N/A,2020,2020-02-04 00:00:00,496,110,"Gurjit S.

The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) of the Sentinel-3 satellites program is capable of providing images for the monitoring of such waters. Atmospheric correction is a necessary process in order to retrieve the desired surface-leaving radiance signal and several atmospheric correction methods have been developed through the years. However, many of these correction methods require programming language skills, or function as commercial software plugins, limiting their possibility of use by end users. Accordingly, in this study, the free SNAP software provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to evaluate the possible differences between a partial atmospheric correction method accounting for Rayleigh scattering and a full atmospheric correction method (iCOR), applied on Sentinel-3 OLCI images of a shallow, highly eutrophic water reservoir. For the complete evaluation of the two methods, in addition to the comparison of the band reflectance values, chlorophyll (CHL) and cyanobacteria (CI) indices were also calculated and their values were intercompared. The results showed, that although the absolute values between the two correction methods did not coincide, there was a very good correlation between the two methods for both bands’ reflectance (r > 0.73) and the CHL and CI indices values (r > 0.95). Therefore, since iCOR correction image processing time is 25 times longer than Rayleigh correction, it is proposed that the Rayleigh partial correction method may be alternatively used for seasonal water monitoring, especially in cases of long time-series, enhancing time and resources use efficiency. Further comparisons of the two methods in other inland water bodies and evaluation with in situ chlorophyll and cyanobacteria measurements will enhance the applicability of the methodology.",PeerJ,journal,['JournalArticle'],558a3215-8ffd-4b31-be7f-f653ca3b600d,PeerJ,,10,N/A,2022,2022-11-04 00:00:00,4,54,"Stefanos Katsoulis-Dimitriou, Marios Lefkaditis, Sotirios Barmpagiannakos, K.

4cc2b4dac85c7523287e4c86eb6fb1ecf5abb4da,10.1071/mf21081,Climate change and cyanobacteria harmful algae blooms: adaptation practices for developing countries,"Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are increasingly being reported worldwide owing to several reasons, including widespread eutrophication and enhanced scientific monitoring. Catchment and water management, organisations, industry, farmers and local governments are all confronting the effects of climate change, which stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria and affect the efficacy of adaptation measures in water systems. To tackle climate change and CyanoHABs growth, actors at different levels require both ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ assessments to help them in formulating and implementing adaptation measures. Potential solutions must also be assessed locally to limit associated adverse effects, in particular, negative effects on water quality. Thus, having a better understanding of the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between adaptation practices and climate-change effects on CyanoHABs makes a valuable contribution to a more integrated climate policy and the effective climate-proofing of our water bodies. This article examines adaptation practices focused on tackling CyanoHABs occurrence in a changing climate. It fills an important gap between a major environmental problem and potential solutions. The practices and measures advanced as a result of the analysis can be used by persons with different expertise and skill levels for improving the relevant institutional frameworks and policies to protect their local water bodies.",Marine and Freshwater Research,journal,,685bc85c-a614-4c26-be69-3ba06cb999c9,Marine and Freshwater Research,,,N/A,2021,2021-08-26 00:00:00,8,111,"A.

Cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence, global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. CyanoHABs are regulated by synergistic effects of nutrient (nitrogen:N and phosphorus:P) supplies, light, temperature, vertical stratification, water residence times, and biotic interactions. In most instances, nutrient control strategies should focus on reducing both N and P inputs. Strategies based on physical, chemical (nutrient) and biological manipulations can be effective in reducing CyanoHABs; however, these strategies are largely confined to relatively small systems, and some are prone to ecological and environmental drawbacks, including enhancing release of cyanotoxins, disruption of planktonic and benthic communities and fisheries habitat. All strategies should consider and be adaptive to climatic variability and change in order to be effective for long-term control of CyanoHABs. Rising temperatures and greater hydrologic variability will increase growth rates and alter critical nutrient thresholds for CyanoHAB development; thus, nutrient reductions for bloom control may need to be more aggressively pursued in response to climatic changes globally.",Life,Unknown,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",Unknown,Life,988 - 1012,4,Unknown,2014,2014-12-01 00:00:00,251,120,H.

The performance of these intelligent systems is based on information transfer in the context of information technology, so reported data from network should be managed to avoid the malicious activities that including the issues that could affect the quality of service the system. In this paper for control of the reported data and to ensure the veracity of the obtained information, using intrusion detection system is proposed based on the support vector machine and principle component analysis (PCA) to recognize and identify the intrusions and attacks in the smart grid. Here, the operation of intrusion detection systems for different kernel of SVM when using support vector machine (SVM) and PCA simultaneously is studied. To evaluate the algorithm, based on data KDD99, numerical simulation is done on five different kernels for an intrusion detection system using support vector machine with PCA simultaneously. Also comparison analysis is investigated for presented intrusion detection algorithm in terms of time - response, rate of increase network efficiency and increase system error and differences in the use or lack of use PCA. The results indicate that correct detection rate and the rate of attack error detection have best value when PCA is used, and when the core of algorithm is radial type, in SVM algorithm reduces the time for data analysis and enhances performance of intrusion detection.",,Unknown,,Unknown,International Journal on Cybernetics & Informatics,1-9,3,Unknown,2014,2014-08-31 00:00:00,4,17,"Sara Pourfallah, A.

Recently, as deep learning models have become more common, RNNs have been used to forecast increasingly complicated systems. Dynamical spatio-temporal processes represent a class of complex systems that can potentially benefit from these types of models. Although the RNN literature is expansive and highly developed, uncertainty quantification is often ignored. Even when considered, the uncertainty is generally quantified without the use of a rigorous framework, such as a fully Bayesian setting. Here we attempt to quantify uncertainty in a more formal framework while maintaining the forecast accuracy that makes these models appealing, by presenting a Bayesian RNN model for nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting. Additionally, we make simple modifications to the basic RNN to help accommodate the unique nature of nonlinear spatio-temporal data. The proposed model is applied to a Lorenz simulation and two real-world nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting applications.",Entropy,journal,['JournalArticle'],8270cfe1-3713-4325-a7bd-c6a87eed889e,Entropy,,21,N/A,2017,2017-11-02 00:00:00,96,70,"Patrick L.

However, the intermittent and unstable nature of PM2.5 concentration series makes its forecasting become a very difficult task. In order to improve the forecast accuracy of PM2.5 concentration, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on wavelet transform (WT), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and back propagation (BP) neural network optimized by differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Firstly, WT is employed to disassemble the PM2.5 concentration series into a number of subsets with different frequencies. Secondly, VMD is applied to decompose each subset into a set of variational modes (VMs). Thirdly, DE-BP model is utilized to forecast all the VMs. Fourthly, the forecast value of each subset is obtained through aggregating the forecast results of all the VMs obtained from VMD decomposition of this subset. Finally, the final forecast series of PM2.5 concentration is obtained by adding up the forecast values of all subsets. Two PM2.5 concentration series collected from Wuhan and Tianjin, respectively, located in China are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms all the other considered models in this paper.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],3096eb5c-d18c-4877-94cd-28edd3a9c357,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,14,N/A,2017,2017-07-01 00:00:00,33,45,"Deyun Wang, Yanling Liu, Hongyuan Luo, Chenqiang Yue, Sheng Cheng","51327731, 2143096740, 48541761, 50768886, 2111151448",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1ea839f94c1a492baa80ac39bf0a5885b0e789e,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science, Medicine",51327731

Patients with LABC from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiomics features were extracted from enhanced MRI. We constructed the radiomics score using lasso and assessed its prognostic value. An external validation cohort from The Cancer Imaging Archive was used to assess phenotype reproducibility. Sequencing data from TCGA and our center were applied to reveal genomic landscape of different radiomics score groups. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes map and bioinformatics methods were applied to evaluate the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment. Computational histopathology was also applied. A total of 278 patients were divided into training cohort and validation cohort. Radiomics score was constructed and significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients in training cohort, validation cohort and external validation cohort (p < 0.001, p = 0.014 and p = 0.041, respectively). The radiomics-based nomogram showed better predictive performance of DFS compared with TNM model. Distinct gene expression patterns were identified. Immunophenotype and immune cell composition was different in each radiomics score group. The link between radiomics and computational histopathology was revealed. The radiomics score could effectively predict prognosis of LABC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Despite PD-L1 expression being the standard biomarker used before the start of therapy, there is still a strict need to identify complementary non-invasive biomarkers in order to better select patients. In this context, radiomics is an emerging approach for examining medical images and clinical data by capturing multiple features hidden from human eye and is potentially able to predict response assessment and survival in the course of immunotherapy. We reviewed the available studies investigating the role of radiomics in cancer patients, focusing on non-small cell lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although preliminary research shows encouraging results, different issues need to be solved before radiomics can enter into clinical practice. Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have demonstrated encouraging results in terms of durable clinical benefit and survival in several malignancies. Nevertheless, the search to identify an “ideal” biomarker for predicting response to ICI is still far from over. Radiomics is a new translational field of study aiming to extract, by dedicated software, several features from a given medical image, ranging from intensity distribution and spatial heterogeneity to higher-order statistical parameters. Based on these premises, our review aims to summarize the current status of radiomics as a potential predictor of clinical response following immunotherapy treatment. A comprehensive search of PubMed results was conducted. All studies published in English up to and including December 2021 were selected, comprising those that explored computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) for radiomic analyses in the setting of ICI. Several studies have demonstrated the potential applicability of radiomic features in the monitoring of the therapeutic response beyond the traditional morphologic and metabolic criteria, as well as in the prediction of survival or non-invasive assessment of the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, important limitations emerge from our review in terms of standardization in feature selection, data sharing, and methods, as well as in external validation. Additionally, there is still need for prospective clinical trials to confirm the potential significant role of radiomics during immunotherapy.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",7fe84005-586f-4604-98ee-fa60fe8ae618,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,11,N/A,2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,18,68,"A.

A prior validation of the immunoscore for breast cancer (ISBC) was made on the basis of a systematic assessment of immune landscapes extrapolated from a large number of neoplastic transcripts. Our goal was to develop a non-invasive radiomics-based ISBC predictive factor. Methods Immunocell fractions of 22 different categories were evaluated using CIBERSORT on the basis of a large, open breast cancer cohort derived from comprehensive information on gene expression. The ISBC was constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model derived from the Immunocell type scores, with 479 quantified features in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions as observed from DCE-MRI. A radiomics signature [radiomics ImmunoScore (RIS)] was developed for the prediction of ISBC using a random forest machine-learning algorithm, and we further evaluated its relationship with prognosis. Results An ISBC consisting of seven different immune cells was established through the use of a LASSO model. Multivariate analyses showed that the ISBC was an independent risk factor in prognosis (HR=2.42, with a 95% CI of 1.49–3.93; P<0.01). A radiomic signature of 21 features of the ISBC was then exploited and validated (the areas under the curve [AUC] were 0.899 and 0.815). We uncovered statistical associations between the RIS signature with recurrence-free and overall survival rates (both P<0.05). Conclusions The RIS is a valuable instrument with which to assess the immunoscore, and offers important implications for the prognosis of breast cancer.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,12,N/A,2022,2022-01-03 00:00:00,29,38,"Xiaorui Han, W.

This pilot study shows that radiomics analysis coupled with machine learning of DCE-MRI is a promising approach to derive prognostic and predictive information and to select patients who could benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. This technique could also be used to monitor PD-L1 expression, as it can vary over time and between different regions of the tumor, thus avoiding repeated biopsies. Abstract The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess whether radiomics analysis coupled with machine learning (ML) based on standard-of-care dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can predict PD-L1 expression status in patients with triple negative breast cancer, and to compare the performance of this approach with radiologist review. Patients with biopsy-proven triple negative breast cancer who underwent pre-treatment breast MRI and whose PD-L1 status was available were included. Following 3D tumor segmentation and extraction of radiomic features, radiomic features with significant differences between PD-L1+ and PD-L1− patients were determined, and a final predictive model to predict PD-L1 status was developed using a coarse decision tree and five-fold cross-validation. Separately, all lesions were qualitatively assessed by two radiologists independently according to the BI-RADS lexicon. Of 62 women (mean age 47, range 31–81), 27 had PD-L1− tumors and 35 had PD-L1+ tumors. The final radiomics model to predict PD-L1 status utilized three MRI parameters, i.e., variance (FO), run length variance (RLM), and large zone low grey level emphasis (LZLGLE), for a sensitivity of 90.7%, specificity of 85.1%, and diagnostic accuracy of 88.2%. There were no significant associations between qualitative assessed DCE-MRI imaging features and PD-L1 status. Thus, radiomics analysis coupled with ML based on standard-of-care DCE-MRI is a promising approach to derive prognostic and predictive information and to select patients who could benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.",Cancers,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",d30776c0-e524-4f14-a524-871d0586862c,Cancers,,13,N/A,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,16,52,"Roberto Lo Gullo, H.

The immunological components within tumors, termed the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), have long been shown to be strongly related to tumor development, recurrence and metastasis. However, conventional studies that underestimate the potential value of the spatial architecture of the TIME are unable to completely elucidate its complexity. As innovative high-flux and high-dimensional technologies emerge, researchers can more feasibly and accurately detect and depict the spatial architecture of the TIME. These findings have improved our understanding of the complexity and role of the TIME in tumor biology. In this review, we first epitomized some representative emerging technologies in the study of the spatial architecture of the TIME and categorized the description methods used to characterize these structures. Then, we determined the functions of the spatial architecture of the TIME in tumor biology and the effects of the gradient of extracellular nonspecific chemicals (ENSCs) on the TIME. We also discussed the potential clinical value of our understanding of the spatial architectures of the TIME, as well as current limitations and future prospects in this novel field.

Thus, new anti-ASFV drugs need to be urgently identified. Recently, we identified pentagastrin as a potential antiviral drug against ASFVs using molecular docking and machine learning models. However, the scoring functions are easily influenced by properties of protein pockets, resulting in a scoring bias. Here, we employed the 5′-P binding pocket of AsfvPolX as a potential binding site to identify antiviral drugs and classified 13 AsfvPolX structures into three classes based on pocket parameters calculated by the SiteMap module. We then applied principal component analysis to eliminate this scoring bias, which was effective in making the SP Glide score more balanced between 13 AsfvPolX structures in the dataset. As a result, we identified cangrelor and fostamatinib as potential antiviral drugs against ASFVs. Furthermore, the classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein can provide an alternative approach to identify novel antiviral drugs by optimizing the scoring function of the docking programs. Here, we report a machine learning-based novel approach to generate high binding affinity compounds that are individually matched to the available classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,22,N/A,2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,6,34,"Jiwon Choi, D.

Each layer possesses many proteins, but very few of the proteins have been investigated at a structural level. Here, we concluded all the ASFV proteins whose structures were unveiled, and explained their functions from the view of structures. Those structures include ASFV AP endonuclease, dUTPases (E165R), pS273R protease, core shell proteins p15 and p35, non-structural proteins pA151R, pNP868R (RNA guanylyltransferase), major capsid protein p72 (gene B646L), Bcl-2-like protein A179L, histone-like protein pA104R, sulfhydryl oxidase pB119L, polymerase X and ligase.

Currently known flavonoids with anti-ASFV activity demonstrate a wide range of antiviral mechanisms, which motivates exploration of new antiviral candidates within this class. The objective of this study was to determine whether other flavonoids may significantly inhibit ASFV infection in vitro. We performed a cell-based library screen of 90 flavonoids. Our screening method allowed us to track the development of virus-induced cytopathic effect by MTT in the presence of tested flavonoids. This screening method was shown to be robust for hit identification, with an average Z-factor of 0.683. We identified nine compounds that inhibit ASFV Ba71V strain in Vero cells. Among them, kaempferol was the most potent and exhibited dose-dependent inhibition, which occurred through a virostatic effect. Time-of-addition studies revealed that kaempferol acts on the entry and post-entry stages of the ASFV replication cycle and impairs viral protein and DNA synthesis. It was further identified that kaempferol induces autophagy in ASFV-infected Vero cells, which is related to its antiviral activity and could be partially abrogated by the addition of an autophagy inhibitor. Kaempferol also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of a highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate in porcine macrophages. Together, these findings support that kaempferol is a promising anti-ASFV agent and has a distinct antiviral mechanism compared to other anti-ASFV flavonoids.",Frontiers in Microbiology,journal,['JournalArticle'],25a655e4-17da-4bfc-a246-5cd20202068d,Frontiers in Microbiology,,12,N/A,2021,2021-10-21 00:00:00,30,54,"E.

Since the first diagnosed ASF case in China on August 3, 2018, it has caused huge economic losses to animal husbandry. ASF is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), which is the only member of Asfarviridae family. ASFV is and the only insect-borne DNA virus belonging to the Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) family with an icosahedral structure and an envelope. Till date, there are still no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs for the prevention or treatment of ASF. The complex viral genome and its sophisticated ability to regulate the host immune response may be the reason for the difficulty in developing an effective vaccine. This review summarizes the recent findings on ASFV structure, the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection and immunosuppression, and ASFV-encoded proteins to provide comprehensive proteomic information for basic research on ASFV. In addition, it also analyzes the results of previous studies and speculations on the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection, which aids the study of the mechanism of clinical pathological phenomena, and provides a possible direction for an intensive study of ASFV infection mechanism.

Here, an up-to-date set of protein–protein interactions between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of protein–protein interactions from multiple sources. Thirty-eight swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as ASFV-interacting swine proteins. The ASFV-interacting swine proteins were found to play a central role in the swine protein–protein interaction network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of ASFV-interacting swine proteins also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on ASFV-interacting swine proteins were identified, such as Polaprezinc and Geldanamycin.

In this work, we show how deep learning can be used to advance the research field of photochemistry by learning all important properties—multiple energies, forces, and different couplings—for photodynamics simulations. We simplify such simulations substantially by (i) a phase-free training skipping costly preprocessing of raw quantum chemistry data; (ii) rotationally covariant nonadiabatic couplings, which can either be trained or (iii) alternatively be approximated from only ML potentials, their gradients, and Hessians; and (iv) incorporating spin–orbit couplings. As the deep-learning method, we employ SchNet with its automatically determined representation of molecular structures and extend it for multiple electronic states. In combination with the molecular dynamics program SHARC, our approach termed SchNarc is tested on two polyatomic molecules and paves the way toward efficient photodynamics simulations of complex systems.",Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,journal,['JournalArticle'],45c7ef3c-e436-428b-a856-c8d5b31b603b,The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,3828 - 3834,11,N/A,2020,2020-02-17 00:00:00,128,121,"Julia Westermayr, M.

However, this approach has been less effective at producing competent players in general-sum games or those with more than two players than in two-player, zero-sum games. An appealing alternative is to consider adaptive algorithms that ensure strong performance in hindsight relative to what could have been achieved with modified behavior. This approach also leads to a game-theoretic analysis, but in the correlated play that arises from joint learning dynamics rather than factored agent behavior at equilibrium. We develop and advocate for this hindsight rationality framing of learning in general sequential decision-making settings. To this end, we re-examine mediated equilibrium and deviation types in extensive-form games, thereby gaining a more complete understanding and resolving past misconceptions. We present a set of examples illustrating the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each type of equilibrium in the literature, and prove that no tractable concept subsumes all others. This line of inquiry culminates in the definition of the deviation and equilibrium classes that correspond to algorithms in the counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) family, relating them to all others in the literature. Examining CFR in greater detail further leads to a new recursive definition of rationality in correlated play that extends sequential rationality in a way that naturally applies to hindsight evaluation.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405,ArXiv,,abs/2012.05874,2020bdc2e585-4e48-4e36-8af1-6d859763d405,2020,2020-12-10 00:00:00,26,37,"Dustin Morrill, Ryan D'Orazio, Reca Sarfati, Marc Lanctot, James Wright, A.

However, the pervasiveness of web browsing in our daily life does not come without security risks. This widespread practice of web browsing in combination with web users’ low situational awareness against cyber attacks, exposes them to a variety of threats, such as phishing, malware and profiling. Phishing attacks can compromise a target, individual or enterprise, through social interaction alone. Moreover, in the current threat landscape phishing attacks typically serve as an attack vector or initial step in a more complex campaign. To make matters worse, past work has demonstrated the inability of denylists, which are the default phishing countermeasure, to protect users from the dynamic nature of phishing URLs. In this context, our work uses supervised machine learning to block phishing attacks, based on a novel combination of features that are extracted solely from the URL. We evaluate our performance over time with a dataset which consists of active phishing attacks and compare it with Google Safe Browsing (GSB), i.e., the default security control in most popular web browsers. We find that our work outperforms GSB in all of our experiments, as well as performs well even against phishing URLs which are active one year after our model’s training.",Future Internet,journal,['JournalArticle'],c3e5f1c8-9ba7-47e5-acde-53063a69d483,Future Internet,154,13,N/A,2021,2021-06-13 00:00:00,39,48,"Andrei M.

As a result, an enormous amount of personal information and financial transactions become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Phishing is an example of a highly effective form of cybercrime that enables criminals to deceive users and steal important data. Since the first reported phishing attack in 1990, it has been evolved into a more sophisticated attack vector. At present, phishing is considered one of the most frequent examples of fraud activity on the Internet. Phishing attacks can lead to severe losses for their victims including sensitive information, identity theft, companies, and government secrets. This article aims to evaluate these attacks by identifying the current state of phishing and reviewing existing phishing techniques. Studies have classified phishing attacks according to fundamental phishing mechanisms and countermeasures discarding the importance of the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing. This article proposes a new detailed anatomy of phishing which involves attack phases, attacker’s types, vulnerabilities, threats, targets, attack mediums, and attacking techniques. Moreover, the proposed anatomy will help readers understand the process lifecycle of a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of these phishing attacks and the techniques being used; also, it helps in developing a holistic anti-phishing system.

The financial sector is the primary target of phishing, and there are many different approaches to combat phishing attacks. Software-based detection approaches are more prominent in phishing detection; however, still, there is no robust solution that can stable for a long period. The primary purpose of this paper is to propose a novel solution to detect phishing attacks using a combined model of LSTM and CNN deep networks with the use of both URLs and HTML pages. The URLs are learned using an LSTM network with 1D convolutional, and another 1D convolutional network is used to learn the HTML features. These two networks were trained separately and combined through a sigmoid layer by dropping the last layer of each model to have the proposed model. The proposed model reached 98.34% in terms of accuracy, and that is above the previously recorded highest accuracy of 97.3% among the detection models used both URL and HTML features in the explored literature. The solution requires feature extraction only with HTML pages, and URLs were directly fed with a minimum pre-processing. Although the proposed solution uses extracted HTML features, those do not depend on third-party services. Therefore, an efficient real-time application can be implemented using the proposed model to detect phishing attacks to safeguard Internet users.",International Journal of Advances in Applied Sciences,journal,,58f3d4ea-da1a-4755-85de-db89c331483c,International Journal of ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES,,,N/A,2020,2020-07-01 00:00:00,16,50,Ariyadasa et al.,2136758782,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0b3ed9172c5c011cd578b895fed056e28fa20da,Computer Science,2136758782

Phishing includes sending a user an email, or causing a phishing page to steal personal information from a user. Blacklist-based detection techniques can detect this form of attack; however, these approaches have certain limitations, and the number of people affecting have continued to grow. The aim of a technique for phishing detection using machine learning to identify each URL into either a legitimate URL or a phished URL. Data availability here in this proposed solution is the key to executing the solution and if there is any issue with data availability it can cost the project accuracy. Data used for model testing must be reliable and appropriate to almost identify all the websites that the user wants to check. Model consistency is another factor that may trigger project failure so the model has to be accurate in determining a true identity of URLs. This technique employs features of a standardized resource locator (URL). The features have been defined which contain URLs for the phishing site. The suggested approach employs certain characteristics to detect phishing. The strategy was tested with a data collection of 3,000 URLs for the phishing site and 3,000 valid URLs for the site. The findings show that more than 90 percent of phishing sites can be identified by the proposed technique",International journal of recent technology and engineering,journal,,8d848812-c4dd-4524-a6ac-5f5822355b19,International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering,,,N/A,2020,2020-05-30 00:00:00,1,27,"Associate Professor Neeraja Koppula, Vrinda Prabhakaram Ganti","2285981985, 2285688416",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5efe81c383a4601a654ac9724371d694a75e8278,"Computer Science, Engineering",2285981985

Based on observations from four monitoring wells, the persistence and periodicities of the loose porous aquifers, and the interrelation between precipitation and groundwater levels was examined based on a number of tools including autocorrelation, cross-correlation, spectral analysis, and wavelet transform. The results show that the groundwater levels at W1 and W2 present a downward trend while those at W3 and W4 show an upward trend. The dominant time period increases from 2.1 years (upstream) to 3.7 years (downstream). The time lags between aquifers and rainfall at W1, W2, W3 and W4 are 139.14 ± 59.76 days (2008–2020), 23.27 ± 12.03 days (2005–2014), 145.01 ± 68.00 days (2007–2020), and 59.22 ± 26.14 days (2005–2019), respectively. The lags for the pumping years are 1.2~2.1 times of those during the years without pumping. The recharge ratio overestimated by the water table fluctuation method decreases from 0.32 at W2 to 0.17 at W4, suggesting that the site W2 has a good potentiality for groundwater recharge.

It is an important factor in managing and sustaining the groundwater resources that are used for drinking water, irrigation, and other purposes. Groundwater level prediction is a critical aspect of water resource management and requires accurate and efficient modelling techniques. This study reviews the most commonly used conventional numerical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting GWL. Significant advancements have been made in terms of prediction efficiency over the last two decades. However, while researchers have primarily focused on predicting monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly GWL, water managers and strategists require multi-year GWL simulations to take effective steps towards ensuring the sustainable supply of groundwater. In this paper, we consider a collection of state-of-the-art theories to develop and design a novel methodology and improve modelling efficiency in this field of evaluation. We examined 109 research articles published from 2008 to 2022 that investigated different modelling techniques. Finally, we concluded that machine learning and deep learning approaches are efficient for modelling GWL. Moreover, we provide possible future research directions and recommendations to enhance the accuracy of GWL prediction models and improve relevant understanding.",Applied Sciences,journal,['Review'],136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-02-20 00:00:00,40,108,"Junaid Khan, Eunkyu Lee, A.

Identifying risk markers through easily accessible clinical data could help in the initial triage of COVID-19 patients and anticipate a fatal outcome, especially in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged regions. This study aims to identify markers that increase lethality risk in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, based on machine learning (ML) methods. Markers were differentiated by sex and age-group. Methods A total of 11,564 cases of COVID-19 in Mexico were extracted from the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease. Four ML classification methods were trained to predict lethality, and an interpretability approach was used to identify those markers. Results Models based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) yielded the best performance in a test set. This model achieved a sensitivity of 0.91, a specificity of 0.69, a positive predictive value of 0.344, and a negative predictive value of 0.965. For female patients, the leading markers are diabetes and arthralgia. For males, the main markers are chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chest pain. Dyspnea, hypertension, and polypnea increased the risk of death in both sexes. Conclusions ML-based models using an interpretability approach successfully identified risk markers for lethality by sex and age. Our results indicate that age is the strongest demographic factor for a fatal outcome, while all other markers were consistent with previous clinical trials conducted in a Mexican population. The markers identified here could be used as an initial triage, especially in geographic areas with limited resources.",BMC Infectious Diseases,journal,['JournalArticle'],1deb1192-6a27-4823-9578-6aa304bd3cdf,BMC Infectious Diseases,,23,N/A,2023,2023-01-11 00:00:00,7,69,"M.

The changes in water levels directly affect the circulation processes of lakes and rivers that control water mixing and bottom sediment resuspension, further affecting water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Thus, these considerations have made the water level monitoring process essential to save the environment. Machine learning hybrid models are emerging robust tools that are successfully applied for water level monitoring. Various models have been developed, and selecting the optimal model would be a lengthy procedure. A timely, detailed, and instructive overview of the models’ concepts and historical uses would be beneficial in preventing researchers from overlooking models’ potential selection and saving significant time on the problem. Thus, recent research on water level prediction using hybrid machines is reviewed in this article to present the “state of the art” on the subject and provide some suggestions on research methodologies and models. This comprehensive study classifies hybrid models into four types algorithm parameter optimisation-based hybrid models (OBH), pre-processing-based hybrid models (PBH), the components combination-based hybrid models (CBH), and hybridisation of parameter optimisation-based with preprocessing-based hybrid models (HOPH); furthermore, it explains the pre-processing of data in detail. Finally, the most popular optimisation methods and future perspectives and conclusions have been discussed.",Cogent Engineering,journal,['Review'],54313588-dd70-4bcb-b94a-84500673b4ec,Cogent Engineering,,9,N/A,2022,2022-11-11 00:00:00,21,127,"Sarah J.

In the region of the most abundant irrigated agriculture, water levels have declined up to 24 m and cones of depression have expanded greatly. Increases in area of irrigated land and groundwater withdrawals in the past 10 years are coeval with water-level declines near the USA-Mexico border. Known areas of groundwater recharge from streamflow infiltration, and springs discharging deep-sourced water, show evidence of net water-level rises in the past 40 years, but declines in the last 10 years, in concert with declining precipitation over the basin. Formerly irrigated lands exhibit water-level rises, suggestive of flattening of cones of depression after cessation of extensive groundwater pumping. Manual water-level measurements are vital for understanding and managing groundwater resources, yet they are expensive and laborious to collect, which has resulted in much fewer data in recent years. Spatiotemporal kriging is more complex in mathematical development and implementation than spatial kriging, but it yields improved precision and accuracy, predictions at times with no data as well as at locations with no data, and fewer artifacts due to changing well networks. Its ability to leverage historical data recommends its use in hydrologic studies dependent on water-level maps and changes in water levels over time.",Hydrogeology Journal,journal,,5bf57a66-684a-44ab-9f79-0269b2965318,Hydrogeology Journal,2479 - 2494,30,N/A,2022,2022-10-10 00:00:00,5,65,G.

We benchmark the currently proposed setup in an analysis of dimension-6 effective field theory operators for W H production. Calculating the Fisher information allows us to quantify the sensitivity of this framework to new physics and study its dependence on phase space. New machine- learning techniques let us compare the simplified template cross section framework to the full, high-dimensional kinematic information. We show that the way in which we truncate the effective theory has a sizable impact on the definition of the optimal simplified template cross sections.",Journal of High Energy Physics,journal,,cb5c6d2c-8c82-406e-b42e-b691561f3e4e,Journal of High Energy Physics,,2019,N/A,2019,2019-08-19 00:00:00,37,79,"J.

 bosons via Higgs-strahlung","We propose differential observables for $pp \to Z(\ell^+\ell^-)h(bb)$ that can be used to completely determine the tensor structure of the $hZZ^*/hZ\bar{f}f$ couplings relevant to this process in the dimension-6 SMEFT. In particular, we propose a strategy to probe the anomalous $h Z_{\mu \nu}Z^{\mu \nu}$ and $h Z_{\mu \nu}\tilde{Z}^{\mu \nu}$ vertices at the percent level. We show that this can achieved by resurrecting the interference term between the transverse $Zh$ amplitude, which receives contributions from the above couplings, and the dominant SM longitudinal amplitude. These contributions are hard to isolate without a knowledge of the analytical amplitude, as they vanish unless the process is studied differentially in three different angular variables at the level of the $Z$-decay products. By also including the differential distributions with respect to energy variables, we obtain projected bounds for the two other tensor structures of the Higgs coupling to $Z$-bosons.",Physical Review D,Unknown,,Unknown,Physical Review D,,,Unknown,2019,2019-05-07 00:00:00,26,86,"S.

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) have been proven to enhance quality of care by promoting change in prescription practices through antimicrobial selection advice. However, bypassing an initial assessment to determine the existence of an underlying disease that justifies the need of antimicrobial therapy might lead to indiscriminate and often unnecessary prescriptions.MethodsFrom pathology laboratory tests, six biochemical markers were selected and combined with microbiology outcomes from susceptibility tests to create a unique dataset with over one and a half million daily profiles to perform infection risk inference. Outliers were discarded using the inter-quartile range rule and several sampling techniques were studied to tackle the class imbalance problem. The first phase selects the most effective and robust model during training using ten-fold stratified cross-validation. The second phase evaluates the final model after isotonic calibration in scenarios with missing inputs and imbalanced class distributions.ResultsMore than 50% of infected profiles have daily requested laboratory tests for the six biochemical markers with very promising infection inference results: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.80-0.83), sensitivity (0.64-0.75) and specificity (0.92-0.97). Standardization consistently outperforms normalization and sensitivity is enhanced by using the SMOTE sampling technique. Furthermore, models operated without noticeable loss in performance if at least four biomarkers were available.ConclusionThe selected biomarkers comprise enough information to perform infection risk inference with a high degree of confidence even in the presence of incomplete and imbalanced data. Since they are commonly available in hospitals, Clinical Decision Support Systems could benefit from these findings to assist clinicians in deciding whether or not to initiate antimicrobial therapy to improve prescription practices.",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,journal,['JournalArticle'],76da9cc5-c5a7-42b4-a250-3e708c5f4980,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,17,N/A,2017,2017-12-08 00:00:00,38,44,"Bernard Hernandez, P.

However, due to the nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision‐making by such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black‐box process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on peer‐reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets. Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top model‐agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage, explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model primarily explained tree‐based ensemble machine learning models. The most common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as tree‐based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability, fairness, and trustworthiness of AI‐enabled health systems and medical devices and, ultimately, the quality of care and outcomes.",Cancer Innovation,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",2b26564e-138e-414c-bfb6-3c706a1f532b,Cancer Innovation,,3,N/A,2024,2024-07-03 00:00:00,8,146,"Amirehsan Ghasemi, Soheil Hashtarkhani, David L.

Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations, including underdiagnosis, false positive cases, and overdiagnosis. Indeed, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities, including digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, breast MRI, and, more recently, contrast-enhanced mammography, are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a “one-size-fits-all” approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening. Key Points Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available. Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening. Key recommendations Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach, regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35–40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available, ultrasound can be performed as an alternative, although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited. Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians.",European Radiology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",47f41409-58e8-4cf2-b8cb-2470d27e901a,European Radiology,6348 - 6357,34,N/A,2024,2024-04-24 00:00:00,9,56,"Magda Marcon, Michael H Fuchsjäger, P.

Recent technological advances in breast cancer treatment offer hope to millions of women in the world. Segmentation of the breast’s Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is one of the necessary tasks in the diagnosis and detection of breast cancer. Currently, a popular deep learning model, U-Net is extensively used in biomedical image segmentation. This article aims to advance the state of the art and conduct a more in-depth analysis with a focus on the use of various U-Net models in lesion detection in women’s breast DCE-MRI. In this article, we perform an empirical study of the effectiveness and efficiency of U-Net and its derived deep learning models including ResUNet, Dense UNet, DUNet, Attention U-Net, UNet++, MultiResUNet, RAUNet, Inception U-Net and U-Net GAN for lesion detection in breast DCE-MRI. All the models are applied to the benchmarked 100 Sagittal T2-Weighted fat-suppressed DCE-MRI slices of 20 patients and their performance is compared. Also, a comparative study has been conducted with V-Net, W-Net, and DeepLabV3+. Non-parametric statistical test Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is used to analyze the significance of the quantitative results. Furthermore, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is used to evaluate overall performance focused on accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F $$_1$$ 1 -score, specificity, Geometric-Mean, DSC, and false-positive rate. The RAUNet segmentation model achieved a high accuracy of 99.76%, sensitivity of 85.04%, precision of 90.21%, and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.04% whereas ResNet achieved 99.62% accuracy, 62.26% sensitivity, 99.56% precision, and 72.86% DSC. ResUNet is found to be the most effective model based on MCDA. On the other hand, U-Net GAN takes the least computational time to perform the segmentation task. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the ResNet model performs better than other models in segmenting the images and lesion detection, though computational time in achieving the objectives varies.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,N/A,2023,2023-12-18 00:00:00,4,64,"Sudarshan Saikia, Tapas Si, Darpan Deb, K.

First, the classification and regression tree featuring Gini index is applied to explore the classification criteria of high potassium glass and lead barium glass, and the accuracy of the model is tested by 10-fold cross-validation. Secondly, subclasses were classified for the collected sample data. In this paper, Two Step Cluster Algorithm is used to divide the high potassium glass into four subclasses and the lead barium glass into five subclasses based on the Euclidean distance between the samples.

As a result, they are the principal narrators of the former climate, life, and important events on the surface of the Earth. The complexity and cost of direct destructive laboratory tests adversely affect the data scarcity problem, making the development of intelligent indirect methods an integral step in attempts to address the problem faced by rock engineering projects. This study established an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to predict the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) in MPa of sedimentary rocks using different input parameters; i.e., dry density (ρd) in g/cm3, Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) in MPa, and wet density (ρwet) in g/cm3. The developed ANN models, M1, M2, and M3, were divided as follows: the overall dataset, 70% training dataset and 30% testing dataset, and 60% training dataset and 40% testing dataset, respectively. In addition, multiple linear regression (MLR) was performed for comparison to the proposed ANN models to verify the accuracy of the predicted values. The performance indices were also calculated by estimating the established models. The predictive performance of the M2 ANN model in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), variance accounts for (VAF), and a20-index was 0.831, 0.27672, 0.92, and 0.80, respectively, in the testing dataset, revealing ideal results, thus it was proposed as the best-fit prediction model for UCS of sedimentary rocks at the Thar coalfield, Pakistan, among the models developed in this study. Moreover, by performing a sensitivity analysis, it was determined that BTS was the most influential parameter in predicting UCS.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-03-29 00:00:00,17,57,"Xin Wei, Niaz Muhammad Shahani, Xigui Zheng","2110849533, 101581818, 3630260",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34e6ee72e294c915f7218656fc779ec238bab019,"Engineering, Geology",2110849533

Ancient glass in China mostly consisted of lead glass, and potassium glass is widely believed to be imported abroad. In order to figure out the origin of glass artefacts, it is crucial to define the type of glass products accurately. In contemporary research on the chemical composition of ancient glass products, potassium glass is separated from lead glass primarily by the weight ratio of oxides or the proportion of lead-containing compounds. This approach can be excessively subjective and prone to mistakes while calculating the mass fraction of compounds containing potassium. So, it is better to find out the link between the proportion of glass’s chemical composition and its classifications during the weathering process of the glass products, to develop an effective classification model using machine learning techniques. In this research, we suggest employing the slime mould approach to optimise the parameters of a support vector machine and examine a 69-group glass chemical composition dataset. In addition, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared to those of commonly used classification models: decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and support vector machines optimised by genetic algorithms (GA-SVM). The results of this research indicated that the support vector machine method with the sticky slime mould algorithm strategy is the most effective. On the training set, 100% accuracy was attained, while on the test set, 97.50% accuracy was attained in this research. The research results demonstrate that the support vector machine algorithm combining the slime mould algorithm strategy is capable of providing a trustworthy classification reference for future glass artefacts.",Applied Sciences,journal,,136edf8d-0f88-4c2c-830f-461c6a9b842e,Applied Sciences,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-14 00:00:00,15,45,"Yuheng Guo, Wei Zhan, Weihao Li","46791232, 144267505, 2108712523",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3291d5f8212a1e38afeb5efba6af06244befccba,Materials Science,46791232

This paper proposes an ARIMA-LSTM combined forecasting model based on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. In the ARIMA-LSTM model, the ARIMA model is used to process the historical data of gas time series and obtain the corresponding linear prediction results and residual series. The LSTM model is used in further analysis of the residual series, predicting the nonlinear factors in the residual series. The prediction results of the combined model are compared separately with those of the two single models. Finally, RMSE, MAPE and R2 are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the three models. The results of the study show that the metrics of the combined ARIMA-LSTM model are R2 = 0.9825, MAPE = 0.0124 and RMSE = 0.083. The combined model has the highest prediction accuracy and the lowest error and is more suitable for the predictive analysis of gas data. By comparing the prediction results of a single model and the combined model on gas time series data, the applicability, validity and scientificity of the combined model proposed in this paper are verified, which is of great importance to accurate prediction and early warning of underground gas danger in coal mines.",Processes,,,939ba3df-4270-4ba0-ad98-ffe889f3546e,Processes,,,Unknown,2023,2023-01-05 00:00:00,10,30,"Chuan Li, X.

The intracellular heat generation and its measurement can also assist in the prediction of the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. However, intracellular thermometry without altering the biochemical reactions and cellular membrane damage is challenging, requiring appropriately biocompatible, nontoxic, and efficient biosensors. Bright, photostable, and functionalized fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) have emerged as excellent probes for intracellular thermometry and magnetometry with the spatial resolution on a nanometer scale. The temperature and magnetic field-dependent luminescence of naturally occurring defects in diamonds are key to high-sensitivity biosensing applications. Alterations in the surface chemistry of FNDs and conjugation with polymer, metallic, and magnetic nanoparticles have opened vast possibilities for drug delivery, diagnosis, nanomedicine, and magnetic hyperthermia. This study covers some recently reported research focusing on intracellular thermometry, magnetic sensing, and emerging applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedical imaging. We extend the application of FNDs as biosensors toward disease diagnosis by using intracellular, stationary, and time-dependent information.

However, there are some circumstances where it is impossible to prepare the necessary specimens after exposure to high temperatures. Therefore, the propensity to estimate the destructive parameters of thermally heated rocks based on non-destructive factors is a helpful research field. Egyptian granodiorite samples were heated to temperatures of up to 800 °C before being treated to two different cooling methods: via the oven (slow-cooling) and using water (rapid cooling). The cooling condition, temperature, mass, porosity, absorption, dry density (D), and P-waves were used as input parameters in the predictive models for the UCS and E of thermally treated Egyptian granodiorite. Multi-linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to create predictive models. The performance of each prediction model was also evaluated using the (R2), (RMSE), (MAPE), and (VAF). The findings revealed that cooling methods and mass as input parameters to predict UCS and E have a minor impact on prediction models. In contrast, the other parameters had a good relationship with UCS and E. Due to severe damage to granodiorite samples, many input and output parameters were impossible to measure after 600 °C. The prediction models were thus developed up to this threshold temperature. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of predictive models demonstrated that the ANN pattern for predicting the UCS and E is the most accurate model, with R2 of 0.99, MAPE of 0.25%, VAF of 97.22%, and RMSE of 2.04.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2022,2022-11-30 00:00:00,7,80,"M.

First, the method improves the ecological footprint model based on energy analysis and constructs a comprehensive regional ecological data model; considering the complex characteristics of ecological data set, based on the ARIMA network model and LSTM model, a reliable and efficient big data prediction model of per capita ecological carrying capacity is established by analyzing the linear or nonlinear data sets in the data set.

Cloud computing provides different services over the internet, thus eliminating the need for personalized hardware and other resources. Cloud computing environments face some challenges in terms of resource utilization, energy efficiency, heterogeneous resources, etc. Tasks scheduling and virtual machines (VMs) are used as consolidation techniques in order to tackle these issues. Tasks scheduling has been extensively studied in the literature. The problem has been studied with different parameters and objectives. In this article, we address the problem of energy consumption and efficient resource utilization in virtualized cloud data centers. The proposed algorithm is based on task classification and thresholds for efficient scheduling and better resource utilization. In the first phase, workflow tasks are pre-processed to avoid bottlenecks by placing tasks with more dependencies and long execution times in separate queues. In the next step, tasks are classified based on the intensities of the required resources. Finally, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to select the best schedules. Experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Comparative results obtained on benchmark datasets are presented.

In the context of cloud auto-scaling, an important issue is the ability to define and use a resource reservation plan, which enables efficient resource scheduling. If necessary, the plan may allocate new resources upon reservation where a sufficient amount of resources is available. Our solution allows the updating of a reservation plan initially prepared by an administrator. It makes it possible to adapt reservation plans one or more weeks ahead. Hence, it allows time for the administrator to analyze the plan and discover potential problems with resource under-provisioning or over-provisioning, which may prevent server overload in the former case and unnecessary expenses in the latter. It also makes it possible to extract and analyze the knowledge learned, which may provide useful information about resource usage characteristics.

This is essential for reducing power consumption and guaranteeing QoS and SLA fulfillment, especially for those services with strict QoS requirements in terms of latency or response time, such as web servers with high traffic load, data stream processing, or real-time big data analytics. Elasticity is often implemented in cloud platforms and virtualized data-centers by means of auto-scaling mechanisms. These make automated resource provisioning decisions based on the value of specific infrastructure and/or service performance metrics. This paper presents and evaluates a novel predictive auto-scaling mechanism based on machine learning techniques for time series forecasting and queuing theory. The new mechanism aims to accurately predict the processing load of a distributed server and estimate the appropriate number of resources that must be provisioned in order to optimize the service response time and fulfill the SLA contracted by the user, while attenuating resource over-provisioning in order to reduce energy consumption and infrastructure costs.

899db02ba28ef2479b5bea3e51627685be5b3865,10.3390/s17112556,Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Human Activity Recognition,"Adopting deep learning methods for human activity recognition has been effective in extracting discriminative features from raw input sequences acquired from body-worn sensors. Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time, typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However, the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result, typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity-recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper, we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences.

Smart homes embedded with smart devices and sensors enabled many context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. This study presents XAI-HAR, a novel XAI-empowered human activity recognition (HAR) approach based on key features identified from the data collected from sensors located at different places in a smart home. XAI-HAR identifies a set of new features (i.e., the total number of sensors used in a specific activity), as physical key features selection (PKFS) based on weighting criteria. Next, it presents statistical key features selection (SKFS) (i.e., mean, standard deviation) to handle the outliers and higher class variance. The proposed XAI-HAR is evaluated using machine learning models, namely, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and deep learning models such as deep neural network (DNN), convolution neural network (CNN), and CNN-based long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of XAI-HAR using RF classifier over all other machine learning and deep learning models. For explainability, XAI-HAR uses Local Interpretable Model Agnostic (LIME) with an RF classifier. XAI-HAR achieves 0.96% of F-score for health and dementia classification and 0.95 and 0.97% for activity recognition of dementia and healthy individuals, respectively.",Frontiers in Public Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],d3dd5449-daa1-4d57-9412-9add6037584f,Frontiers in Public Health,,11,N/A,2023,2023-03-09 00:00:00,15,72,"A.

A real-time hand gesture recognition system should aim to develop a user-independent interface with high recognition performance. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show high recognition rates in image classification problems. Due to the unavailability of large labeled image samples in static hand gesture images, it is a challenging task to train deep CNN networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet from scratch. Therefore, inspired by CNN performance, an end-to-end fine-tuning method of a pre-trained CNN model with score-level fusion technique is proposed here to recognize hand gestures in a dataset with a low number of gesture images. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOO CV) and regular CV tests on two benchmark datasets. A real-time American sign language (ASL) recognition system is developed and tested using the proposed technique.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,22,20223dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2022,2022-01-18 00:00:00,88,40,"J.

Previous research shows that dog–owner relationship has multifarious effects on dog behavior. However, little is known about the interplay between dog–owner relationship, physical activity of the dog, and affective experiences at the time of the owner leaving home and reunion when the owner comes home. In this paper, we explored how the general (daily, home alone, and over the 2-week study period) physical activity of the dog, and owner's perceptions of the dog's affective state were correlated at those particular moments. Nineteen volunteer dog owners had their dogs (N = 19) wear two activity trackers (ActiGraph wGT2X-GT and FitBark2) for 2 weeks 24 h/day. Prior to the 2-week continuous physical activity measurement period, the owners filled in questionnaires about the dog–owner relationship and the dog behavior. In daily questionnaires, owners described and assessed their own and their perception of the emotion-related experiences of their dog and behavior of the dog at the moment of separation and reunion. The results indicated that the dog–owner relationship has an interplay with the mean daily and weekly physical activity levels of the dog. An indication of strong emotional dog–owner relationship (especially related to the attentiveness of the dog, continuous companionship, and time spent together when relaxing) correlated positively with the mean daily activity levels of the dog during the first measurement week of the study. Results also suggest that the mean daily and over the 2-week measurement period physical activity of the dog correlated the affective experiences of the dog and owner as reported by the owner when the dog was left home alone. More research is needed to understand the interplay between affect, physical activity of the dog, dog–owner relationship, and the effects of these factors on, and their interplay with, the welfare of dogs.",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],d5e0c47e-1f80-41d8-a565-44d86b990db3,Frontiers in Veterinary Science,,8,N/A,2021,2021-12-09 00:00:00,7,36,"H.

Sitting with computers for a long time may lead to unhealthy conditions like shoulder pain, numbness, headache, etc. To overcome this problem, human posture should be changed for particular intervals of time. This paper deals with using an inertial sensor built in the smartphone and can be used to overcome the unhealthy human sitting behaviors (HSBs) of the office worker. To monitor, six volunteers are considered within the age band of 26 ± 3 years, out of which four were male and two were female. Here, the inertial sensor is attached to the rear upper trunk of the body, and a dataset is generated for five different activities performed by the subjects while sitting in the chair in the office. Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) technique and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are jointly used to select feature vectors. The optimized features are fed to machine learning supervised classifiers such as naive Bayes, SVM, and KNN for recognition. Finally, the SVM classifier achieved 99.90% overall accuracy for different human sitting behaviors using an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,['JournalArticle'],3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-10-01 00:00:00,26,50,"V.

With recent advances in machine learning and embedded computing, much more nuanced and accurate behavior classification has become possible, giving these affordable consumer devices the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pet healthcare. Here we describe a novel deep learning algorithm that classifies dog behavior at sub-second resolution using commercial pet activity monitors. We built machine learning training databases from over 5,000 videos of over 2,500 dogs and ran the algorithms in production on over 11 million days of device data. We then surveyed project participants representing 10,550 dogs, they provided us 163,110 event responses to validate real-world detection of eating and drinking behavior. The resultant algorithm displayed a sensitivity and specificity for detecting drinking behavior (0.949 and 0.999, respectively) and eating behavior (0.988, 0.983). We also demonstrated detection of licking, petting, rubbing, scratching, and sniffing. We show that the devices’ position on the collar has no measurable impact on performance. In production, users reported a true positive rate of 95.3% for eating (among 1,514 users), and of 94.9% (among 1,491 users) for drinking. The study demonstrates the accurate detection of important health-related canine behaviors using a collar-mounted accelerometer. We trained and validated our algorithms on a large and realistic training dataset, and we assessed and confirmed accuracy in production via user validation.",bioRxiv,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,,11,N/A,2020,2020-12-14 00:00:00,47,55,"Robert D.

Previous studies indicated that owning a companion animal, such as a dog or a cat, has benefits for good mental health. Interactions with animals may help with depression and anxiety, particularly under stress-prone conditions. Human–animal interactions may even improve peer-to-peer social relationships, as well as enhance feelings of respect, trust, and empathy between people. Interestingly, it has also been shown that stress and poor well-being of dog owners negatively affect the well-being of their companion animals. However, a dramatic increase in dog abandonment could potentially occur due to COVID-19 related health, economic and social stresses, as well as due to the inconclusive reports of companion animals being potential COVID-19 carriers. Such a scenario may lead to high costs and considerable public health risks. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related social isolation, might lead to dramatic changes in human–dog bidirectional relationships. Using unique prospective and retrospective datasets, our objectives were to investigate how people perceived and acted during the COVID-19 pandemic social isolation, in regards to dog adoption and abandonment; and to examine the bidirectional relationship between the well-being of dog owners and that of their dogs. Overall, according to our analysis, as the social isolation became more stringent during the pandemic, the interest in dog adoption and the adoption rate increased significantly, while abandonment did not change. Moreover, there was a clear association between an individual’s impaired quality of life and their perceptions of a parallel deterioration in the quality of life of their dogs and reports of new behavioral problems. As humans and dogs are both social animals, these findings suggest potential benefits of the human–dog relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with the One Welfare approach that implies that there is a bidirectional connection between the welfare and health of humans and non-human animals. As our climate continues to change, more disasters including pandemics will likely occur, highlighting the importance of research into crisis-driven changes in human–animal relationships.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,1-11,7,Unknown,2020,2020-11-24 00:00:00,123,51,"L.

Backscatter radio—in which wireless communication is achieved via reflection rather than radiation—is a low-complexity approach that requires a minimal number of active elements. However, it is typically limited to data rates of hundreds of megabits per second because of the low frequency bands used and the modulation techniques involved. Here we report a millimetre-wave modulator and antenna array for backscatter communications at gigabit data rates. This radiofrequency front-end consists of a microstrip patch antenna array and a single pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility transistor that supports a range of modulation formats including binary phase shift keying, quadrature phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation. The circuit is additively manufactured with inkjet printing using silver nanoparticle inks on a flexible liquid-crystal polymer substrate. A millimetre-wave transceiver is also designed to capture and downconvert the backscattered signals and route them for digital signal processing. With the system, we demonstrate a bit rate of two gigabits per second of backscatter transmission at millimetre-wave frequencies of 24–28 GHz, and with a front-end energy consumption of 0.17 pJ per bit. A microstrip patch antenna array and a single high-electron-mobility transistor, which are created with inkjet printing, can be used for backscatter communication at millimetre-wave frequencies, providing a bit rate of two gigabits per second and with a front-end energy consumption of only 0.17 pJ per bit.",Nature Electronics,,,72753051-64d8-439b-a76f-c70555ac654d,Nature Electronics,439 - 446,4,Unknown,2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,61,44,"J.

The process of evaluating a value for the GMFM index can be time consuming. It typically takes 45 to 60 min for the patient to complete all tasks, sometimes in two or more sessions. The diagnostic procedure requires trained and specialized therapists. The paper presents the estimation of the GMFM measure for patients with cerebral palsy based on the results of the Zebris FDM-T treadmill. For this purpose, the regression analysis was used. Estimations based on the Generalized Linear Regression were assessed using different error metrics. The results obtained showed that the GMFM score can be estimated with acceptable accuracy. Because the Zebris FDM-T is a widely used device in gait rehabilitation, our method has the potential to be widely adopted for objective diagnostics of children with cerebral palsy.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,journal,['JournalArticle'],7fe84005-586f-4604-98ee-fa60fe8ae618,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,11,N/A,2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,5,71,"Mariusz Bedla, Paweł Pięta, Daniel Kaczmarski, S.

Gait assessment is one of the essential steps of gait management. It has been widely used for clinical decision making and evaluation of different treatment outcomes. However, most of the present methods of gait assessment are subjective, less sensitive to small pathological changes, time-taking and need a great effort of an expert. This work proposes an automated, comprehensive gait assessment score (A-GAS) for gait disorders in CP. Kinematic data of 356 CP and 41 typically developing subjects is used to validate the performance of A-GAS. For the computation of A-GAS, instance abnormality index (AII) and abnormality index (AI) are calculated. AII quantifies gait abnormality of a gait cycle instance, while AI quantifies gait abnormality of a joint angle profile during walking. AII is calculated for all gait cycle instances by performing probabilistic and statistical analyses. Abnormality index (AI) is a weighted sum of AII, computed for each joint angle profile. A-GAS is a weighted sum of AI, calculated for a lower limb. Moreover, a graphical representation of the gait assessment report, including AII, AI, and A-GAS is generated for providing a better depiction of the assessment score. Furthermore, the work compares A-GAS with a present rating-based gait assessment scores to understand fundamental differences. Finally, A-GAS’s performance is verified for a high-cost multi-camera set-up using nine joint angle profiles and a low-cost single camera set-up using three joint angle profiles. Results show no significant differences in performance of A-GAS for both the set-ups. Therefore, A-GAS for both the set-ups can be used interchangeably.",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering,journal,['JournalArticle'],416b088d-de72-4dbf-959e-8551984d9676,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,2530-2539,29,N/A,2021,2021-10-05 00:00:00,9,48,"Rishabh Bajpai, D.

A large number of them are installed using trenchless Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) technology. The aim of this work was to develop and compare new machine learning models dedicated for risk assessment in HDD projects. The data from 133 HDD projects from eight countries of the world were gathered, profiled, and preprocessed. Three machine learning models, logistic regression, random forests, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were developed to predict the overall HDD project outcome (failure free installation or installation likely to fail), and the occurrence of identified unwanted events. The best performance in terms of recall and accuracy was achieved for the developed ANN model, which proved to be efficient, fast and robust in predicting risks in HDD projects. Machine learning applications in the proposed models enabled eliminating the involvement of a group of experts in the risk assessment process and therefore significantly lower the costs associated with the risk assessment process.

Clinical gait analysis (CGA) is used to identify, understand and support the management of gait deviations in CP. Children with CP often use ankle–foot orthosis (AFO) to facilitate and optimize their walking ability. The aim of this study was to assess whether the gait deviation index (GDI) and the gait variability index (GVI) results can reflect the changes of spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters in spastic hemiplegic CP children wearing AFO. Method: The study group consisted of 37 CP children with hemiparesis. All had undergone a comprehensive, instrumented gait analysis while walking, both barefoot and with their AFO, during the same CGA session. Kinematic and spatio-temporal data were collected and GVI and GDI gait indexes were calculated. Results: Significant differences were found between the barefoot condition and the AFO conditions for selected spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters. Changes in GVI and GDI were also statistically significant. Conclusions: The use of AFO in hemiplegic CP children caused a statistically significant improvement in spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters. It was found that these changes were also reflected by GVI and GDI. These findings might suggest that gait indices, such as GDI and GVI, as clinical outcome measures, may reflect the effects of specific therapeutic interventions in CP children.",Children,journal,['JournalArticle'],083c6c99-5d39-4452-88c4-2963e15f8a0f,Children,,7,N/A,2020,2020-09-25 00:00:00,8,27,"Majewska Joanna, Szczepanik Magdalena, Bazarnik-Mucha Katarzyna, Szymczyk Daniel, Lenart-Domka Ewa","1990712483, 1990710561, 1990708574, 1990625860, 1990718242",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a221d095c04ab0dcf238693d51c766f8bb91ef8b,"Engineering, Medicine",1990712483

However, if these deficits are associated with axial rigidity, the functional mobility or health related quality of life (HRQoL), remains unknown. The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between axial ROM and axial rigidity, the functional mobility and HRQoL in patients with mild to moderate PD. Methods: An exploratory study was conducted. Non-probabilistic sampling of consecutive cases was used. Active trunk ROM was assessed by a universal goniometer. A Biodex System isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure the rigidity of the trunk. Functional mobility was determined by the Get Up and Go (GUG) test, and HRQoL was assessed with the PDQ-39 and EuroQol-5D questionnaires. Results: Thirty-six mild to moderate patients with PD were evaluated. Significant correlations were observed between trunk extensors rigidity and trunk flexion and extension ROM. Significant correlations were observed between trunk flexion, extension and rotation ROM and GUG. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between trunk ROM for flexion, extension and rotations (both sides) and PDQ-39 total score. However, these correlations were considered poor. Conclusions: Trunk ROM for flexion and extension movements, measured by a universal goniometer, were correlated with axial extensors rigidity, evaluated by a technological device at 30°/s and 45°/s, and functional mobility.

Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries.",Nucleic Acids Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],da96c220-cd39-4894-bae6-d2d77c8e7aa9,Nucleic Acids Research,e71 - e71,44,N/A,2015,2015-12-23 00:00:00,2775,38,"A.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixty-eight individuals (mean age 13.3 ± 5.7 years; 35% female, 92% Caucasian) were randomized to HCLC followed by SAP therapy (intensive group; N = 48) or to the usual-care group treated with multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy (N = 20). Primary outcome was C-peptide concentrations during mixed-meal tolerance tests at 12 months. RESULTS Intensive-group participants initiated HCLC a median of 6 days after diagnosis for a median duration of 71.3 h, during which median participant mean glucose concentration was 140 mg/dL (interquartile range 134–153 mg/dL). During outpatient SAP, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use decreased over time, and at 12 months, only 33% of intensive participants averaged sensor use ≥6 days/week. In the usual-care group, insulin pump and CGM use were initiated prior to 12 months by 15 and 5 participants, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were similar in both groups throughout the study. At 12 months, the geometric mean (95% CI) of C-peptide area under the curve was 0.43 (0.34–0.52) pmol/mL in the intensive group and 0.52 (0.32–0.75) pmol/mL in the usual-care group (P = 0.49). Thirty-seven (79%) intensive and 16 (80%) usual-care participants had a peak C-peptide concentration ≥0.2 pmol/mL (P = 0.30).

We investigate the distribution of expression data in human cancer genomes and study the implications of deviations from the normal distribution for translational molecular oncology research. Methods We conducted a central moments analysis of five cancer genomes and performed empiric distribution fitting to examine the true distribution of expression data both on the complete-experiment and on the individual-gene levels. We used a variety of parametric and nonparametric methods to test the effects of deviations from normality on gene calling, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification using a sixth cancer genome. Results Central moments analyses reveal statistically-significant deviations from normality in all of the analyzed cancer genomes. We observe as much as 37% variability in gene calling, 39% variability in functional annotation, and 30% variability in prospective, molecular tumor subclassification associated with this effect. Conclusions Cancer gene expression profiles are not normally-distributed, either on the complete-experiment or on the individual-gene level. Instead, they exhibit complex, heavy-tailed distributions characterized by statistically-significant skewness and kurtosis. The non-Gaussian distribution of this data affects identification of differentially-expressed genes, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification. These effects may be reduced in some circumstances, although not completely eliminated, by using nonparametric analytics. This analysis highlights two unreliable assumptions of translational cancer gene expression analysis: that “small” departures from normality in the expression data distributions are analytically-insignificant and that “robust” gene-calling algorithms can fully compensate for these effects.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,7,N/A,2012,2012-10-31 00:00:00,31,51,"Nicholas F.

However, effectively training deep learning models typically necessitates substantial quantities of high-quality data, a resource often lacking in numerous medical imaging scenarios. One way to overcome this deficiency is to artificially generate such images. Therefore, in this comparative study we train five generative models to artificially increase the amount of available data in such a scenario. This synthetic data approach is evaluated on a a downstream classification task, predicting four causes for pneumonia as well as healthy cases on 1082 chest X-ray images. Quantitative and medical assessments show that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach significantly outperforms more recent diffusion-based approaches on this limited dataset with better image quality and pathological plausibility. We show that better image quality surprisingly does not translate to improved classification performance by evaluating five different classification models and varying the amount of additional training data. Class-specific metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score show a substantial improvement by using synthetic images, emphasizing the data rebalancing effect of less frequent classes. However, overall performance does not improve for most models and configurations, except for a DreamBooth approach which shows a +0.52 improvement in overall accuracy. The large variance of performance impact in this study suggests a careful consideration of utilizing generative models for limited data scenarios, especially with an unexpected negative correlation between image quality and downstream classification improvement.",Bioengineering,journal,['JournalArticle'],103075b0-1b66-4b69-9c47-f54875634fba,Bioengineering,,10,N/A,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,4,68,"Daniel Schaudt, Christian Späte, Reinhold von Schwerin, Manfred Reichert, Marianne von Schwerin, Meinrad Beer, Christopher Kloth","2145260466, 2219655363, 2189632504, 2261720594, 2261719676, 2239385882, 2207671405",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db5ccb1d7e75c23995a42806e8ea2e03b074269d,"Computer Science, Medicine",2145260466

The aim is to develop an automatic image processing approach based on two artificial intelligence ( AI ) techniques in intraoral (periapical and bitewing) radiographs to assist dentists in determining bone loss. The first is a deep learning ( DL ) object-detector (YOLOv3) to roughly identify (no exact localization is required) two objects: prosthesis (crown) and implant (screw). The second is an image understanding-based ( IU ) process to fine-tune lines on screw edges and to identify significant points (intensity bone changes, intersections between screw and crown). Distances between these points are used to compute bone loss. A total of 2920 radiographs were used for training (50%) and testing (50%) the DL process. The mAP@0.5 metric is used for performance evaluation of DL considering periapical/bitewing and screws/crowns in upper and lower jaws, with scores ranging from 0.537 to 0.898 (sufficient because DL only needs an approximation). The IU performance is assessed with 50% of the testing radiographs through the t test statistical method, obtaining p values of 0.0106 (line fitting) and 0.0213 (significant point detection). The IU performance is satisfactory, as these values are in accordance with the statistical average/standard deviation in pixels for line fitting (2.75/1.01) and for significant point detection (2.63/1.28) according to the expert criteria of dentists, who establish the ground-truth lines and significant points. In conclusion, AI methods have good prospects for automatic bone loss detection in intraoral radiographs to assist dental specialists in diagnosing peri-implantitis.",Journal of digital imaging,journal,['JournalArticle'],d97d3d34-0bc5-4a81-9542-b39361ecf3aa,Journal of Digital Imaging,2259 - 2277,36,N/A,2023,2023-07-19 00:00:00,7,53,"M.

To support our solution, we introduce a multiparty version of the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic cryptosystem and implement it in an open-source library. MHE-based MPC solutions have several advantages: Their transcript is public, their o~ine phase is compact, and their circuit-evaluation procedure is noninteractive. By exploiting these properties, the communication complexity of MPC tasks is reduced from quadratic to linear in the number of parties, thus enabling secure computation among potentially thousands of parties and in a broad variety of computing paradigms, from the traditional peer-to-peer setting to cloud-outsourcing and smart-contract technologies. MHE-based approaches can also outperform the state-of-the-art solutions, even for a small number of parties. We demonstrate this for three circuits: private input selection with application to private-information retrieval, component-wise vector multiplication with application to private-set intersection, and Beaver multiplication triples generation. For the first circuit, privately selecting one input among eight thousand parties’ (of 32 KB each) requires only 1.31 MB of communication per party and completes in 61.7 seconds. For the second circuit with eight parties, our approach is 8.6 times faster and requires 39.3 times less communication than the current methods. For the third circuit and ten parties, our approach generates 20 times more triples per second while requiring 136 times less communication per-triple than an approach based on oblivious transfer. We implemented our scheme in the Lattigo library and open-sourced the code at github.com/ldsec/lattigo.",Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,,['JournalArticle'],d5dc4224-e4c3-43c9-918a-bd6326650b5b,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,291 - 311,2021,Unknown,2021,2021-07-23 00:00:00,107,59,"C.

Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables a group to jointly perform a computation without disclosing any participant’s private inputs. The participants agree on a function to compute, and then can use an MPC protocol to jointly compute the output of that function on their secret inputs without revealing them. This monograph provides an introduction to multi-party computation for practitioners interested in building privacy-preserving applications and researchers who want to work in the area. The authors introduce the foundations of MPC and describe the current state of the art. The goal is to enable readers to understand what is possible today, and what may be possible in the future. It provides a starting point for building applications using MPC and for developing MPC protocols, implementations, tools, and applications.

They are therefore involved in the development of persistent pain. One of the main sites of interaction of the immune system with persistent pain has been identified as neuro-immune crosstalk at the glial-opioid interface. The present study examined a potential association between the DNA methylation of two key players of glial/opioid intersection and persistent postoperative pain. In a cohort of 140 women who had undergone breast cancer surgery, and were assigned based on a 3-year follow-up to either a persistent or non-persistent pain phenotype, the role of epigenetic regulation of key players in the glial-opioid interface was assessed. The methylation of genes coding for the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a major mediator of glial contributions to persistent pain or for the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) was analyzed and its association with the pain phenotype was compared with that conferred by global genome-wide DNA methylation assessed via quantification of the methylation in the retrotransposon LINE1. Training of machine learning algorithms indicated that the global DNA methylation provided a similar diagnostic accuracy for persistent pain as previously established non-genetic predictors. However, the diagnosis can be based on a single DNA based marker. By contrast, the methylation of TLR4 or OPRM1 genes could not contribute further to the allocation of the patients to the pain-related phenotype groups. While clearly supporting a predictive utility of epigenetic testing, the present analysis cannot provide support for specific epigenetic modulation of persistent postoperative pain via methylation of two key genes of the glial-opioid interface.",Clinical Epigenetics,journal,['JournalArticle'],310fa781-1f4e-487d-a580-d8e99f5c81b7,Clinical Epigenetics,,11,N/A,2019,2019-11-27 00:00:00,11,86,"D.

However, there has been disagreement regarding the factor structure of the GAD-7, and there is a need for larger studies investigating the psychometric properties of the measure. Patients undergoing treatment (N = 1201), both inpatient and outpatient patients, completed the GAD-7 at pre- and post-treatment. Measures of depression, well-being, and other anxiety measures were also completed, making it possible to investigate convergent and divergent validity. Internal consistency and convergent validity were excellent for the total sample, and there was acceptable variation related to treatment groups. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a random sample (50%) of the patients at intake and then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the factor structure in the other part of the sample at intake. The EFA indicated a clear one-factor solution, but the one-factor solution with CFA provided a poor fit to the data. Correlating the residuals among items assessing somatic symptoms led to a good fit in a respecified CFA solution.

This study aimed at developing a predictor model to estimate time on a kidney transplant waiting list using a machine learning approach. Methods A retrospective cohort study including data of patients registered, between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, in the waiting list of São Paulo State Organ Allocation System (SP-OAS) /Brazil. Data were randomly divided into two groups: 75% for training and 25% for testing. A Cox regression model was fitted with deceased donor transplant as the outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different Cox models. Cox hazard ratios were used to develop the risk-prediction equations. Results Of 54,055 records retrieved, 48,153 registries were included in the final analysis. During the study period, approximately 1/3 of the patients were transplanted with a deceased donor. The major characteristics associated with changes in the likelihood of transplantation were age, subregion, cPRA, and frequency of HLA-DR, -B and -A.

We retrospectively evaluated the data of kidney transplant procedures until hospital discharge, according to kidney function recovery after the procedure. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the non-sensitized, 1st KTx from deceased donors performed between Jan/2010 to Dec/2017. Results: Out of the 1300 KTx from deceased donors performed in this period, 730 patients were studied and divided into 3 groups: Immediate Renal Function (IRF) - decrease in serum creatinine ≥ 10% on two consecutive days; Delayed Graft Function (DGF) - decrease in serum creatinine <10% on two consecutive days, without the need for dialysis, and Dialysis (D) - need for dialysis during the first week. Patients in group D stayed longer in the hospital compared to DGF and IRF (21, 11 and 8 days respectively, p < 0.001). More D patients (21%) were admitted to the ICU and performed a greater number of laboratory tests (p < 0.001) and renal biopsies (p < 0.001), in addition to receiving a higher amount of immunosuppressants. Total hospital costs were higher in group D and DGF compared to IRF (U$ 7.021,48; U$ 3.603,42 and U$ 2.642,37 respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The costs of the transplant procedure is impacted by the recovery of kidney function after the transplant. The reimbursement for each of these different kidney function outcomes should be individualized in order to cover their real costs.",Jornal Brasileiro De Nefrologia,journal,['JournalArticle'],357835a3-b31b-4c10-af51-1de90b42cee9,Jornal Brasileiro de Nefrologia,375 - 382,43,N/A,2021,2021-04-23 00:00:00,2,20,"R.

Despite this success, the high risk of premature death and frequent occurrence of graft failure remain important clinical and research challenges. The current burst of studies and other innovative initiatives using artificial intelligence (AI) for a wide range of analytical and practical applications in biomedical areas seems to correlate with the same trend observed in publications in the kidney transplantation field, and points toward the potential of such novel approaches to address the aforementioned aim of improving long-term outcomes of kidney transplant recipients (KTR). However, at the same time, this trend underscores now more than ever the old methodological challenges and potential threats that the research and clinical community needs to be aware of and actively look after with regard to AI-driven evidence. The purpose of this narrative mini-review is to explore challenges for obtaining applicable and adequate kidney transplant data for analyses using AI techniques to develop prediction models, and to propose next steps in the field. We make a call to act toward establishing the strong collaborations needed to bring innovative synergies further augmented by AI, which have the potential to impact the long-term care of KTR. We encourage researchers and clinicians to submit their invaluable research, including original clinical and imaging studies, database studies from registries, meta-analyses, and AI research in the kidney transplantation field.",Transplantology,journal,['Review'],b1053301-2994-4467-922f-a4367851a5e8,Transplantology,118-128,2,N/A,2021,2021-04-06 00:00:00,2,58,"Raúl Castillo-Astorga, Camilo G.

In organ transplantation, delayed graft function (DGF) remains a major concern in deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT). To this end, we harnessed ML to build personalized prognostic models to predict DGF. Registry data were obtained on adult DDKT recipients for model development (n = 55,044) and validation (n = 6176). Incidence rates of DGF were 25.1% and 26.3% for the development and validation sets, respectively. Twenty-six predictors were identified via recursive feature elimination with random forest. Five widely-used ML algorithms—logistic regression (LR), elastic net, random forest, artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were trained and compared with a baseline LR model fitted with previously identified risk factors. The new ML models, particularly ANN with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.732 and XGB with ROC-AUC of 0.735, exhibited superior performance to the baseline model (ROC-AUC = 0.705). This study demonstrates the use of ML as a viable strategy to enable personalized risk quantification for medical applications.

Early prediction of subclinical mastitis can enable dairy farmers to perform interventions to mitigate its effect. The present study investigated how well predictive models built using machine learning techniques can detect subclinical mastitis up to 7 d before its occurrence. The data set used consisted of 1,346,207 milk-day (i.e., a day when milk was collected on both morning and evening) records spanning 9 yr from 2,389 cows producing on 7 Irish research farms. Individual cow composite milk yield and maximum milk flow were available twice daily, whereas milk composition (i.e., fat, lactose, protein) and somatic cell count (SCC) were collected once per week. Other features describing parity, calving dates, predicted transmitting ability for SCC, body weight, and history of subclinical mastitis were also available. The results of the study showed that a gradient boosting machine model trained to predict the onset of subclinical mastitis 7 d before a subclinical case occurs achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 69.45 and 95.64%, respectively. Reduced data collection frequency, where milk composition and SCC were recorded only every 15, 30, 45, and 60 d was simulated by masking data, to reflect the frequency of recording of this data on commercial dairy farms in Ireland. The sensitivity and specificity scores reduced as recording frequency reduced with respective scores of 66.93 and 80.43% when milk composition and SCC were recorded just every 60 d. Results demonstrate that models built on data that could be recorded routinely available on commercial dairy farms, can achieve useful predictive ability of subclinical mastitis even with reduced frequency of milk composition and SCC recording.",Journal of Dairy Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],7da561cd-ebc2-42ae-96b3-244a5c401c38,Journal of dairy science,,,N/A,2023,2023-05-31 00:00:00,10,51,"A.

We determined the presence of a significant relationship between the udder surface skin temperature and the milk yield of mastitis cows (Coefficient of determination = 0.886, linear Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.96), as well as the absence of a significant relationship between the udder surface skin temperature and the milk yield of healthy cows (Coefficient of determination = 0.029, linear Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.16). We substantiated the temperature ranges of the udder surface of healthy cows [32–35.9 °C] and mastitis [36.1–39 °C].

In this study, we adopt eight machine learning algorithms using an R software for analyzing a dataset of 14-dimensions of dairy cows with health disorders across the whole lactation period in intensive Chinese dairy farms, applying automatic monitoring systems and milking systems. The variables analyzed by the machine learning algorithms include milk yield, physical activity, changes in rumination time, and the electrical conductivity of milk. Six parameters were presented to evaluate the performance metrics of the models, with the Rpart algorithm outperforming others and indicating a strong generalization ability of this algorithm. A total of 10 variables of greater importance in three models of Rpart, eXtreme Gradient, and Adaboost demonstrated the consistency of those variables as predictors for disorders of dairy cows monitored by automatic systems. The results obtained in this study highlighted the importance of using big data on the farm to develop predictive and prescriptive decision support tools to boost the development of precision livestock farming. Abstract We use multidimensional data from automated monitoring systems and milking systems to predict disorders of dairy cows by employing eight machine learning algorithms. The data included the season, days in milking, parity, age at the time of disorders, milk yield (kg/day), activity (unitless), six variables related to rumination time, and two variables related to the electrical conductivity of milk. We analyze 131 sick cows and 149 healthy cows with identical lactation days and parity; all data are collected on the same day, which corresponds to the diagnosis day for disordered cows. For disordered cows, each variable, except the ratio of rumination time from daytime to nighttime, displays a decreasing/increasing trend from d-7 or d-3 to d0 and/or d-1, with the d0, d-1, or d-2 values reaching the minimum or maximum. The test data sensitivity for three algorithms exceeded 80%, and the accuracies of the eight algorithms ranged from 65.08% to 84.21%. The area under the curve (AUC) of the three algorithms was >80%. Overall, Rpart best predicts the disorders with an accuracy, precision, and AUC of 81.58%, 92.86%, and 0.908, respectively.

The objective was to evaluate UST by infrared thermography (IRT) as a diagnostic tool for SCM and intramammary infection (IMI), and to assess the influence of environmental conditions in the potential diagnosis of this disease in dairy cows located at high-altitude tropical regions. A total of 105 cows (397 quarters) from 3 dairy farms with mechanical and manual milking methods were enrolled in the study. Subclinical mastitis was diagnosed when quarter samples had a somatic cell count (SCC) ≥200 × 103 cells/mL, microbial growth (MG) was defined when a major pathogen (≥1 cfu/plate) or Corynebacterium spp. (≥10 cfu/plate) was isolated, and IMI was defined as the presence of MG and SCC ≥100 × 103 cells/mL. Infrared images were taken with a thermal camera placed 1 m away from the udder, and shots of the rear and left and right lateral view were made during the morning milking, before any manipulation of the udder and employing dark cardboard on the contralateral side to avoid artifacts in the background. A multilevel mixed effects linear regression model clustered within cows and herd was performed to evaluate the associations with UST. Clinical performance was evaluated using the Youden index to establish the optimum UST thresholds, which were set at 32.6°C for any case definition when milking was by hand, at 33.7°C for MG, and at 34°C for SCM and IMI in machine-milked quarters. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), area under curve (AUC), and positive likelihood ratio (+LR) were also assessed. Test agreement was assessed by kappa coefficient (κ). The UST of healthy quarters ranged between (95% CI) 32.4 and 32.6°C, lower than SCM quarters (n = 88) at 32.9°C (95% CI: 32.7-33.1 °C), MG quarters (n = 56) at 33.5°C (95% CI: 33.3-33.7°C), and IMI quarters (n = 50) at 33.5°C (95% CI: 33.2-33.7 °C). The UST was also related to the milking method: higher temperatures were observed for hand milking (n = 90) compared with machine milking (n = 185). No relation between environmental conditions such as wind speed, atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, and temperature-humidity index and UST were observed during this study. For hand milking, the optimal UST threshold was 32.6°C; for SCM, Se = 0.53, Sp = 0.89, AUC = 0.71, κ = 0.4; for MG, Se = 0.83, Sp = 0.93, AUC = 0.88, κ = 0.77; and for IMI, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.92, AUC = 0.87, κ = 0.74. The machine milking threshold for SCM resulted in Se = 0.42, Sp = 0.97, AUC = 0.70, κ = 0.47; for MG, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.89, AUC = 0.85, κ = 0.60; and for IMI, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.98, AUC = 0.90, κ = 0.79. These findings suggest that UST determined by IRT is higher in machine-milked cows and in quarters with MG and IMI than in healthy quarters; therefore, UST by IRT is a reliable, clinically useful method for MG and IMI diagnosis.",Journal of Dairy Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],7da561cd-ebc2-42ae-96b3-244a5c401c38,Journal of dairy science,,,N/A,2021,2021-06-24 00:00:00,28,66,"J.

We find that the population-wide imprints like the location of the “evaporation valley” in the distance–radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution clearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with the observed position of the valley suggests that close-in low-mass Kepler planets have a predominantly Earth-like rocky composition. Combined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that low-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline but were still undergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets losing all primordial H/He. For planets in this “triangle of evaporation” in the distance–radius plane, the degeneracy in composition is reduced. In the observed planetary mass–mean density diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with an increasing radius (R/R⊕ ≲ 1.6 rocky; 1.6–3.0 ices, and/or H/He; ≳3: H/He). The mass–density diagram contains important information about formation and evolution. Its characteristic broken V-shape reveals the transitions from solid planets to low-mass core-dominated planets with H/He and finally to gas-dominated giants. Evaporation causes the density and orbital distance to be anticorrelated for low-mass planets in contrast to giants, where closer-in planets are less dense, likely due to inflation. The temporal evolution of the statistical properties reported here will be of interest for the PLATO 2.0 mission, which will observe the temporal dimension.",,Unknown,,Unknown,The Astrophysical Journal,,853,Unknown,2017,2017-06-01 00:00:00,176,125,"Sheng Jin, C.

Within the fields of urology and gynecology, conditions such as overactive bladder (OAB) and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) have been identified as crucial concerns due to their negative impact on the quality of life of elderly individuals. In this study, we investigated the potential of Ninjin'yoeito (NYT), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, as a viable treatment option for frailty. Additionally, we hypothesized that NYT may also contribute to the improvement of symptoms associated with OAB and GSM, and potentially help in reducing the dosage of OAB medications. Methods In this retrospective cohort study conducted from November 2016 to November 2022, we created a website describing the relationship between frailty and genitourinary symptoms in frail patients aged ≥ 65 years with GSM who underwent pelvic floor muscle training. The patients were divided into two propensity score-matched groups: NYT group (received NYT for one year) and no-NYT group (did not receive NYT), based on their wishes. The fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight (FRAIL) scale was used to assess frailty status. Urinary symptoms were evaluated using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). Genital symptoms were investigated using the vaginal health index score and vulvodynia swab test. The value of each score was obtained before (T0) and 12 months after (T12) treatment, and the difference (ΔT0/T12) was calculated. Results During the study period, 985 outpatients visited our clinic, of whom 725 were considered frail/pre-frail; 402 women with frailty/pre-frailty (mean age 77.5 ± 6.49 years) were included, with a median follow-up of 14.5 months. The NYT and no-NYT groups had 220 and 182 patients, respectively. After propensity score matching, each group had 159 patients. ΔT0/T12FRAIL scale score was significantly higher in the NYT group (0.13 ± 0.37) than in the no-NYT (0.01 ± 0.10) group (p=0.001.) However, urinary symptoms improved in the NYT group more than in the no-NYT in terms of the following parameters: ΔT0/T12OABSS (NYT: 0.89 ± 1.65; no-NYTl: 0.36 ± 1.14, p=0.001) and ΔT0/T12ICIQ-SF score (NYT: 1.51 ± 1.75; no-NYT: 0.42 ± 1.18, p<0.001). Genital symptoms were better in the NYT group in terms of ΔT0/T12VHIS (NYT: 0.58 ±1.08; no-NYT: 0.21 ±0.65, p<0.001). The vulvodynia swab test showed improvements in left para-hymen evoked pain in both groups. In the NYT group, 5% of the patients underwent antimuscarinic drug dose reduction for overactive bladder treatment. NYT use was not associated with significant side effects, and only 0.6% of patients reported drug allergies. Conclusion NYT improved activity levels in frail/pre-frail patients. Moreover, NYT use improved various genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with frailty/pre-frailty. Treatment with NYT may reduce the dose of overactive bladder medications. The anticholinergic load-reducing effect of NYT may help solve the problem of polypharmacy.",Cureus,journal,['JournalArticle'],87c855fc-c59a-4443-832a-e5b1ca14b9f3,Cureus,,15,N/A,2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,7,30,"N.

To address this issue, more and more researchers are examining the relationship between OAB treatment and urinary microecology. In this study, we sought to determine whether differences in treatment efficacy were related to microbiome diversity and composition as well as the abundance of specific genera. Machine learning algorithms were used to construct predictive models for urine microbiota-based treatment of OAB. Methods Urine samples were obtained from 64 adult female OAB patients for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients’ overactive bladder symptom scores (OABSS) were collected before and after mirabegron treatment and patients were divided into effective and ineffective groups. The relationship between the relative abundance of certain genera and OABSS were analyzed. Three machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), supporting vector machine (SVM) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were utilized to predict the therapeutic effect of mirabegron based on the relative abundance of certain genera in OAB patients’ urine microbiome. Results The species composition of the two groups differed. For one, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly higher in the effective group than in the ineffective group. In addition, the relative abundance of Gardnerella and Prevotella in the effective group was significantly lower than in the ineffective group. Alpha-diversity and beta-diversity differed significantly between the two groups. LEfSe analysis revealed that Lactobacillus abundance increased while Prevotella and Gardnerella abundance decreased in the effective group. The Lactobacillus abundance ROC curve had high predictive accuracy. The OABSS after treatment was negatively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus, whereas the relationship between OABSS and Prevotella and Gardnerella showed the opposite trend. In addition, RF, SVM and XGBoost models demonstrated high predictive ability to assess the effect of mirabegron in OAB patients in the test cohort. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that urinary microbiota might influence the efficacy of mirabegron, and that Lactobacillus might be a potential marker for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of mirabegron in OAB patients.",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,journal,['JournalArticle'],a19f6357-d8f7-4235-8304-c659c68ca126,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,12,N/A,2022,2022-11-14 00:00:00,6,33,"Zhipeng Zhou, Yifeng Qiu, Kun Li, Qi Sun, Ming Xie, Pengcheng Huang, Y.

Given the rapidly increasing proportion of older adults in Japan, a better understanding of the relationship between frailty and OAB is needed to inform future healthcare planning. This study assessed the association between frailty and OAB in older adults in Japan and evaluated the impact on their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods This was a cross-sectional re-contact study of respondents who previously completed the National Health and Wellness Survey 2018 in Japan. Participants were aged ≥65 years and Japanese speakers and readers. As part of a customized online survey, participants were screened for frailty using the Kihon Checklist (frail = scores ≥8 points) and OAB using the overactive bladder symptom score (OAB = total score ≥ 3 points and ≥ 2 points on question 3). The primary endpoint was the odds ratio of frailty in older adults with and without OAB assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model. Secondary endpoints were the prevalence rates of OAB and frailty. Exploratory endpoints assessed HRQoL using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Survey Instrument version 2 (SF-12v2). Results Overall, 2953 participants were included: 150 (5.1%) were frail OAB, 416 (14.1%) non-frail OAB, 287 (9.7%) frail non-OAB, and 2100 (71.1%) non-frail non-OAB. There was a statistically significant correlation between frailty and OAB demonstrated by an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.78 (2.18–3.54; p  <  0.001). The prevalence (95% CI) of OAB was 34.3% (29.9–38.8) in frail and 16.5% (15.1–18.0) in non-frail older adults; the prevalence of frailty was 26.5% (22.9–30.1) and 12.0% (10.7–13.3) in older adults with and without OAB. HRQoL was assessed in 150 participants per group. The adjusted HRQoL analyses showed significantly lower scores in participants who were frail OAB vs. frail non-OAB for most of the SF-12v2 scores/sub-component scores. Conclusions These data highlight the statistically significant positive correlation between frailty and OAB among older adults in Japan and may provide valuable information on the burden of OAB and frailty on older adults to healthcare professionals when considering future healthcare planning.",BMC Geriatrics,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",f0ed97d4-5d9b-4cb1-892a-ae0f91b368bc,BMC Geriatrics,,22,N/A,2022,2022-01-21 00:00:00,9,37,"Masaki Yoshida, S.

Methods PD-L1 and mismatch repair protein (MMR) expression in cancer cells and the density of TAIC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 89 SCNEC patients. The combined positive score (CPS), tumor proportion score (TPS), and immune cell score (ICS) of PD-L1 were measured, along with their correlation with clinicopathologic features in SCNEC patients using statistical analyses. Results CPS of PD-L1 ≥ 1 was seen in 68.5% of patients, positive TPS and ICS of PD-L1 were detected in 59.6% and 33.7% of patients, respectively. PD-L1 CPS was higher in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (r = 0.387, p  = 0.001) and positively correlated with programmed cell death-1 and forkhead box P3 + regulatory T cell (FOXP3 + Treg) infiltration (r = 0.443, p  < 0.001; r = 0.532, p  < 0.001). There was no statistical correlation between PD-L1 and MMR status. PD-L1 CPS and PD-L1 ICS positivity were independent prognostic factors, correlating with a favorable survival (HR (95%CI) = 0.363(0.139–0.950), p  = 0.039 and HR (95% CI) = 0.199(0.050–0.802), p  = 0.023, respectively). PD-L1 ICS positivity was an independent indicator of recurrence in SCNEC patients and associated with better disease-free survival (HR (95% CI) = 0.124(0.036–0425), p  = 0.001). TAIC and MMR levels had no statistical impact on survival results. Conclusions PD-L1 positivity was seen in over half of SCNEC tumors. It may work synergistically with FOXP3 + Treg and other infiltrating immune cells to support an adaptive immune response. PD-L1 positivity may be a favorable prognostic factor in SCNEC.",Cancer Cell International,journal,['JournalArticle'],f8480fcc-dd9e-4c09-9baf-78df5a6881cd,Cancer Cell International,,22,N/A,2022,2022-11-14 00:00:00,10,50,"Xiaoying Sun, Lili Liu, T.

Methods A total of 11,370 computed tomograms (CT), deriving from 137 cases, of lung cancer patients under radiotherapy developed by radiotherapists were used as the training set; 1642 CT images in 20 cases were used as the validation set, and 1685 CT images in 20 cases were used as the test set. The proposed network was tuned and trained to obtain the best segmentation model and its performance was measured by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and with 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95). Lastly, as to demonstrate the accuracy of the automatic segmentation of the network proposed in this study, all possible mirrors of the input images were put into Unet2D, Unet2.5D, Unet3D, ResSEUnet3D, ResSEUnet2.5D, and TransResUnet2.5D, and their respective segmentation performances were compared and assessed. Results The segmentation results of the test set showed that TransResSEUnet2.5D performed the best in the DSC (84.08 ± 0.04) %, HD95 (8.11 ± 3.43) mm and time (6.50 ± 1.31) s metrics compared to the other three networks.

Methods A total of 233 lung adenocarcinoma patients were investigated and randomly divided into the training and test cohorts. In this study, 2300 radiomic features were extracted from original and filtered (Exponential, Laplacian of Gaussian, Logarithm, Gabor, Wavelet) CT images. The radiomic features were divided into four categories, including histogram, volumetric, morphologic, and texture features. An RF-BFE algorithm was developed to select the features for building the prediction models. Clinicopathological features (including age, gender, smoking status, TNM staging, maximum diameter, location, and growth pattern) were combined to establish an integrated model with radiomic features. ROC curve and AUC quantified the effectiveness of the predictor of EGFR mutation status and subtypes. Results A set of 10 features were selected to predict EGFR mutation status between EGFR mutant and wild type, while 9 selected features were used to predict mutation subtypes between exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation. To predict the EGFR mutation status, the AUC of the training cohort was 0.778 and the AUC of the test cohort was 0.765. To predict the EGFR mutation subtypes, the AUC of training cohort was 0.725 and the AUC of test cohort was 0.657. The integrated model showed the most optimal predictive performance with EGFR mutation status (AUC = 0.870 and 0.759) and subtypes (AUC = 0.797 and 0.554) in the training and test cohorts. Conclusion CT-based radiomic features can extract information on tumor heterogeneity in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we have established a radiomic model and an integrated model to non-invasively predict the EGFR mutation status and subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, which is conducive to saving clinical costs and guiding targeted therapy.",OncoTargets and Therapy,journal,['JournalArticle'],a3c92136-86d8-407a-9c91-45bd53eb2c77,OncoTargets and therapy,597 - 608,15,N/A,2022,2022-05-01 00:00:00,5,37,"Quan Chen, Yan Li, Qiguang Cheng, Juno S.

The surgical strategy of lymph node dissection is controversial because many more patients are diagnosed at an early stage in clinical practice. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 622 clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma patients with 3 cm or less in tumor size who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy combined with lymph node dissection in our hospital from January 2017 to December 2019. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify preoperative risk factors of lymph node metastasis. Results Lymph node metastasis was found in 60 out of 622 patients. On univariate analysis, lymph node metastasis was linked to smoking history, preoperative CEA level, tumor size, tumor location (peripheral or central), consolidation/tumor ratio, pleural invasion, and pathologic type. However, only the preoperative CEA level, tumor size, and consolidation/tumor ratio were independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. The ROC curve showed that the cutoff value of tumor size was 1.7 cm. There was no lymph node metastasis in patients without risk factors. Conclusions The preoperative CEA level, tumor size, and consolidation/tumor ratio were independent risk factors of lymph node metastasis in clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma with tumor size ≤ 3 cm. The lymph node metastasis rate was extremely low in clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma patients without risk factors and lymph node dissection should be avoided in these patients to reduce surgical trauma.",BMC Surgery,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",bc44c99c-57c5-4494-9139-7bc84ae182bf,BMC Surgery,,22,N/A,2022,2022-04-29 00:00:00,7,24,"C.

Transfer learning can bridge between a source domain with rich sample data and a target domain with only a few or zero labeled samples and, thus, complete the transfer of knowledge by aligning the distribution between domains through methods, such as domain adaptation. Previous domain adaptation methods mostly align the features in the feature space of all categories on a global scale. Recently, the method of locally aligning the sub-categories by introducing label information achieved better results. Based on this, we present a deep fuzzy domain adaptation (DFDA) that assigns different weights to samples of the same category in the source and target domains, which enhances the domain adaptive capabilities.

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.

A total of 263 pathologically confirmed LNs from 124 patients with NCSLC were retrospectively analyzed. Positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examination was performed before treatment according to the clinical schedule. In the training cohort (N = 185), malignancy-related features, such as SUVmax, short-axis diameter (SAD), and CT radiomics features, were extracted from the regions of LN based on the PET/CT scan. The Minimum-Redundancy Maximum-Relevance (mRMR) algorithm and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model were used for feature selection and radiomics score building. The radiomics score (Rad-Score) and SUVmax were incorporated in a PET/CT nomogram using the multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated with discrimination, calibration, and clinical application in an independent testing cohort (N = 78). The radiomics scores consisting of 14 selected features were significantly associated with LN status for both training cohort with AUC of 0.849 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.796–0.903) and testing cohort with AUC of 0.828 (95% CI, 0.782–0.919). The PET/CT nomogram incorporating radiomics score and SUVmax showed moderate improvement of the efficiency with AUC of 0.881 (95% CI, 0.834–0.928) in the training cohort and AUC of 0.872 (95% CI, 0.797–0.946) in the testing cohort. The decision curve analysis indicated that the PET/CT nomogram was clinically useful. The PET/CT nomogram, which incorporates Rad-Score and SUVmax, can improve the diagnostic performance of LN metastasis. • The PET/CT nomogram (Int-Score) based on lymph node (LN) PET/CT images can reliably predict LN status in NSCLC. • Int-Score is a relatively objective diagnostic method, which can play an auxiliary role in the process of clinicians making treatment decisions.",European Radiology,journal,['JournalArticle'],47f41409-58e8-4cf2-b8cb-2470d27e901a,European Radiology,6030 - 6038,31,N/A,2021,2021-02-09 00:00:00,28,41,"Yunming Xie, Hongguang Zhao, Yan Guo, Fanyang Meng, Xiangchun Liu, Yiying Zhang, Xiaochen Huai, Qianting Wong, Yu Fu, Huimao Zhang","1410065415, 2146230810, 1563102326, 1484123869, 49543377, 1591119167, 114081113, 2048044455, 2118638103, 102551870",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a381197684b03657b91021da22a99eccf82b40d9,Medicine,1410065415

However, the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same time, which leads to unsatisfactory results. To mitigate this problem, we propose PairRE, a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. The paired vectors enable an adaptive adjustment of the margin in loss function to fit for different complex relations. Besides, PairRE is capable of encoding three important relation patterns, symmetry/antisymmetry, inverse and composition. Given simple constraints on relation representations, PairRE can encode subrelation further. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities of PairRE.

This cross-sectional study used QGIS and GeoDa to explore the spatial pattern and heterogeneity of CRDs morbidity and spatial autocorrelation between socio-demographic factors and CRDs in Thailand from 2016 to 2019. We found an annual, positive, spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I >0.66, p<0.001) showing a strong clustered distribution. The local indicators of spatial association (LISA) identified hotspots mostly in the northern region, while coldspots were mostly seen in the central and north-eastern regions throughout the study period. Of the socio-demographic factors, the density of population, households, vehicles, factories and agricultural areas, correlated with the CRD morbidity rate, with statistically significant negative spatial autocorrelations and coldspots in the north-eastern and central areas (except for agricultural land) and two hotspots between farm household density and CRD in the southern region in 2019.

In this paper, we extend deviance measures to mixtures of GLMs, whose parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) via the EM algorithm. Such measures are defined both locally, i.e., at cluster-level, and globally, i.e., with reference to the whole sample. At the cluster-level, we propose a normalized two-term decomposition of the local deviance into explained, and unexplained local deviances. At the sample-level, we introduce an additive normalized decomposition of the total deviance into three terms, where each evaluates a different aspect of the fitted model: (1) the cluster separation on the dependent variable, (2) the proportion of the total deviance explained by the fitted model, and (3) the proportion of the total deviance which remains unexplained. We use both local and global decompositions to define, respectively, local and overall deviance R ^2 measures for mixtures of GLMs, which we illustrate—for Gaussian, Poisson and binomial responses—by means of a simulation study. The proposed fit measures are then used to assess, and interpret clusters of COVID-19 spread in Italy in two time points.",Journal of Classification,journal,['JournalArticle'],1a82d65a-d5fa-4f7a-a059-8a65e4c446be,Journal of Classification,1 - 34,,N/A,2023,2023-04-04 00:00:00,7,50,"Roberto Di Mari, S.

Therefore, the ability to correctly and quickly predict the effect of amino acid mutations is crucial for understanding disease effects and to be able to carry out genome-wide studies. Here, we report a new development of the SAAMBE method, SAAMBE-3D, which is a machine learning-based approach, resulting in accurate predictions and is extremely fast. It achieves the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 0.82 depending on the training protocol in benchmarking five-fold validation test against the SKEMPI v2.0 database and outperforms currently existing algorithms on various blind-tests. Furthermore, optimized and tested via five-fold cross-validation on the Cornell University dataset, the SAAMBE-3D achieves AUC of 1.0 and 0.96 on a homo and hereto-dimer test datasets. Another important feature of SAAMBE-3D is that it is very fast, it takes less than a fraction of a second to complete a prediction. SAAMBE-3D is available as a web server and as well as a stand-alone code, the last one being another important feature allowing other researchers to directly download the code and run it on their local computer. Combined all together, SAAMBE-3D is an accurate and fast software applicable for genome-wide studies to assess the effect of amino acid mutations on protein–protein interactions. The webserver and the stand-alone codes (SAAMBE-3D for predicting the change of binding free energy and SAAMBE-3D-DN for predicting if the mutation is disruptive or non-disruptive) are available.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,journal,['JournalArticle'],8506a01a-40b8-4e6f-bbb8-ce2492139c15,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,21,N/A,2020,2020-04-01 00:00:00,69,61,"S.

To this end, several methods have been developed to predict changes in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding (∆∆G) between wild type and variant proteins, using sequence and structure information. Most of the available methods however do not exhibit the anti-symmetric prediction property, which guarantees that the predicted ∆∆G value for a variation is the exact opposite of that predicted for the reverse variation, i.e., ∆∆G(A → B) = −∆∆G(B → A), where A and B are amino acids. Here we introduce simple anti-symmetric features, based on evolutionary information, which are combined to define an untrained method, DDGun (DDG untrained). DDGun is a simple approach based on evolutionary information that predicts the ∆∆G for single and multiple variations from sequence and structure information (DDGun3D). Our method achieves remarkable performance without any training on the experimental datasets, reaching Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and measured ∆∆G values of ~ 0.5 and ~ 0.4 for single and multiple site variations, respectively. Surprisingly, DDGun performances are comparable with those of state of the art methods. DDGun also naturally predicts multiple site variations, thereby defining a benchmark method for both single site and multiple site predictors. DDGun is anti-symmetric by construction predicting the value of the ∆∆G of a reciprocal variation as almost equal (depending on the sequence profile) to -∆∆G of the direct variation. This is a valuable property that is missing in the majority of the methods. Evolutionary information alone combined in an untrained method can achieve remarkably high performances in the prediction of ∆∆G upon protein mutation. Non-trained approaches like DDGun represent a valid benchmark both for scoring the predictive power of the individual features and for assessing the learning capability of supervised methods.",BMC Bioinformatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],be3f884c-b44a-496a-a593-1cad3f89d254,BMC Bioinformatics,,20,N/A,2019,2019-07-01 00:00:00,109,43,"Ludovica Montanucci, E.

Experimental evidence associates amino acid substitutions of the FXN to Friedreich Ataxia, a neurodegenerative disorder. Recently, new thermodynamic experiments have been performed to study the impact of somatic variations identified in cancer tissues on protein stability. The Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) data provider at the University of Rome measured the unfolding free energy of a set of variants (FXN challenge data set) with far‐UV circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectra. These values have been used to calculate the change in unfolding free energy between the variant and wild‐type proteins at zero concentration of denaturant (ΔΔGH2O) . The FXN challenge data set, composed of eight amino acid substitutions, was used to evaluate the performance of the current computational methods for predicting the ΔΔGH2O value associated with the variants and to classify them as destabilizing and not destabilizing. For the fifth edition of CAGI, six independent research groups from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America submitted 12 sets of predictions from different approaches.

Typically based on signal strength measurement, a power level map is created first in the learning phase to align with measured values in the inference. Second, the location is determined by taking the point for which the recorded received power level is closest to the power level actually measured. The biggest limit of this technique is the reliability of power measurements, which may lack accuracy in many wireless systems. To this end, this work extends the power level measurement by using multiple anchors and multiple radio channels and, consequently, considers different approaches to aligning the actual measurements with the recorded values. The dataset is available online. This article focuses on the very popular radio technology Bluetooth Low Energy to explore the possible improvement of the system accuracy through different machine learning approaches. It shows how the accuracy–complexity trade-off influences the possible candidate algorithms on an example of three-channel Bluetooth received signal strength based fingerprinting in a one dimensional environment with four static anchors and in a two dimensional environment with the same set of anchors. We provide a literature survey to identify the machine learning algorithms applied in the literature to show that the studies available can not be compared directly. Then, we implement and analyze the performance of four most popular supervised learning techniques, namely k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. In our scenario, the most promising machine learning technique being the Random Forest with classification accuracy over 99%.",Italian National Conference on Sensors,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",3dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",,21,20213dbf084c-ef47-4b74-9919-047b40704538,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,37,44,"L.

Despite the significant benefits of this technique, it needs a considerable amount of time and energy to measure the Received Signal Strength (RSS) at Reference Points (RPs) and build a fingerprinting database to achieve an appropriate localization accuracy. Reducing the number of RPs can reduce this cost, but it noticeably degrades the accuracy of positioning. In order to alleviate this problem, this paper takes the interior architecture of the indoor area and signal propagation effects into account and proposes two novel recovery methods for creating the reconstructed database instead of the measured one. They only need a few numbers of RPs to reconstruct the database and even are able to produce a denser database. The first method is a new zone-based path-loss propagation model which employs fingerprints of different zones separately and the second one is a new interpolation method, zone-based Weighted Ring-based (WRB). The proposed methods are compared with the conventional path-loss model and six interpolation functions. Two different test environments along with a benchmarking testbed, and various RPs configurations are also utilized to verify the proposed recovery methods, based on the reconstruction errors and the localization accuracies they provide. The results indicate that by taking only 11% of the initial RPs, the new zone-based path-loss model decreases the localization error up to 26% compared to the conventional path-loss model and the proposed zone-based WRB method outperforms all the other interpolation methods and improves the accuracy by 40%.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,104462-104477,7,N/A,2019,2019-07-30 00:00:00,34,48,"Vahideh Moghtadaiee, S.

Previous work indicated that these reads are characterized by erroneous split-read support that is interpreted as evidence of structural variants. Thus, a large number of false-positive structural variants are detected. To our knowledge, no tool is currently available to specifically call or filter structural variants in FFPE samples. To overcome this gap, we developed 2 R packages: SimFFPE and FilterFFPE. Results SimFFPE is a read simulator, specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data from FFPE samples. A mixture of characteristic artifact chimeric reads, as well as normal reads, is generated. FilterFFPE is a filtration algorithm, removing artifact chimeric reads from sequencing data while keeping real chimeric reads. To evaluate the performance of FilterFFPE, we performed structural variant calling with 3 common tools (Delly, Lumpy, and Manta) with and without prior filtration with FilterFFPE. After applying FilterFFPE, the mean positive predictive value improved from 0.27 to 0.48 in simulated samples and from 0.11 to 0.27 in real samples, while sensitivity remained basically unchanged or even slightly increased. Conclusions FilterFFPE improves the performance of SV calling in FFPE samples.

Nowadays, targeted therapies are based primarily on the detection of mutations, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) plays an important role in relevant clinical research. The mutation frequency is a major problem in tumor mutation detection and increasing sequencing depth is a widely used method to improve mutation calling performance. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of different sequencing depth and mutation frequency as well as mutation calling tools. In this study, Strelka2 and Mutect2 tools were used in detecting the performance of 30 combinations of sequencing depth and mutation frequency. Results showed that the precision rate kept greater than 95% in most of the samples. Generally, for higher mutation frequency (≥20%), sequencing depth ≥200X is sufficient for calling 95% mutations; for lower mutation frequency (≤10%), we recommend improving experimental method rather than increasing sequencing depth. Besides, according to our results, although Strelka2 and Mutect2 performed similarly, the former performed slightly better than the latter one at higher mutation frequency (≥20%), while Mutect2 performed better when the mutation frequency was lower than 10%. Besides, Strelka2 was 17 to 22 times faster than Mutect2 on average. Our research will provide a useful and comprehensive guideline for clinical genomic researches on somatic mutation identification through systematic performance comparison among different sequencing depths and mutation frequency.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,N/A,2020,2020-02-26 00:00:00,53,57,"Zixi Chen, Yuchen Yuan, Xiaoshi Chen, Jiayun Chen, Shudai Lin, Xingsong Li, H.

Many hospitals, however, collect and store Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Consequently, the sample size of whole genome cancer cohort studies could be increased tremendously by including FFPE samples, although the presence of artefacts might obfuscate the variant calling. To assess whether FFPE material can be used for cohort studies, we performed an in-depth comparison of somatic SNVs called on matching FF and FFPE Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) samples extracted from the same tumor. Four variant callers (i.e. Strelka2, Mutect2, VarScan2 and Shimmer) were used to call somatic variants on matching FF and FFPE WGS samples from a metastatic prostate tumor. Using the variants identified by these callers, we developed a heuristic to maximize the overlap between the FF and its FFPE counterpart in terms of sensitivity and precision. The proposed variant calling approach was then validated on nine matched primary samples. Finally, we assessed what fraction of the discrepancy could be attributed to intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), by comparing the overlap in clonal and subclonal somatic variants. We first compared variants between an FF and an FFPE sample from a metastatic prostate tumor, showing that on average 50% of the calls in the FF are recovered in the FFPE sample, with notable differences between callers. Combining the variants of the different callers using a simple heuristic, increases both the precision and the sensitivity of the variant calling. Validating the heuristic on nine additional matched FF-FFPE samples, resulted in an average F1-score of 0.58 and an outperformance of any of the individual callers. In addition, we could show that part of the discrepancy between the FF and the FFPE samples can be attributed to ITH. This study illustrates that when using the correct variant calling strategy, the majority of clonal SNVs can be recovered in an FFPE sample with high precision and sensitivity. These results suggest that somatic variants derived from WGS of FFPE material can be used in cohort studies.",BMC Medical Genomics,journal,['JournalArticle'],e81d1e0a-38f9-4519-8a43-f5eb2a934efc,BMC Medical Genomics,,13,N/A,2020,2020-01-16 00:00:00,13,37,"Louise de Schaetzen van Brienen, M.

However, standard variant calling approaches require a matched normal sample from the same individual, which is often not available in the retrospective setting, making it difficult to distinguish between true somatic variants and individual-specific germline variants. Archival sections often contain adjacent normal tissue, but this tissue can include infiltrating tumor cells. As existing comparative somatic variant callers are designed to exclude variants present in the normal sample, a novel approach is required to leverage adjacent normal tissue with infiltrating tumor cells for somatic variant calling. Here we present lumosVar 2.0, a software package designed to jointly analyze multiple samples from the same patient, built upon our previous single sample tumor only variant caller lumosVar 1.0. The approach assumes that the allelic fraction of somatic variants and germline variants follow different patterns as tumor content and copy number state change. lumosVar 2.0 estimates allele specific copy number and tumor sample fractions from the data, and uses a to model to determine expected allelic fractions for somatic and germline variants and to classify variants accordingly. To evaluate the utility of lumosVar 2.0 to jointly call somatic variants with tumor and adjacent normal samples, we used a glioblastoma dataset with matched high and low tumor content and germline whole exome sequencing data (for true somatic variants) available for each patient. Both sensitivity and positive predictive value were improved when analyzing the high tumor and low tumor samples jointly compared to analyzing the samples individually or in-silico pooling of the two samples. Finally, we applied this approach to a set of breast and prostate archival tumor samples for which tumor blocks containing adjacent normal tissue were available for sequencing. Joint analysis using lumosVar 2.0 detected several variants, including known cancer hotspot mutations that were not detected by standard somatic variant calling tools using the adjacent tissue as presumed normal reference. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of leveraging paired tissue samples to improve somatic variant calling when a constitutional sample is not available.",Frontiers in Oncology,journal,['JournalArticle'],fdeb07d1-a046-4a1a-98aa-167e7f8e667a,Frontiers in Oncology,,9,N/A,2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,14,32,"Rebecca F.

One important consideration in repurposing FFPE material for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis is the sequencing artifacts that can arise from the significant damage to nucleic acids due to treatment with formalin, storage at room temperature and extraction. One such class of artifacts consists of chimeric reads that appear to be derived from non-contiguous portions of the genome. Here, we show that a major proportion of such chimeric reads align to both the ‘Watson’ and ‘Crick’ strands of the reference genome. We refer to these as strand-split artifact reads (SSARs). This study provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic basis of the genesis of SSARs and other chimeric artifacts along with supporting experimental evidence, which have led to approaches to reduce the levels of such artifacts. We demonstrate that one of these approaches, involving S1 nuclease-mediated removal of single-stranded fragments and overhangs, also reduces sequence bias, base error rates, and false positive detection of copy number and single nucleotide variants. Finally, we describe an analytical approach for quantifying SSARs from NGS data.",Nucleic Acids Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],da96c220-cd39-4894-bae6-d2d77c8e7aa9,Nucleic Acids Research,e12 - e12,47,N/A,2018,2018-11-12 00:00:00,58,18,"S.

These genes have the greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have diverse molecular functions that include the formation, structure, and function of the synapse. The associations of NMDA receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for the dysfunction of the glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We find significant evidence for an overlap of rare variant risk between schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and severe neurodevelopmental disorders (DD/ID), supporting a neurodevelopmental etiology for schizophrenia. We show that protein-truncating variants in GRIN2A, TRIO, and CACNA1G confer risk for schizophrenia whereas specific missense mutations in these genes confer risk for DD/ID. Nevertheless, few of the strongly associated schizophrenia genes appear to confer risk for DD/ID. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare variant risk, suggesting that common and rare genetic risk factors at least partially converge on the same underlying pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry a substantial excess of URVs, implying that more schizophrenia risk genes await discovery using this approach.",medRxiv,journal,,d5e5b5e7-54b1-4f53-82fc-4853f3e71c58,medRxiv,,,N/A,2020,2020-09-18 00:00:00,108,80,"T.

In this study, we conducted a TWAS using gene expression data from GTEx and summary statistics from the hitherto largest GWAS meta-analysis conducted for breast cancer overall, and by estrogen receptor subtypes (ER+ and ER−). We further compared associations with ER+ and ER− subtypes, using a case-only TWAS approach. We also conducted multigene conditional analyses in regions with multiple TWAS associations. Two genes, STXBP4 and HIST2H2BA, were specifically associated with ER+ but not with ER− breast cancer. We further identified 30 TWAS-significant genes associated with overall breast cancer risk, including four that were not identified in previous studies. Conditional analyses identified single independent breast-cancer gene in three of six regions harboring multiple TWAS-significant genes. Our study provides new information on breast cancer genetics and biology, particularly about genomic differences between ER+ and ER− breast cancer.",Genetic Epidemiology,journal,,0bebd3b7-9bc2-4d76-9916-59f72f7a4d30,Genetic epidemiology,442 - 468,44,N/A,2020,2020-03-01 00:00:00,36,67,"Helian Feng, Alexander Gusev, B.

Existing methods for detecting repeat expansions in short-read sequencing data require predefined repeat catalogs. Recent discoveries emphasize the need for methods that do not require pre-specified candidate repeats. To address this need, we introduce ExpansionHunter Denovo, an efficient catalog-free method for genome-wide repeat expansion detection.

The current availability of hundreds of GWASs provides a unique opportunity to address these questions. We systematically analyzed 4,155 publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWASs on 558 traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and genetic architecture. We show that trait-associated loci cover more than half of the genome, and 90% of these overlap with loci from multiple traits. We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits. Our results provide insights into how genetic variation contributes to trait variation. All GWAS results can be queried and visualized at the GWAS ATLAS resource (https://atlas.ctglab.nl).

At the same time, the tremendous growth in the popularity and usage of social media, such as Twitter, has resulted on an immense increase in user-generated data, as mainly represented by the corresponding texts in users’ posts. However, the analysis of these specific data and the extraction of actionable knowledge and added value out of them is a challenging task due to the domain diversity and the high multilingualism that characterizes these data. The latter highlights the emerging need for the implementation and utilization of domain-agnostic and multilingual solutions. To investigate a portion of these challenges this research work performs a comparative analysis of multilingual approaches for classifying both the sentiment and the text of an examined multilingual corpus. In this context, four multilingual BERT-based classifiers and a zero-shot classification approach are utilized and compared in terms of their accuracy and applicability in the classification of multilingual data. Their comparison has unveiled insightful outcomes and has a twofold interpretation. Multilingual BERT-based classifiers achieve high performances and transfer inference when trained and fine-tuned on multilingual data. While also the zero-shot approach presents a novel technique for creating multilingual solutions in a faster, more efficient, and scalable way. It can easily be fitted to new languages and new tasks while achieving relatively good results across many languages. However, when efficiency and scalability are less important than accuracy, it seems that this model, and zero-shot models in general, can not be compared to fine-tuned and trained multilingual BERT-based classifiers.",Neural computing & applications (Print),Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Neural Computing & Applications,1 - 17,,Unknown,2023,2023-05-08 00:00:00,33,60,"George Manias, Argyro Mavrogiorgou, Athanasios Kiourtis, Chrysostomos Symvoulidis, D.

Habitat mapping relies on seafloor classification typically based on acoustic methods, and ground truthing through direct sampling and optical imaging. With the increasing capabilities to record high-resolution underwater images, manual approaches for analyzing these images to create seafloor classifications are no longer feasible. Automated workflows have been proposed as a solution, in which algorithms assign pre-defined seafloor categories to each image. However, in order to provide consistent and repeatable analysis, these automated workflows need to address e.g., underwater illumination artefacts, variances in resolution and class-imbalances, which could bias the classification. Here, we present a generic implementation of an Automated and Integrated Seafloor Classification Workflow (AI-SCW). The workflow aims to classify the seafloor into habitat categories based on automated analysis of optical underwater images with only minimal amount of human annotations. AI-SCW incorporates laser point detection for scale determination and color normalization. It further includes semi-automatic generation of the training data set for fitting the seafloor classifier. As a case study, we applied the workflow to an example seafloor image dataset from the Belgian and German contract areas for Manganese-nodule exploration in the Pacific Ocean. Based on this, we provide seafloor classifications along the camera deployment tracks, and discuss results in the context of seafloor multibeam bathymetry. Our results show that the seafloor in the Belgian area predominantly comprises densely distributed nodules, which are intermingled with qualitatively larger-sized nodules at local elevations and within depressions. On the other hand, the German area primarily comprises nodules that only partly cover the seabed, and these occur alongside turned-over sediment (artificial seafloor) that were caused by the settling plume following a dredging experiment conducted in the area.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,N/A,2022,2022-09-12 00:00:00,6,83,"Benson Mbani, T.

Volume and velocity are further increased by growing fleets and emerging swarms of autonomous vehicles creating big data sets in parallel. This generates a need for automated data processing to harvest maximum information. Systematic data analysis benefits from calibrated, geo-referenced data with clear metadata description, particularly for machine vision and machine learning. Hence, the expensive data acquisition must be documented, data should be curated as soon as possible, backed up and made publicly available.

In this study, high-resolution bathymetric multibeam and optical image data,
both obtained within the Belgian manganese (Mn) nodule mining license area by
the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Abyss, were combined in
order to create a predictive random
forests (RF) machine learning model. AUV bathymetry reveals small-scale
terrain variations, allowing slope estimations and calculation of bathymetric
derivatives such as slope, curvature, and ruggedness. Optical AUV imagery
provides quantitative information regarding the distribution (number and
median size) of Mn nodules. Within the area considered in this study, Mn
nodules show a heterogeneous and spatially clustered pattern, and their
number per square meter is negatively correlated with their median size. A
prediction of the number of Mn nodules was achieved by combining information
derived from the acoustic and optical data using a RF model. This model was
tuned by examining the influence of the training set size, the number of
growing trees (ntree), and the number of predictor variables to be
randomly selected at each node (mtry) on the RF prediction accuracy. The use of larger training
data sets with higher ntree and mtry values increases the
accuracy. To estimate the Mn-nodule abundance, these predictions were linked
to ground-truth data acquired by box coring. Linking optical and
hydroacoustic data revealed a nonlinear relationship between the Mn-nodule
distribution and topographic characteristics. This highlights the importance
of a detailed terrain reconstruction for a predictive modeling of Mn-nodule
abundance. In addition, this study underlines the necessity of a sufficient
spatial distribution of the optical data to provide reliable modeling input
for the RF.

data from the German ferromanganese-nodule (Mn-nodule) license area in the
Clarion–Clipperton Zone (CCZ; eastern Pacific) are linked to ground-truth
data from optical imaging. Photographs obtained by an AUV enable
semi-quantitative assessments of nodule coverage at a spatial resolution in
the range of meters. Together with high-resolution AUV bathymetry, this
revealed a correlation of small-scale terrain variations (  5  m 
horizontally,  1  m vertically) with nodule coverage. In the
presented data set, increased nodule coverage could be correlated with slopes
 >  1.8 ∘ and concave terrain. On a more regional scale, factors such
as the geological setting (existence of horst and graben structures, sediment
thickness, outcropping basement) and influence of bottom currents seem to
play an essential role for the spatial variation of nodule coverage and the
related hard substrate habitat. AUV imagery was also successfully employed to map the distribution
of resettled sediment following a disturbance and sediment cloud
generation during a sampling deployment of an epibenthic
sledge. Data from before and after the “disturbance” allow
a direct assessment of the impact. Automated image processing
analyzed the nodule coverage at the seafloor, revealing nodule
blanketing by resettling of suspended sediment within 16 h after
the disturbance. The visually detectable impact was spatially
limited to a maximum of 100  m distance from the disturbance
track, downstream of the bottom water current. A correlation with
high-resolution AUV bathymetry reveals that the blanketing pattern
varies in extent by tens of meters, strictly following the
bathymetry, even in areas of only slightly undulating seafloor
( 1  m vertical change). These results highlight the importance of detailed terrain knowledge
when engaging in resource assessment studies for nodule abundance
estimates and defining mineable areas. At the same time, it shows
the importance of high-resolution mapping for detailed benthic
habitat studies that show a heterogeneity at scales of 10 to
100  m . Terrain knowledge is also needed to determine the
scale of the impact by seafloor sediment blanketing during mining
operations.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Biogeosciences,2525-2549,15,Unknown,2018,2018-04-27 00:00:00,71,77,"Anne Peukert, T. Schoening, Evangelos Alevizos, K. Köser, T. Kwasnitschka, J.

Nevertheless, the complexity and non-linear behaviour associated with such kind of energy systems hinder the development of accurate algorithms. In such a context, this paper investigates the use of a state-of-art deep learning architecture in order to perform precise load demand forecasting 24-h-ahead in the whole country of France using RTE data. To this end, the authors propose an encoder-decoder architecture inspired by WaveNet, a deep generative model initially designed by Google DeepMind for raw audio waveforms. WaveNet uses dilated causal convolutions and skip-connection to utilise long-term information. This kind of novel ML architecture presents different advantages regarding other statistical algorithms. On the one hand, the proposed deep learning model’s training process can be parallelized in GPUs, which is an advantage in terms of training times compared to recurrent networks. On the other hand, the model prevents degradations problems (explosions and vanishing gradients) due to the residual connections. In addition, this model can learn from an input sequence to produce a forecast sequence in a one-shot manner. For comparison purposes, a comparative analysis between the most performing state-of-art deep learning models and traditional statistical approaches is presented: Autoregressive-Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-Short-Term-Memory, Gated-Recurrent-Unit (GRU), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), causal 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) and ConvLSTM (Encoder-Decoder).

To solve the limitation of the existing load forecasting methods in dealing with time-series data, causing the poor stability and non-ideal forecasting accuracy, this paper proposed an attention-based encoder-decoder network with Bayesian optimization to do the accurate short-term power load forecasting. Proposed model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with a gated recurrent units (GRU) recurrent neural network with high robustness on time-series data modeling. The temporal attention layer focuses on the key features of input data that play a vital role in promoting the prediction accuracy for load forecasting. Finally, the Bayesian optimization method is used to confirm the model’s hyperparameters to achieve optimal predictions.

Moreover, a push for electrical vehicle and other economic developments are expected to further increase energy use. To combat these challenges, electrical load forecasting is essential as it supports energy production planning and scheduling, assists with budgeting, and helps identify saving opportunities. Machine learning approaches commonly used for energy forecasting such as feedforward neural networks and support vector regression encounter challenges with capturing time dependencies. Consequently, this paper proposes Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Network (S2S RNN) with Attention for electrical load forecasting. The S2S architecture from language translation is adapted for load forecasting and a corresponding sample generation approach is designed. RNN enables capturing time dependencies present in the load data and S2S model further improves time modeling by combining two RNNs: encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism alleviates the burden of connecting encoder and decoder.

Since high levels of uncertainties exist in the load time series, it is a challenging task to make accurate short-term load forecast (STLF). In recent years, deep learning approaches provide better performance to predict electrical load in real world cases. The convolutional neural network (CNN) can extract the local trend and capture the same pattern, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed to learn the relationship in time steps. In this paper, a new deep neural network framework that integrates the hidden feature of the CNN model and the LSTM model is proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy. The proposed model was tested in a real-world case, and detailed experiments were conducted to validate its practicality and stability. The forecasting performance of the proposed model was compared with the LSTM model and the CNN model. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used as the evaluation indexes.

Consequently, this implies a substantial increase in the amount of personal data collected, transported, processed, and stored. The authors of this paper designed and implemented an integrated personal health data management system, which considers data-driven software and hardware sensors, comprehensive data privacy techniques, and machine-learning-based algorithmic models. It was determined that there are very few relevant and complete surveys concerning this specific problem. Therefore, the current scientific research was considered, and this paper comprehensively analyzes the importance of deep learning techniques that are applied to the overall management of data collected by data-driven soft sensors. This survey considers aspects that are related to demographics, health and body parameters, and human activity and behaviour pattern detection. Additionally, the relatively complex problem of designing and implementing data privacy mechanisms, while ensuring efficient data access, is also discussed, and the relevant metrics are presented.

A fundamental yet understudied problem in this area is finding an optimal data representation for processing athlete trajectories using machine learning algorithms. In the present work, we address this gap by discussing common representations in use and propose Tactical Graphs , an alternative graph-based format capable of producing integrative, contextualized models for machine learning applications. We provide an in-depth, domain-specific motivation of the proposed data representation scheme and show how this approach exploits inherent data traits. We propose Tactical Graph Networks (TGNets), a light-weight, hybrid machine learning architecture sensitive to player interactions. Our method is evaluated with an extensive ablation study and the first comprehensive state of the art comparison between standard feature, state vector, and image-based methods on the same dataset. Experiments were conducted using real-world football data containing short sequences of defensive play labelled according to the outcome of ball winning attempts. The results indicate that TGNets are on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models while exhibiting only a fraction of their complexity. We further demonstrate that selecting the right data representation is crucial as it has a significant influence on model performance.

Similarly, remote monitoring and assessment of athletes in sports training seem to be barriers to physical education monitoring and training. It creates various chances to improve training and education through technology advancements like IoT and deep learning. Students can efficiently monitor their physical behavior to increase their physical and psychological benefits.

The management ability allows students to organize and increase speed their physical activity in a wellness manner.

The study explored the use of the random forest regression (RFR), a supervised machine learning (ML) model, as an alternative to the physically based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for predicting streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters near Del Norte, a snowmelt-dominated mountainous watershed of the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Remotely sensed data were used for the random forest machine learning analysis (RFML) and RStudio for data processing and synthesizing. The RFML model outperformed the SWAT model in accuracy and demonstrated its capability in predicting streamflow in this region. We implemented a customized approach to the RFR model to assess the model’s performance for three training periods, across 1991–2010, 1996–2010, and 2001–2010; the results indicated that the model’s accuracy improved with longer training periods, implying that the model trained on a more extended period is better able to capture the parameters’ variability and reproduce streamflow data more accurately. The variable importance (i.e., IncNodePurity) measure of the RFML model revealed that the snow depth and the minimum temperature were consistently the top two predictors across all training periods. The paper also evaluated how well the SWAT model performs in reproducing streamflow data of the watershed with a conventional approach. The SWAT model needed more time and data to set up and calibrate, delivering acceptable performance in annual mean streamflow simulation, with satisfactory index of agreement (d), coefficient of determination (R2), and percent bias (PBIAS) values, but monthly simulation warrants further exploration and model adjustments. The study recommends exploring snowmelt runoff hydrologic processes, dust-driven sublimation effects, and more detailed topographic input parameters to update the SWAT snowmelt routine for better monthly flow estimation. The results provide a critical analysis for enhancing streamflow prediction, which is valuable for further research and water resource management, including snowmelt-driven semi-arid regions.",Remote Sensing,journal,['JournalArticle'],8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

In this paper, a multi-scale-variables-driven streamflow forecasting (MVDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy and provide more information for decision-making. This framework was realized by integrating random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with multi-scale variables (hydrometeorological and climate predictors) as inputs and is referred to as RF-GPR-MV. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the RF-GPR-MV model, it was implemented for multi-step-ahead monthly streamflow forecasts with horizons of 1 to 12 months for two key hydrological stations in the Jinsha River basin, Southwest China. Other MVDSF models based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and GPR with/without multi-scale variables or the PCC and a backpropagation neural network (BP) or general regression neural network (GRNN), with only previous streamflow and precipitation, namely, PCC-GPR-MV, PCC-GPR-QP, PCC-BP-QP, and PCC-GRNN-QP, respectively, were selected as benchmarks. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model was superior to the other benchmark models in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for almost all forecasting scenarios, especially for forecasting with longer lead times. Additionally, the results also confirmed that the addition of large-scale climate and circulation factors was beneficial for promoting the streamflow forecasting ability, with an average contribution rate of about 15%. The RF in the MVDSF framework improved the forecasting performance, with an average contribution rate of about 25%. This improvement was more pronounced when the lead time exceeded 3 months. Moreover, the proposed model could also provide prediction intervals (PIs) to characterize forecast uncertainty, as supplementary information to further help decision makers in relevant departments to avoid risks in water resources management.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,,,N/A,2022,2022-06-06 00:00:00,22,56,"Na Sun, Shuai Zhang, Tian Peng, N.

Due to this, the study of SF prediction is highly significant for the purpose of municipal and environmental damage mitigation. In the present study, machine learning (ML) models based on the support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are tested and developed to predict SF for 11 different rivers throughout Peninsular Malaysia. SF data sets for the rivers were collected from the Malaysian Department of Irrigation and Drainage. The main objective of the present study is to propose a universal model that is most capable of predicting SFs for rivers within Peninsular Malaysia. Based on the findings, the ANN3 model which was developed using the ANN algorithm and input scenario 3 (inputs consisting of previous 3 days SF) is deduced as the best overall ML model for SF prediction as it outperformed all the other models in 4 out of 11 of the tested data sets; and obtained among the highest average RMs with a score of 3.27, hence indicating that the model is very adaptable and reliable in accurately predicting SF based on different data sets and river case studies. Therefore, the ANN3 model is proposed as a universal model for SF prediction within Peninsular Malaysia.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,N/A,2022,2022-03-10 00:00:00,42,63,"Yusuf Essam, Yuk Feng Huang, J.

Herein OCE was applied to evaluate previously inaccessible biomechanical characteristics of human corneal tissue and to study the role of Bowman's layer in corneal biomechanics. Methods Human corneal donor buttons (n = 23) were obtained and Descemet's membrane and endothelium were removed. In 11 corneas, Bowman's layer was ablated by a 20 µm stromal excimer laser ablation. Buttons were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber and subjected to a pressure modulation from 10 to 30 mm Hg, and back to 10 mm Hg, in steps of 1 mm Hg. At each step, a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scan was obtained. Displacements were analyzed by optical flow tracking, and strain over the entire stromal depth was retrieved from the phase gradient of the complex interference signal. Results During pressure increase, corneal tissue moved upward (486–585 nm/mm Hg) but did not fully recover (Δ= 2.63 to 8.64 µm) after pressure decrease. Vertical corneal strain distribution was negative in the anterior and positive in the posterior cornea, indicating simultaneous corneal compression and expansion, respectively. Bowman's layer caused minor localized differences in corneal strain distribution. Conclusions Corneal strain distribution is more complex than previously assumed, with a fundamental difference in mechanical response between the anterior and posterior stroma. Clinically, OCE technology might be used to monitor the progression of corneal ectatic diseases and to determine the success of corneal cross-linking.",Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],e52aeb8d-b929-43a2-b584-f0f5fbcfd9f4,Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science,,61,N/A,2020,2020-06-01 00:00:00,24,34,"S.

Risk prediction of hypertension is an intervention that contributes to the early prevention and management of hypertension. The implementation of such intervention requires an effective and easy-to-implement hypertension risk prediction model. This study evaluated and compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms on predicting the risk of hypertension based on easy-to-collect risk factors. A dataset of 29,700 samples collected through a physical examination was used for model training and testing. Firstly, we identified easy-to-collect risk factors of hypertension, through univariate logistic regression analysis. Then, based on the selected features, 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to optimize four models, random forest (RF), CatBoost, MLP neural network and logistic regression (LR), to find the best hyper-parameters on the training set. Finally, the performance of models was evaluated by AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on the test set. The experimental results showed that the RF model outperformed the other three models, and achieved an AUC of 0.92, an accuracy of 0.82, a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.81. In addition, Body Mass Index (BMI), age, family history and waist circumference (WC) are the four primary risk factors of hypertension. These findings reveal that it is feasible to use machine learning algorithms, especially RF, to predict hypertension risk without clinical or genetic data. The technique can provide a non-invasive and economical way for the prevention and management of hypertension in a large population.",Frontiers in Public Health,journal,['JournalArticle'],d3dd5449-daa1-4d57-9412-9add6037584f,Frontiers in Public Health,,9,N/A,2021,2021-09-24 00:00:00,32,56,"Huanhuan Zhao, Xiaoyu Zhang, Yang Xu, Lisheng Gao, Zuchang Ma, Yining Sun, Weimin Wang","47940978, 2115797509, 2115681606, 1804676886, 2915371, 2548973, 2144318755",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e24c87ea6ebb4a8ff106e1e173708f2f807398c1,"Computer Science, Medicine",47940978

Prediction and early diagnosis is important to prevent related health complications. The objective is to construct and compare predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using 987 records of Qataris and long-term residents aged 18+ years from Qatar Biobank. Percentages were used to summarize data and chi-square tests to assess associations. Predictive models of hypertension were constructed and compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of algorithms was assessed using accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Stata and Weka were used for analysis. Results Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother’s history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. All algorithms showed more or less similar performances: Random forest (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.4%, sensitivity = 82.1%), logistic regression (accuracy = 81.1%, PPV = 80.1%, sensitivity = 81.1%) and decision tree (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.2%, sensitivity = 82.1%. In terms of AUC, compared to logistic regression, while random forest performed similarly, decision tree had a significantly lower discrimination ability (p-value<0.05) with AUC’s equal to 85.0, 86.9, and 79.9, respectively. Conclusions Machine learning provides the chance of having a rapid predictive model using non-invasive predictors to screen for hypertension. Future research should consider improving the predictive accuracy of models in larger general populations, including more important predictors and using a variety of algorithms.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,15,N/A,2020,2020-10-16 00:00:00,56,67,"Latifa A AlKaabi, Lina S Ahmed, Maryam F Al Attiyah, M.

Chapter 12 concludes the book with some commentary about the scienti c contributions of MTS. The Taguchi method for design of experiment has generated considerable controversy in the statistical community over the past few decades. The MTS/MTGS method seems to lead another source of discussions on the methodology it advocates (Montgomery 2003). As pointed out by Woodall et al. (2003), the MTS/MTGS methods are considered ad hoc in the sense that they have not been developed using any underlying statistical theory. Because the “normal” and “abnormal” groups form the basis of the theory, some sampling restrictions are fundamental to the applications. First, it is essential that the “normal” sample be uniform, unbiased, and/or complete so that a reliable measurement scale is obtained. Second, the selection of “abnormal” samples is crucial to the success of dimensionality reduction when OAs are used. For example, if each abnormal item is really unique in the medical example, then it is unclear how the statistical distance MD can be guaranteed to give a consistent diagnosis measure of severity on a continuous scale when the larger-the-better type S/N ratio is used. Multivariate diagnosis is not new to Technometrics readers and is now becoming increasingly more popular in statistical analysis and data mining for knowledge discovery. As a promising alternative that assumes no underlying data model, The Mahalanobis–Taguchi Strategy does not provide suf cient evidence of gains achieved by using the proposed method over existing tools. Readers may be very interested in a detailed comparison with other diagnostic tools, such as logistic regression and tree-based methods. Overall, although the idea of MTS/MTGS is intriguing, this book would be more valuable had it been written in a rigorous fashion as a technical reference. There is some lack of precision even in several mathematical notations. Perhaps a follow-up with additional theoretical justi cation and careful case studies would answer some of the lingering questions.",Technometrics,journal,['JournalArticle'],ca4b3aef-bda7-47fe-b7e5-4f9cd6cb1947,Technometrics,267 - 268,45,N/A,2003,2003-08-01 00:00:00,17837,7,E.

The functions of RNAs are strongly coupled to their structures or proper structure changes, and RNA structure prediction has been paid much attention in the last two decades.

Here, we report assessments of RNA structure predictions in CASP15, the first CASP exercise that involved RNA structure modeling. Forty two predictor groups submitted models for at least one of twelve RNA-containing targets. These models were evaluated by the RNA-Puzzles organizers and, separately, by a CASP-recruited team using metrics (GDT, lDDT) and approaches (Z-score rankings) initially developed for assessment of proteins and generalized here for RNA assessment. The two assessments independently ranked the same predictor groups as first (AIchemy_RNA2), second (Chen), and third (RNAPolis and GeneSilico, tied); predictions from deep learning approaches were significantly worse than these top ranked groups, which did not use deep learning. Further analyses based on direct comparison of predicted models to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps and X-ray diffraction data support these rankings. With the exception of two RNA-protein complexes, models submitted by CASP15 groups correctly predicted the global fold of the RNA targets. Comparisons of CASP15 submissions to designed RNA nanostructures as well as molecular replacement trials highlight the potential utility of current RNA modeling approaches for RNA nanotechnology and structural biology, respectively.

However, accurate modeling of 3D RNA structure remains a challenging problem. Here we present a novel method, DRfold, to predict RNA tertiary structures by simultaneous learning of local frame rotations and geometric restraints from experimentally solved RNA structures, where the learned knowledge is converted into a hybrid energy potential to guide subsequent RNA structure constructions. The method significantly outperforms previous approaches by >75.6% in TM-score on a nonredundant dataset containing recently released structures. Detailed analyses showed that the major contribution to the improvements arise from the deep end-to-end learning supervised with the atom coordinates and the composite energy function integrating complementary information from geometry restraints and end-to-end learning models.

Inspired by the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction, we developed trRosettaRNA, a novel deep learning-based approach to de novo prediction of RNA 3D structure. Like trRosetta, the trRosettaRNA pipeline comprises two major steps: 1D and 2D geometries prediction by a transformer network; and full-atom 3D structure folding by energy minimization with constraints from the predicted geometries. We benchmarked trRosettaRNA on two independent datasets. The results show that trRosettaRNA outperforms other conventional methods by a large margin. For example, on 25 targets from the RNA-Puzzles experiments, the mean RMSD of the models predicted by trRosettaRNA is 5.5 Å, compared with 10.5 Å from the state-of-the-art human group (i.e., Das). Further comparisons with two recently released deep learning-based methods (i.e., DeepFoldRNA and RoseTTAFoldNA) show that all three methods have similar accuracy. However, trRosettaRNA yields more accurate and physically more realistic side-chain atoms than DeepFoldRNA and RoseTTAFoldNA. Finally, we apply trRosettaRNA to predict the structures for the Rfam families that do not have known structures. Analysis shows that for 263 families, the predicted structure models are estimated to be accurate with RMSD < 4 Å.

This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes Explainable AI (XAI) to improve the interpretability of predictive healthcare models. The proposed system integrates feature importance-based methodologies with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to offer a comprehensive comprehension of the predictive and preventive healthcare recommendations. The framework commences by conducting an in-depth examination of the present condition of Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare sector, as well as the importance of predictive and preventive healthcare. The literature review examines the difficulties related to the comprehensibility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare field and presents feature importance-based approaches and LIME as potential remedies. The focus is on the hybrid approach that combines these techniques, as it has the potential to offer precise predictions while also ensuring a strong level of interpretability. The methodology section delineates the procedure for gathering healthcare data and IoT sensor data, subsequently followed by preprocessing measures such as data cleansing and feature engineering. The predictive models undergo a process of selection, training, and evaluation, with the primary objective of attaining a notable accuracy level of 0.961. This text provides a detailed explanation of how the combination of feature importance-based approaches and LIME improves the transparency and interpretability of the model. An extensive case study is provided to illustrate the implementation of the suggested framework in an actual situation. The results and evaluation section showcases the exceptional precision of 0.961, as well as enhanced interpretability scores and decreased computational time in comparison to the baseline XAI models. The discussion section juxtaposes the suggested hybrid approach with conventional models, examines ethical considerations, and investigates the scalability and generalizability of the framework.

In particular, the TinyML framework in such devices aims to deliver reduced latency, efficient bandwidth consumption, improved data security, increased privacy, lower costs and overall network cost reduction in cloud environments. Its ability to enable IoT devices to work effectively without constant connectivity to cloud services, while nevertheless providing accurate ML services, offers a viable alternative for IoT applications seeking cost-effective solutions. TinyML intends to deliver on-premises analytics that bring significant value to IoT services, particularly in environments with limited connection. This review article defines TinyML, presents an overview of its benefits and uses and provides background information based on up-to-date literature. Then, we demonstrate the TensorFlow Lite framework which supports TinyML along with analytical steps for an ML model creation. In addition, we explore the integration of TinyML with network technologies such as 5G and LPWAN. Ultimately, we anticipate that this analysis will serve as an informational pillar for the IoT/Cloud research community and pave the way for future studies.",Future Internet,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",c3e5f1c8-9ba7-47e5-acde-53063a69d483,Future Internet,363,14,N/A,2022,2022-12-06 00:00:00,79,64,"N.

Visual data in such cameras are usually captured in analog voltages by a sensor pixel array, and then converted to the digital domain for subsequent AI processing using analog-to-digital converters (ADC). Recent research has tried to take advantage of massively parallel low-power analog/digital computing in the form of near- and in-sensor processing, in which the AI computation is performed partly in the periphery of the pixel array and partly in a separate on-board CPU/accelerator. Unfortunately, high-resolution input images still need to be streamed between the camera and the AI processing unit, frame by frame, causing energy, bandwidth, and security bottlenecks. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel Processing-in-Pixel-in-memory (P2M) paradigm, that customizes the pixel array by adding support for analog multi-channel, multi-bit convolution, batch normalization, and Rectified Linear Units (ReLU). Our solution includes a holistic algorithm-circuit co-design approach and the resulting P2M paradigm can be used as a drop-in replacement for embedding memory-intensive first few layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) models within foundry-manufacturable CMOS image sensor platforms. Our experimental results indicate that P2M reduces data transfer bandwidth from sensors and analog to digital conversions by ∼21×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\sim }\,21\times$$\end{document}, and the energy-delay product (EDP) incurred in processing a MobileNetV2 model on a TinyML use case for visual wake words dataset (VWW) by up to ∼11×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathord {\sim }\,11\times$$\end{document} compared to standard near-processing or in-sensor implementations, without any significant drop in test accuracy.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,N/A,2022,2022-03-07 00:00:00,36,62,"G.

Aiming at the difficulty in fault characteristics extraction and fault modes classification of the three-phase full-bridge inverter (TFI) that used as the drive module of brushless DC motor (BLDCM). A hybrid convolutional neural network (HCNN) model consists of one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) and two-dimensional CNN (2D-CNN) is proposed in this paper, which can tap more effective spatial feature for TFI fault diagnosis. The frequency spectrum from the three-phase current signal preprocess are applied as the input for 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN to conduct feature extraction, respectively. Then, the feature layers information are combined in the fully connected layer of HCNN. Finally, the performance status of TFI could be identified by the softmax classifier with Adam optimizer. Several groups of experiments have been studied when the BLDCM under different operating conditions. The results show that the fusion features can get a higher degree of discrimination so as to the presented network model also obtains better classification accuracy, which verify the feasibility and superiority to the other networks.",Complex & Intelligent Systems,journal,,d30c9917-b233-46f4-a644-8e5cdf6d6c5e,Complex & Intelligent Systems,29 - 42,8,N/A,2021,2021-04-03 00:00:00,36,48,"Quan Sun, Xianghai Yu, Hongsheng Li, JiSheng Fan","2109272295, 102908609, 2108509846, 2041290857",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d0bec7a00bb589f183ac306da39345d6f363e31,"Computer Science, Engineering",2109272295

New wearable devices may help people to automatically record energy assumed in their meals. Objective: The present review collects the released articles about wearable devices or method for automatic caloric assessments. Method: A literature research has been performed with PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and ClinicalTrials.gov search engines, considering released articles regarding applications of wearable devices in eating environment, from 2005 onwards. Results: Several tools allow caloric assessment and food registration: wearable devices counting the number of bites ingested by the user, instruments detecting swallows and chewings, methods that analyse food with digital photography. All of them still require more validation and improvement. Conclusion: Automatic recording of caloric intake through wearable devices is a promising method to monitor body weight and eating habits in clinical and non-clinical settings, and the research is still going on.",Open Nursing Journal,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",48e77024-dd63-46b3-b7e6-b3019483f2f8,The Open Nursing Journal,232 - 240,11,N/A,2017,2017-10-31 00:00:00,9,21,"Maria Laura Magrini, Clara Minto, Francesca Lazzarini, M.

Objective The objective of this study was to develop a new method, based on an app for mobile phones called e-EPIDEMIOLOGY, which was designed to collect individual consumption data for a series of foods/drinks, and to compare this app with a previously validated paper food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Methods University students >18 years of age recorded the consumption of certain foods/drinks using e-EPIDEMIOLOGY during 28 consecutive days and then filled out a paper FFQ at the end of the study period. To evaluate the agreement between the categories of habitual consumption for each of the foods/drinks included in the study, cross-classification analysis and a weighted kappa statistic were used. Results A total of 119 participants completed the study (71% female, 85/119; 29% male, 34/119). Cross-classification analysis showed that 79.8% of the participants were correctly classified into the same category and just 1.1% were misclassified into opposite categories. The average weighted kappa statistic was good (κ=.64). Conclusions The results indicate that e-EPIDEMIOLOGY generated ranks of dietary intakes that were highly comparable with the previously validated paper FFQ. However, it was noted that further testing of e-EPIDEMIOLOGY is required to establish its wider utility.",JMIR Research Protocols,journal,['JournalArticle'],278131df-030d-4e6c-b083-d57f3b740dc4,JMIR Research Protocols,,5,N/A,2016,2016-11-02 00:00:00,20,52,"L.

If successful, these lifestyle apps may have far-reaching effects for disease prevention and health cost-savings, but few researchers have analyzed data from these apps. Objective The purposes of this study were to analyze data from a commercial health app (Lose It!) in order to identify successful weight loss subgroups via exploratory analyses and to verify the stability of the results. Methods Cross-sectional, de-identified data from Lose It! were analyzed. This dataset (n=12,427,196) was randomly split into 24 subsamples, and this study used 3 subsamples (combined n=972,687). Classification and regression tree methods were used to explore groupings of weight loss with one subsample, with descriptive analyses to examine other group characteristics. Data mining validation methods were conducted with 2 additional subsamples. Results In subsample 1, 14.96% of users lost 5% or more of their starting body weight. Classification and regression tree analysis identified 3 distinct subgroups: “the occasional users” had the lowest proportion (4.87%) of individuals who successfully lost weight; “the basic users” had 37.61% weight loss success; and “the power users” achieved the highest percentage of weight loss success at 72.70%. Behavioral factors delineated the subgroups, though app-related behavioral characteristics further distinguished them. Results were replicated in further analyses with separate subsamples. Conclusions This study demonstrates that distinct subgroups can be identified in “messy” commercial app data and the identified subgroups can be replicated in independent samples. Behavioral factors and use of custom app features characterized the subgroups. Targeting and tailoring information to particular subgroups could enhance weight loss success. Future studies should replicate data mining analyses to increase methodology rigor.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,journal,['JournalArticle'],2baad992-2268-4c38-9120-e453622f2eeb,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,18,N/A,2016,2016-06-01 00:00:00,55,41,"Katrina J Serrano, Mandi Yu, Kisha I Coa, L.

Using this technology, scientists and physicians can observe the entire human genome comprehensively, generating a plethora of new sequencing data. Modern computational analysis entails advanced algorithms for variant detection, as well as complex models for classification. Data science and machine learning play a crucial role in the processing and interpretation of results, using enormous databases and statistics to discover new and support current genotype–phenotype correlations. In clinical practice, this technology has greatly enabled the development of personalized medicine, approaching each patient individually and in accordance with their genetic and biochemical profile. The most propulsive areas include rare disease genomics, oncogenomics, pharmacogenomics, neonatal screening, and infectious disease genomics. Another crucial application of WGS lies in the field of multi-omics, working towards the complete integration of human biomolecular data. Further technological development of sequencing technologies has led to the birth of third and fourth-generation sequencing, which include long-read sequencing, single-cell genomics, and nanopore sequencing.

The transformation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells with molecular alterations can occur during epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT mechanism accelerates the cancer metastasis and drug resistance ability in human cancers. Among the different regulators of EMT, Wnt/β-catenin axis has been emerged as a versatile modulator. Wnt is in active form in physiological condition due to the function of GSK-3β that destructs β-catenin, while ligand–receptor interaction impairs GSK-3β function to increase β-catenin stability and promote its nuclear transfer. Regarding the oncogenic function of Wnt/β-catenin, its upregulation occurs in human cancers and it can accelerate EMT-mediated metastasis and drug resistance. The stimulation of Wnt by binding Wnt ligands into Frizzled receptors can enhance β-catenin accumulation in cytoplasm that stimulates EMT and related genes upon nuclear translocation. Wnt/β-catenin/EMT axis has been implicated in augmenting metastasis of both solid and hematological tumors. The Wnt/EMT-mediated cancer metastasis promotes the malignant behavior of tumor cells, causing therapy resistance. The Wnt/β-catenin/EMT axis can be modulated by upstream mediators in which non-coding RNAs are main regulators. Moreover, pharmacological intervention, mainly using phytochemicals, suppresses Wnt/EMT axis in metastasis suppression.

These types of attacks represent a serious threat to detection systems in environments having high noise rate or uncertainty, such as complex networks and Internet of Thing (IoT). Recent work in the literature has suggested using the K-nearest neighboring algorithm to defend against such attacks. However, such an approach can suffer from low to miss-classification rate accuracy. In this paper, we design an architecture to tackle the Android malware detection problem in IoT systems. We develop an attack mechanism based on silhouette clustering method, modified for mobile Android platforms. We proposed two convolutional neural network-type deep learning algorithms against this Silhouette Clustering-based Label Flipping Attack. We show the effectiveness of these two defense algorithms—label-based semi-supervised defense and clustering-based semi-supervised defense—in correcting labels being attacked. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by varying the various machine learning parameters on three Android datasets: Drebin, Contagio, and Genome and three types of features: API, intent, and permission. Our evaluation shows that using random forest feature selection and varying ratios of features can result in an improvement of up to 19% accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art method in the literature.",Neural computing & applications (Print),Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Neural Computing and Applications,14781 - 14800,32,Unknown,2019,2019-08-13 00:00:00,86,45,"R.

In addition, bidirectional interactions between the intestinal microbiota and host mitochondria may modulate intestinal inflammation. We observed previously that mice deficient in the mitochondrial protein MCJ (Methylation-controlled J protein) exhibit increased susceptibility to DSS colitis. However, it is unclear whether this phenotype is primarily driven by MCJ^−/− associated gut microbiota dysbiosis or by direct effects of MCJ-deficiency. Here, we demonstrate that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MCJ-deficient into germ-free mice was sufficient to confer increased susceptibility to colitis. Therefore, an FMT experiment by cohousing was designed to alter MCJ-deficient microbiota. The phenotype resulting from complex I deficiency was reverted by FMT. In addition, we determined the protein expression pathways impacted by MCJ deficiency, providing insight into the pathophysiology of IBD. Further, we used magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the intestinal microbiota with Immunoglobulin A (IgA-SEQ) in MCJ-deficient mice. We show that high IgA coating of fecal bacteria observed in MCJ-deficient mice play a potential role in disease progression. This study allowed us to identify potential microbial signatures in feces associated with complex I deficiency and disease progression.

Accumulating evidences have revealed the close relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation and progression of stomach cancer. However, rare prognostic models for mitochondrial-related gene risk have been built up in stomach cancer. Methods In current study, the expression and prognostic value of mitochondrial-related genes in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients were systematically analyzed to establish a mitochondrial-related risk model based on available TCGA and GEO databases. The tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell infiltration, tumor mutation burden, and drug sensitivity of gastric adenocarcinoma patients were also investigated using R language, GraphPad Prism 8 and online databases. Results We established a mitochondrial-related risk prognostic model including NOX4, ALDH3A2, FKBP10 and MAOA and validated its predictive power. This risk model indicated that the immune cell infiltration in high-risk group was significantly different from that in the low-risk group. Besides, the risk score was closely related to TME signature genes and immune checkpoint molecules, suggesting that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment might lead to poor prognosis in high-risk groups. Moreover, TIDE analysis demonstrated that combined analysis of risk score and immune score, or stromal score, or microsatellite status could more effectively predict the benefit of immunotherapy in STAD patients with different stratifications. Finally, rapamycin, PD-0325901 and dasatinib were found to be more effective for patients in the high-risk group, whereas AZD7762, CEP-701 and methotrexate were predicted to be more effective for patients in the low-risk group.

The pathophysiology was outlined by RNA-sequencing of mucosal biopsies from non-inflamed and inflamed colon of UC patients (14 and 17, respectively), and from 27 patients without intestinal inflammation. Genes differentially expressed (DE), or present in enriched gene sets, were investigated using statistical text analysis of functional protein information. Compared with controls, inflamed and non-inflamed UC mucosa displayed 9360 and 52 DE genes, respectively. Seventy-three non-pseudogenes were DE relative to both gender and inflammation. Mitochondrial processes were downregulated in inflamed and upregulated in non-inflamed UC mucosa, whereas angiogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were upregulated in both tissue states. Immune responses were upregulated in inflamed mucosa, whereas the non-inflamed UC mucosa presented both up- and downregulated gene sets. DE and enriched genes overlapped with genes present in inflammatory bowel disease genome-wide associated loci (p = 1.43 × 10−18), especially regarding immune responses, respiratory chain, angiogenesis, ER stress, and steroid hormone metabolism.

Autoreactive CD4 T cell effector subsets (Th1,Th17) driving these diseases require increased glycolytic metabolism to upregulate key transcription factors (TF) like T-bet and RORγt that drive differentiation and proinflammatory responses. However, research in immunometabolism has demonstrated that mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules contributing to T cell fate and function. Eliminating autoreactive T cells by targeting glycolysis or ROS production is a potential strategy to inhibit autoreactive T cell activation without compromising systemic immune function. Additionally, increasing self-tolerance by promoting functional immunosuppressive CD4 T regulatory (Treg) cells is another alternative therapeutic for autoimmune disease. Tregs require increased ROS and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) for Foxp3 TF expression, differentiation, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine synthesis. Decreasing glycolytic activity or increasing glutathione and superoxide dismutase antioxidant activity can also be beneficial in inhibiting cytotoxic CD8 T cell effector responses. Current treatment options for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include global immunosuppression, antibodies to deplete immune cells, and anti-cytokine therapy. While effective in diminishing autoreactive T cells, they can also compromise other immune responses resulting in increased susceptibility to other diseases and complications. The impact of mitochondrial-derived ROS and immunometabolism reprogramming in autoreactive T cell differentiation could be a potential target for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Exploiting these pathways may delay autoimmune responses in T1D.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,12,N/A,2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,83,171,"M.

We defined a somatization comorbidity phenotype (SCP) and examined its influence on response to certolizumab pegol (CZP) using data from the PREDICT trial.MethodsPatients in PREDICT were randomized to the patient-reported Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) or physician-based Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for treatment response assessment. Post-hoc analyses identified patients with the SCP, which included diagnosis of depression, fibromyalgia/myalgias, and/or use of medications indicated for treatment of depression, anxiety, or neuropathic pain. The effect of the SCP on RAPID3 or CDAI response at week 12 and low disease activity (LDA; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≤ 3.2) at week 52, in week-12 responders, was analyzed using non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).ResultsAt baseline, 43% (313/733) of patients met the SCP classification. Patients with the SCP were 9% more likely to withdraw from the trial. American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses were 5–14% lower among those with the SCP, and 11% more patients reported adverse events (AEs). Patients without SCP in the CDAI arm were twice as likely to achieve LDA at week 52 compared with those with SCP (32% versus 16%). No differentiation by SCP was observed in the RAPID3 arm (pooled result 21.5%).ConclusionsWe operationalized a potentially important somatization comorbidity phenotype in a trial setting that was associated with a substantially lower likelihood of treatment response and a higher frequency of AEs. Including large numbers of patients with this phenotype in RA trials may reduce the measured clinical effectiveness of a new molecule.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01255761.

A National Population-Based Study of 162,283 Danish Adults","Objectives To identify patterns of multimorbidity in the general population and examine how these patterns are related to socio-demographic factors and health-related quality of life. Study design and setting We used latent class analysis to identify subgroups with statistically distinct and clinically meaningful disease patterns in a nationally representative sample of Danish adults (N = 162,283) aged 16+ years. The analysis was based on 15 chronic diseases. Results Seven classes with different disease patterns were identified: a class with no or only a single chronic condition (59% of the population) labeled “1) Relatively Healthy” and six classes with a very high prevalence of multimorbidity labeled; “2) Hypertension” (14%); “3) Musculoskeletal Disorders” (10%); “4) Headache-Mental Disorders” (7%); “5) Asthma-Allergy” (6%); “6) Complex Cardiometabolic Disorders” (3%); and “7) Complex Respiratory Disorders” (2%). Female gender was associated with an increased likelihood of belonging to any of the six multimorbidity classes except for class 2 (Hypertension). Low educational attainment predicted membership of all of the multimorbidity classes except for class 5 (Asthma-Allergy). Marked differences in health-related quality of life between the seven latent classes were found. Poor health-related quality of life was highly associated with membership of class 6 (Complex Cardiometabolic Disorders) and class 7 (Complex Respiratory Disorders). Despite different disease patterns, these two classes had nearly identical profiles in relation to health-related quality of life. Conclusion The results clearly support that diseases tend to compound and interact, which suggests that a differentiated public health and treatment approach towards multimorbidity is needed.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,12,N/A,2017,2017-01-05 00:00:00,131,53,"F.

The paper investigates a method to represent model error in the ensemble data assimilation (EDA) system. The ECMWF operational EDA simulates the effect of both observations and model uncertainties. Observation errors are represented by perturbations with statistics characterized by the observation error covariance matrix whilst the model uncertainties are represented by stochastic perturbations added to the physical tendencies to simulate the effect of random errors in the physical parameterizations (ST-method). In this work an alternative method (XB-method) is proposed to simulate model uncertainties by adding perturbations to the model background field. In this way the error represented is not just restricted to model error in the usual sense but potentially extends to any form of background error. The perturbations have the same correlation as the background error covariance matrix and their magnitude is computed from comparing the high-resolution operational innovation variances with the ensemble variances when the ensemble is obtained by perturbing only the observations (OBS-method). The XB-method has been designed to represent the short range model error relevant for the data assimilation window. Spread diagnostic shows that the XB-method generates a larger spread than the ST-method that is operationally used at ECMWF, in particular in the extratropics. Three-dimensional normal-mode diagnostics indicate that XB-EDA spread projects more than the spread from the other EDAs onto the easterly inertia-gravity modes associated with equatorial Kelvin waves, tropical dynamics and, in general, model error sources. The background error statistics from the above described EDAs have been employed in the assimilation system. The assimilation system performance showed that the XB-method background error statistics increase the observation influence in the analysis process. The other EDA background error statistics, when inflated by a global factor, generate analyses with 30–50% smaller degree of freedom of signal. XB-EDA background error variances have not been inflated. The presented EDAs have been used to generate the initial perturbations of the ECMWF ensemble prediction system (EPS) of which the XB-EDA induces the largest EPS spread, also in the medium range, leading to a more reliable ensemble. Compared to ST-EDA, XB-EDA leads to a small improvement of the EPS ignorance skill score at day 3 and 7.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics,971-985,21,Unknown,2014,2014-09-23 00:00:00,17,53,"C.

A convective parameterization is described and evaluated that may be used in high resolution non-hydrostatic mesoscale models as well as in modeling system with unstructured varying grid resolutions and for convection aware simulations. This scheme is based on a stochastic approach originally implemented by Grell and Devenyi (2002). Two approaches are tested on resolutions ranging from 20 km to 5 km. One approach is based on spreading subsidence to neighboring grid points, the other one on a recently introduced method by Arakawa et al. (2011). Results from model intercomparisons, as well as verification with observations indicate that both the spreading of the subsidence and Arakawa's approach work well for the highest resolution runs. Because of its simplicity and its capability for an automatic smooth transition as the resolution is increased, Arakawa's approach may be preferred. Additionally, interactions with aerosols have been implemented through a cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) dependent autoconversion of cloud water to rain as well as an aerosol dependent evaporation of cloud drops. Initial tests with this newly implemented aerosol approach show plausible results with a decrease in predicted precipitation in some areas, caused by the changed autoconversion mechanism. This change also causes a significant increase of cloud water and ice detrainment near the cloud tops. Some areas also experience an increase of precipitation, most likely caused by strengthened downdrafts.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,5233-5250,14,Unknown,2013,2013-09-11 00:00:00,963,43,"G.

In this study, a brief history and the state of the art in optical illumination, image acquisition, image processing, and image analysis in the field of visual inspection are systematically discussed. The latest developments in industrial defect detection based on machine vision are introduced. In the further development of the field of visual inspection, the application of deep learning will play an increasingly important role.

The lack of actual hot-rolled strip defect data sets currently limits further research on the classification of hot-rolled strip defects to some extent. In real production, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm has some difficulties, for example, the algorithm is not particularly accurate in classifying some uncommon defects. Therefore, further research is needed on how to apply deep learning to the actual detection of defects on the surface of hot rolled steel strip. In this paper, we proposed a hot rolled steel strip defect dataset called Xsteel surface defect dataset (X-SDD) which contains seven typical types of hot rolled strip defects with a total of 1360 defect images. Compared with the six defect types of the commonly used NEU surface defect database (NEU-CLS), our proposed X-SDD contains more types. Then, we adopt the newly proposed RepVGG algorithm and combine it with the spatial attention (SA) mechanism to verify the effect on the X-SDD. Finally, we apply multiple algorithms to test on our proposed X-SDD to provide the corresponding benchmarks. The test results show that our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 95.10% on the testset, which exceeds other comparable algorithms by a large margin. Meanwhile, our algorithm achieves the best results in Macro-Precision, Macro-Recall and Macro-F1-score metrics.",Symmetry,journal,['JournalArticle'],1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,706,13,N/A,2021,2021-04-17 00:00:00,98,45,"Xinglong Feng, Xian-wen Gao, Ling Luo","1641383061, 1797939, None",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff8ad53f6591409b3dd1c7947ca32d49ca3dc569,"Computer Science, Engineering, Materials Science",1641383061

Deep learning on visual images is effective in the automatic detection of railhead defects, but either intensive data requirements or ignoring defect sizes reduce its applicability. This paper developed a machine learning framework based on wavelet scattering networks (WSNs) and neural networks (NNs) for identifying railhead defects. WSNs are functionally equivalent to deep convolutional neural networks while containing no parameters, thus suitable for non-intensive datasets. NNs can restore location and size information. The publicly available rail surface discrete defects (RSDD) datasets were analyzed, including 67 Type-I railhead images acquired from express tracks and 128 Type-II images captured from ordinary/heavy haul tracks. The ultimate validation accuracy reached 99.80% and 99.44%, respectively. WSNs can extract implicit signal features, and the support vector machine classifier can improve the learning accuracy of NNs by over 6%. Three criteria, namely the precision, recall, and F-measure, were calculated for comparison with the literature. At the pixel level, the developed approach achieved three criteria of around 90%, outperforming former methods. At the defect level, the recall rates reached 100%, indicating all labeled defects were identified. The precision rates were around 75%, affected by the insignificant misidentified speckles (smaller than 20 pixels). Nonetheless, the developed learning framework was effective in identifying railhead defects.",Materials,journal,['JournalArticle'],0b8373ea-5505-4c96-99ff-b8da87a2ce3e,Materials,,14,N/A,2021,2021-04-01 00:00:00,10,43,Yang Jin,2122755150,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca41132c7a80c07ca516e236dc3bad527e5a9cb1,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",2122755150

However, the traditional method cannot be well applied in the production line, because of its low accuracy and slow running speed. The current, popular algorithm (based on deep learning) also has the problem of low accuracy, and there is still a lot of room for improvement. This paper proposes a method combining improved ResNet50 and enhanced faster region convolutional neural networks (faster R-CNN) to reduce the average running time and improve the accuracy. Firstly, the image input into the improved ResNet50 model, which add the deformable revolution network (DCN) and improved cutout to classify the sample with defects and without defects. If the probability of having a defect is less than 0.3, the algorithm directly outputs the sample without defects. Otherwise, the samples are further input into the improved faster R-CNN, which adds spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), enhanced feature pyramid networks (FPN), and matrix NMS. The final output is the location and classification of the defect in the sample or without defect in the sample. By analyzing the data set obtained in the real factory environment, the accuracy of this method can reach 98.2%. At the same time, the average running time is faster than other models.",Metals,,,c6119658-6645-4c6e-90d8-d6cfe758ed2b,Metals,,,Unknown,2021,2021-02-26 00:00:00,114,44,"Shuai Wang, Xiaojun Xia, Lanqing Ye, Binbin Yang","2118511832, 1486163905, 2049465984, 2035516807",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f7c5252b1225008916c3c098bd1f17d6025333e,"Computer Science, Engineering, Materials Science",2118511832

However, it is difficult to visually analyze ECG signals due to their complexity and nonlinearity. The wavelet scattering transform can generate translation-invariant and deformation-stable representations of ECG signals through cascades of wavelet convolutions with nonlinear modulus and averaging operators. We proposed a novel approach using wavelet scattering transform to automatically classify four categories of arrhythmia ECG heartbeats, namely, nonectopic (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V), and fusion (F) beats. In this study, the wavelet scattering transform extracted 8 time windows from each ECG heartbeat. Two dimensionality reduction methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and time window selection, were applied on the 8 time windows. These processed features were fed to the neural network (NN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifiers for classification. The 4th time window in combination with KNN (k = 4) has achieved the optimal performance with an averaged accuracy, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.3%, 99.6%, 99.5%, and 98.8%, respectively, using tenfold cross-validation.

However, the trained model does work well when a new production line is initiated with different equipment, processes, or detection devices. These variables make just tiny changes to the real-world model but have a significant impact on the classification result. To overcome these problems, we propose an evolutionary classifier with a Bayes kernel (BYEC) that can be adjusted with a small sample set to better adapt the model for a new production line. First, abundant features were introduced to cover detailed information about the defects. Second, we constructed a series of support vector machines (SVMs) with a random subspace of the features. Then, a Bayes classifier was trained as an evolutionary kernel fused with the results from the sub-SVM to form an integrated classifier. Finally, we proposed a method to adjust the Bayes evolutionary kernel with a small sample set. We compared the performance of this method to various algorithms; experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be adjusted with a small sample set to fit the changed model.

This work aims to develop and pilot a methodology to help decision makers target and prioritize sampling investigations and identify contaminated natural resources. Here we use random forest models to predict ∑PFAS in fish tissue; understanding PFAS levels in fish is particularly important in the CRB because fish can be a major component of tribal and indigenous people diet. Geospatial data, including land cover and distances to known or potential PFAS sources and industries, were leveraged as predictors for modeling. Models were developed and evaluated for Washington state and Oregon using limited available empirical data. Mapped predictions show several areas where detectable concentrations of PFAS in fish tissue are predicted to occur, but prior sampling has not yet confirmed. Variable importance is analyzed to identify potentially important sources of PFAS in fish in this region. The cost-effective methodologies demonstrated here can help address sparsity of existing PFAS occurrence data in environmental media in this and other regions while also giving insights into potentially important drivers and sources of PFAS in fish.",Environmental Science and Technology,journal,['JournalArticle'],9efb20cf-7484-450d-8245-12dfbf639d3e,Environmental Science & Technology,14024 - 14035,57,N/A,2023,2023-09-05 00:00:00,10,29,"N.

Here, the authors assess gut microbiota in early PD, REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and first-degree relatives of RBD and show PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs in RBD and their first-degree relatives. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been suggested to play an important role in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we performed a cross-sectional study to profile gut microbiota across early PD, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), first-degree relatives of RBD (RBD-FDR), and healthy controls, which could reflect the gut-brain staging model of PD. We show gut microbiota compositions are significantly altered in early PD and RBD compared with control and RBD-FDR. Depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and enrichment of pro-inflammatory Collinsella have already emerged in RBD and RBD-FDR after controlling potential confounders including antidepressants, osmotic laxatives, and bowel movement frequency. Random forest modelling identifies 12 microbial markers that are effective to distinguish RBD from control. These findings suggest that PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs at the prodromal stages of PD when RBD develops and starts to emerge in the younger RBD-FDR subjects.

Currently, we only have a limited understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of soil microorganisms, restricting our ability to assess long-term effects of climate and land-cover change on microbial roles in soil biogeochemistry. This study assesses the temporal trends in soil microbial biomass carbon and identifies the main drivers of biomass change regionally and globally to detect the areas sensitive to these environmental factors. Here, we combined a global soil microbial biomass carbon data set, random forest modelling, and environmental layers to predict spatial-temporal dynamics of microbial biomass carbon stocks from 1992 to 2013. Soil microbial biomass carbon stocks decreased globally by 3.4 ± 3.0% (mean ± 95% CI) between 1992 and 2013 for the predictable regions, equivalent to 149 Mt being lost over the period, or ~1‰ of soil C. Northern areas with high soil microbial carbon stocks experienced the strongest decrease, mostly driven by increasing temperatures. In contrast, land-cover change was a weaker global driver of change in microbial carbon, but had, in some cases, important regional effects. Soil microbial carbon is central to soil functions and services, but its spatial-temporal dynamics are unclear. Here the authors show global trends in soil microbial carbon, which suggests a global decrease in soil microbial carbon, mostly driven by temperature increases in northern areas.",Nature Communications,journal,['JournalArticle'],43b3f0f9-489a-4566-8164-02fafde3cd98,Nature Communications,,13,N/A,2022,2022-07-20 00:00:00,63,78,"Guillaume Patoine, N.

The annual revenue generated by fraud exceeds $1 trillion. Even while fraud is dangerous for organizations, it may be uncovered with the help of intelligent solutions such as rules engines and machine learning. In this research, we introduce a unique hybrid technique for identifying financial payment fraud by combining nature-inspired-based Hyperparameter tuning with several supervised classifier models, as implemented in a modified version of the XGBoost Algorithm. At the outset, we split out a sample of the full financial payment dataset to use as a test set. We use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. Records that are known to be illegitimate or fraudulent are predicted, while those that raise suspicion are further investigated using a number of machine learning algorithms. The models are trained and validated using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. Several tests using a dataset of actual financial transactions are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2022,2022-12-09 00:00:00,17,53,"Surjeet Dalal, Bijeta Seth, M.

The inclusion of such attributes makes analysis harder, due to results with poorer generalization and higher resource usage. A common practice is, therefore, to ignore such attributes, removing them, albeit wasting the information they provided. Contrariwise, this paper reports our findings on the positive impacts of using high-cardinality attributes on credit card fraud detection. Thus, we present a new algorithm for domain reduction that preserves the fraud-detection capabilities. Experiments applying a deep feedforward neural network on real datasets from a major Brazilian financial institution have shown that, when measured by the F-1 metric, the inclusion of such attributes does improve fraud-detection quality. As a main contribution, this proposed algorithm was able to reduce attribute cardinality, improving the training times of a model while preserving its predictive capabilities.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2022,2022-10-15 00:00:00,6,56,"E.

To detect crimes such as credit card fraud, several single and hybrid machine learning approaches have been used. However, these approaches have significant limitations as no further investigation on different hybrid algorithms for a given dataset were studied. This research proposes and investigates seven hybrid machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities with a real word dataset. The developed hybrid models consisted of two phases, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms were used first to detect credit card fraud, then, hybrid methods were constructed based on the best single algorithm from the first phase. Our findings indicated that the hybrid model Adaboost + LGBM is the champion model as it displayed the highest performance.

One of the crucial issues with using credit cards is fraud, which is a serious challenge in the realm of online transactions. Consequently, there is a huge need to develop the best approach possible to using machine learning in order to prevent almost all fraudulent credit card transactions. This paper studies a total of 66 machine learning models based on two stages of evaluation. A real-world credit card fraud detection dataset of European cardholders is used in each model along with stratified K-fold cross-validation. In the first stage, nine machine learning algorithms are tested to detect fraudulent transactions. The best three algorithms are nominated to be used again in the second stage, with 19 resampling techniques used with each one of the best three algorithms. Out of 330 evaluation metric values that took nearly one month to obtain, the All K-Nearest Neighbors (AllKNN) undersampling technique along with CatBoost (AllKNN-CatBoost) is considered to be the best proposed model. Accordingly, the AllKNN-CatBoost model is compared with related works. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms previous models with an AUC value of 97.94%, a Recall value of 95.91%, and an F1-Score value of 87.40%.",Electronics,journal,,ccd8e532-73c6-414f-bc91-271bbb2933e2,Electronics,,,N/A,2022,2022-02-21 00:00:00,100,23,"Noor Saleh Alfaiz, S.

For this end, it is obligatory for financial institutions to continuously improve their fraud detection systems to reduce huge losses. The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel system for credit card fraud detection based on sequential modeling of data, using attention mechanism and LSTM deep recurrent neural networks. The proposed model, compared to previous studies, considers the sequential nature of transactional data and allows the classifier to identify the most important transactions in the input sequence that predict at higher accuracy fraudulent transactions. Precisely, the robustness of our model is built by combining the strength of three sub-methods; the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for selecting the most useful predictive features, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for incorporating transaction sequences and the attention mechanism to enhance LSTM performances.

Idiopathic RBD occurs in the absence of any neurological disease or other possible cause, is male-predominant and its clinical course is generally chronic progressive. Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders. Because RBD antecedes the development of these disorders by several years or decades, its recognition may enable the delay or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders through the early application of neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapies in the future.",The EPMA Journal,journal,['JournalArticle'],5c44f3b8-070b-4771-88c8-57717d28f5ab,The EPMA Journal,451 - 458,2,N/A,2011,2011-06-29 00:00:00,24,90,S.

Deep learning has been widely applied in medical imaging to help automate and improve medical image analysis. Medical imaging techniques such as MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays produce large amounts of data that can be difficult for human experts to accurately interpret and analyze. Deep learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns in medical images, identify abnormal features, and make predictions about patient outcomes. The present research work exposes an automatic classification model to detect brain tumors in brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). The data set is found in the Kaggle repository, which consists of 253 MRI images: 155 with brain tumors and 98 without. The proposed model can classify brain tumor MRI images with 91% accuracy. Therefore, the model represents an auxiliary tool to existing conventional methods for the diagnosis of brain tumors.",International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning,journal,['JournalArticle'],4f80dbcd-1873-4e18-8fd1-099686d82278,International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning,,,N/A,2023,2023-11-10 00:00:00,56,0,"Omar Villalpando-Vargas, Aron Hernández-Trinidad, T.

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,13,N/A,2018,2018-03-27 00:00:00,992,90,"Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, Vassilios Assimakopoulos","2276105, 2146553, 90170330",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6b3aeb29b5b4034d84598424b1edfb29acf2a6c,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Medicine",2276105

While most contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales. An E(3)-equivariant deep learning interatomic potential is introduced for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations.

However, in the big data environment, the ELM based on the Moore–Penrose matrix inverse still suffers from excessive calculation loads. Leveraging the decomposability of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a convex model-fitting problem can be split into a set of sub-problems which can be executed in parallel. Using a maximally splitting technique and a relaxation technique, the sub-problems can be split into multiple univariate sub-problems. On this basis, we propose an adaptive parameter selection method that automatically tunes the key algorithm parameters during training. To confirm the effectiveness of this algorithm, experiments are conducted on eight classification datasets. We have verified the effectiveness of this algorithm in terms of the number of iterations, computation time, and acceleration ratios. The results show that the method proposed by this paper can greatly improve the speed of data processing while increasing the parallelism.",Mathematics,,['JournalArticle'],6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-07-21 00:00:00,4,40,"Zhangquan Wang, Shanshan Huo, Xinlong Xiong, Ke Wang, Banteng Liu","2108404908, 6790096, 2224755388, 2208444356, 3330131",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa3eac354d4a22ae12451148e33e774bdb37aebc,"Computer Science, Mathematics",2108404908

The pandemic has created high volatility and caused extreme fluctuations in the stock market. The stock market can be characterized as either linear or nonlinear. One method that can detect extreme fluctuations is extreme value theory (EVT). This study employed a semisystematic literature review on the use of the EVT method to estimate investment risk in the stock market. The literature used was selected by applying the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, sourced from the ScienceDirect.com, ProQuest, and Scopus databases. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to determine the study characteristics and identify any research gaps. The results of the analysis show that studies on this topic are rarely carried out. Research in this field is generally performed only in univariate cases and is very complicated in multivariate cases. Given these limitations, further research could focus on developing a conceptual model that is dynamic and sensitive to extreme fluctuations, with multivariable inputs, in order to predict investment risk. The model developed here considered the variables that affect stock price fluctuations as the input data. The combination of VaR–EVT and machine-learning methods is effective in increasing model accuracy because it combines linear and nonlinear models.",Risks,,['Review'],eedb1527-2aee-4def-bdb2-20fca9c12c3d,Risks,,,Unknown,2023,2023-03-14 00:00:00,22,51,"Melina, Sukono, H.

The HAR plays a vital role in learning about a patient’s abnormal activities; based upon this information, the patient’s psychological state can be estimated. An epileptic seizure is a neurological disorder of the human brain and affects millions of people worldwide. If epilepsy is diagnosed correctly and in an early stage, then up to 70% of people can be seizure-free. There is a need for intelligent automatic HAR systems that help clinicians diagnose neurological disorders accurately. In this research, we proposed a Deep Learning (DL) model that enables the detection of epileptic seizures in an automated way, addressing a need in clinical research. To recognize epileptic seizures from brain activities, EEG is a raw but good source of information. In previous studies, many techniques used raw data from EEG to help recognize epileptic patient activities; however, the applied method of extracting features required much intensive expertise from clinical aspects such as radiology and clinical methods. The image data are also used to diagnose epileptic seizures, but applying Machine Learning (ML) methods could address the overfitting problem. In this research, we mainly focused on classifying epilepsy through physical epileptic activities instead of feature engineering and performed the detection of epileptic seizures in three steps. In the first step, we used the open-source numerical dataset of epilepsy of Bonn university from the UCI Machine Learning repository. In the second step, data were fed to the proposed ELM model for training in different training and testing ratios with a little bit of rescaling because the dataset was already pre-processed, normalized, and restructured. In the third step, epileptic and non-epileptic activity was recognized, and in this step, EEG signal feature extraction was automatically performed by a DL model named ELM; features were selected by a Feature Selection (FS) algorithm based on ELM and the final classification was performed using the ELM classifier. In our presented research, seven different ML algorithms were applied for the binary classification of epileptic activities, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Boosting Classifier (SGDC), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GB), Decision Trees (DT), and three deep learning models named Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). After deep analysis, it is observed that the best results were obtained by our proposed DL model, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), with an accuracy of 100% accuracy and a 0.99 AUC. Such high performance has not attained in previous research. The proposed model’s performance was checked with other models in terms of performance parameters, namely confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, sensitivity, and the ROC curve.",Biomedicines,journal,['JournalArticle'],abc0c598-b988-4841-a8c5-65bfa6f3df77,Biomedicines,,11,N/A,2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,15,42,"Ummara Ayman, M.

Design Prospective feasibility study. Setting The study was conducted in a university setting and participants’ homes. Participants Thirty-five volunteers ≥55 years old were recruited. Intervention Participants were asked to follow a balance exercise programme 7 days a week for 3 weeks using a phone application. Seventeen participants trained for a further 3 weeks. Outcome measures Postural sway measures during quiet standing with feet at shoulder width apart and feet together, one leg standing and tandem stance were measured at baseline, and at the end of the 3 and 6 training weeks; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) assessed participants’ physical activity level before training; and app acceptability was recorded using a user experience questionnaire. Results Participants on the 3 and 6-week programme on average completed 20 (±5) and 38 (±11) days of training, respectively, and all scored moderate to high on the IPAQ. Between baseline and the 3-week assessments, statistically significant improvements were observed for anteroposterior sway, mediolateral sway, sway area during tandem stance, for anteroposterior sway during one leg standing and for sway area during feet together stance. Improvements were observed at 6 week compared with baseline but those between 3 and 6 weeks were not significant. Based on the questionnaire, participants reported that the app is an appropriate tool for balance training (77%), they reported benefits from the training (50%) and found it easy to fit it into daily routine (88%). Conclusion The high level of adherence and improvements observed in the analysed measures demonstrate the feasibility of using an app to train balance in moderately to highly physically active older participants. This demonstrates that given appropriate tools the older population is positive towards and receptive of digital interventions aimed to improve balance.",BMJ Open,journal,['JournalArticle'],e6216b43-2428-4aaf-8101-b40e1dfd2810,BMJ Open,,10,N/A,2020,2020-12-01 00:00:00,11,50,"E.

Activity levels are generally below recommended levels and reduce with age. There is concern that exercise levels may be further reduced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital approaches may offer a means for older people to engage in strength and balance exercises independently in their own homes. The objective of this review was to identify and evaluate existing apps and websites to support independent engagement in strength and balance exercises by older people. Methods We conducted a rapid review of apps and websites, following PRISMA guidelines. We searched for available apps in the Android and iOS app stores, and performed a database search (MEDLINE and EMBASE) for apps in development. We searched for websites using the Google search engine. Apps and websites were evaluated in terms of existing evidence for effectiveness, use of behaviour change techniques (BCTs), and quality. Results We evaluated 13 apps and 24 websites on the basis of our selection criteria. Considering the evidence-base, quality and BCT scores, four apps and six websites are recommended for use by older people who wish to engage in exercise independently in their own homes. No apps or websites have been to RCT evaluation at the time of review. Conclusions Apps and websites have the potential to provide a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means for many older adults to engage in strength and balance training and reduce falls risk.",BMC Geriatrics,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",f0ed97d4-5d9b-4cb1-892a-ae0f91b368bc,BMC Geriatrics,,20,N/A,2020,2020-08-24 00:00:00,34,41,"L.

In current clinical practice, falls (and associated fall risk) are often self-reported after the “first fall”, delaying primary prevention of falls and development of targeted fall prevention interventions. Current methods for assessing falls risk can be subjective, inaccurate, have low inter-rater reliability, and do not address factors contributing to falls (poor balance, gait speed, transfers, turning). 8521 participants (72.7 ± 12.0 years, 5392 female) from six countries were assessed using a digital falls risk assessment protocol. Data consisted of wearable sensor data captured during the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test along with self-reported questionnaire data on falls risk factors, applied to previously trained and validated classifier models. We found that 25.8% of patients reported a fall in the previous 12 months, of the 74.6% of participants that had not reported a fall, 21.5% were found to have a high predicted risk of falls. Overall 26.2% of patients were predicted to be at high risk of falls. 29.8% of participants were found to have slow walking speed, while 19.8% had high gait variability and 17.5% had problems with transfers. We report an observational study of results obtained from a novel digital fall risk assessment protocol. This protocol is intended to support the early identification of older adults at risk of falls and inform the creation of appropriate personalized interventions to prevent falls. A population-based approach to management of falls using objective measures of falls risk and mobility impairment, may help reduce unnecessary outpatient and emergency department utilization by improving risk prediction and stratification, driving more patients towards clinical and community-based falls prevention activities.",npj Digital Medicine,,['JournalArticle'],ef485645-f75f-4344-8b9d-3c260e69503b,NPJ Digital Medicine,,2,Unknown,2019,2019-12-01 00:00:00,39,64,"B.

Materials and Methods We searched bibliographic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane libraries from January 2013 to May 2019 for articles about health apps. Descriptive information about safety concerns and consequences were extracted and classified into natural categories. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) statement. Results Of the 74 studies identified, the majority were reviews of a single or a group of similar apps (n = 66, 89%), nearly half related to disease management (n = 34, 46%). A total of 80 safety concerns were identified, 67 related to the quality of information presented including incorrect or incomplete information, variation in content, and incorrect or inappropriate response to consumer needs. The remaining 13 related to app functionality including gaps in features, lack of validation for user input, delayed processing, failure to respond to health dangers, and faulty alarms. Of the 52 reports of actual or potential consequences, 5 had potential for patient harm. We also identified 66 reports about gaps in app development, including the lack of expert involvement, poor evidence base, and poor validation. Conclusions Safety of apps is an emerging public health issue. The available evidence shows that apps pose clinical risks to consumers. Involvement of consumers, regulators, and healthcare professionals in development and testing can improve quality.

Patient-driven self-assessment as a preventive measure might be a solution to reduce the number of patients undergoing a full clinical fall risk assessment. Objective The aim of this study was (1) to analyze test accuracy of the Aachen Falls Prevention Scale (AFPS) and (2) to compare these results with established fall risk assessment measures identified by a review of systematic reviews. Methods Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating curves (ROC) of the AFPS were calculated based on data retrieved from 2 independent studies using the AFPS. Comparison with established fall risk assessment measures was made by conducting a review of systematic reviews and corresponding meta-analysis. Electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses that reviewed fall risk assessment measures between the years 2000 and 2018. The review of systematic reviews was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. The Revised Assessment of Multiple SysTemAtic Reviews (R-AMSTAR) was used to assess the methodological quality of reviews. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC were extracted from each review and compared with the calculated values of the AFPS. Results Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC of the AFPS were evaluated based on 2 studies including a total of 259 older adults. Regarding the primary outcome of the AFPS subjective risk of falling, pooled sensitivity is 57.0% (95% CI 0.467-0.669) and specificity is 76.7% (95% CI 0.694-0.831). If 1 out of the 3 subscales of the AFPS is used to predict a fall risk, pooled sensitivity could be increased up to 90.0% (95% CI 0.824-0.951), whereas mean specificity thereby decreases to 50.0% (95% CI 0.42-0.58). A systematic review for fall risk assessment measures produced 1478 articles during the study period, with 771 coming from PubMed, 530 from Web of Science, and 177 from EMBASE. After eliminating doublets and assessing full text, 8 reviews met the inclusion criteria. All were of sufficient methodological quality (R-AMSTAR score ≥22). A total number of 9 functional or multifactorial fall risk assessment measures were extracted from identified reviews, including Timed Up and Go test, Berg Balance Scale, Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment, St Thomas’s Risk Assessment Tool in Falling Elderly, and Hendrich II Fall Risk Model. Comparison of these measures with pooled sensitivity and specificity of the AFPS revealed a sufficient quality of the AFPS in terms of a patient-driven self-assessment tool. Conclusions It could be shown that the AFPS reaches a test accuracy comparable with that of the established methods in this initial investigation. However, it offers the advantage that the users can perform the self-assessment independently at home without involving trained health care professionals.",JMIR Aging,,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",9fe230fc-d0a3-45d6-86ab-82ae6e7fc46b,JMIR Aging,,2,Unknown,2019,2019-05-16 00:00:00,8,41,"P.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has contrasted web-expressions of Indian English in noisy social media with English generated by a social media user base that are predominantly native speakers. In this paper, we address this gap in the literature through conducting a comprehensive analysis considering multiple structural and semantic aspects. In addition, we propose a novel application of language models to perform automatic linguistic quality assessment.",WNUT,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,,61-70,,Unknown,2020,2020-11-01 00:00:00,11,50,"Rupak Sarkar, Sayantan Mahinder, Ashiqur R.

While these messages can indicate differences in beliefs and behaviors between demographic groups, we do not have a clear understanding of how different demographic groups use platforms such as Twitter. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of how groups’ differing behaviors may confound analyses of the groups themselves. We analyzed one million Twitter users by first inferring demographic attributes, and then measuring several indicators of Twitter behavior. We find differences in these indicators across demographic groups, suggesting that there may be underlying differences in how different demographic groups use Twitter.",NLP+CSS@ACL,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,,83-89,,Unknown,2017,2017-08-01 00:00:00,26,33,"Zach Wood-Doughty, Michael Smith, David A.

Although the sentiment analysis uses such data to develop useful applications in people’s daily lives, there are still failures in this type of analysis, either by the restricted number of words contained in the word dictionaries or because they do not consider the most diverse parameters that can influence the sentiments in a sentence; thus, more reliable results can be obtained, if the users profile information and their writing characteristics are considered. This research suggests that one of the most relevant parameter contained in the user profile is the age group, showing that there are typical behaviors among users of the same age group, specifically, when these users write about the same topic. A detailed analysis with 7000 sentences was performed to determine which characteristics are relevant, such as, the use of punctuation, number of characters, media sharing, topics, among others; and which ones can be disregarded for the age groups classification. Different learning machine algorithms are tested for the classification of the teenager and adult age group, and the deep convolutional neural network had the best performance, reaching a precision of 0.95 in the validation tests. Furthermore, in order to validate the usefulness of the proposed model for classifying age groups, it is implemented into the enhanced sentiment metric (eSM). In the performance validation, subjective tests are performed and the eSM with the proposed model reached a root mean square error and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.25 and 0.94, respectively, outperforming the eSM metric, when the age group information is not available.",IEEE Access,journal,['JournalArticle'],2633f5b2-c15c-49fe-80f5-07523e770c26,IEEE Access,10805-10816,5,N/A,2017,2017-05-23 00:00:00,93,69,"R.

As a result, it is crucial for companies to implement robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive data from intrusion, which can lead to significant financial losses. Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) require further enhancements to reduce false positives as well as enhance overall accuracy. To minimize security risks, data analytics and machine learning can be utilized to create data-driven recommendations and decisions based on the input data. This study focuses on developing machine learning models that can identify cyber-attacks and enhance IDS system performance. This paper employed logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest algorithms on the UNSW-NB15 network traffic dataset, utilizing in-depth exploratory data analysis, and feature selection using correlation analysis and random sampling to compare model accuracy and effectiveness. The performance and confusion matrix results indicate that the Random Forest model is the best option for identifying cyber-attacks, with a remarkable F1 score of 97.80%, accuracy of 98.63%, and low false alarm rate of 1.36%, and thus should be considered to improve IDS system security.",Algorithms,journal,['JournalArticle'],e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,64,17,N/A,2024,2024-02-01 00:00:00,18,28,"Shweta More, Moad Idrissi, Haitham H.

These anomalies include narrow cell mini-columns and variable neuron density. However, difficulty obtaining sufficient post-mortem samples has often prevented investigations from converging on reproducible measures. Recent advances in processing magnetic resonance diffusion weighted images (DWI) make in vivo characterization of neuronal cytoarchitecture a potential alternative to post-mortem studies. Using extensive DWI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmentsm (ABCD®) study 142 individuals with an Autism diagnosis were compared with 8971 controls using a restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) framework that characterized total neurite density (TND), its component restricted normalized directional diffusion (RND), and restricted normalized isotropic diffusion (RNI). A significant decrease in TND was observed in Autism in the right cerebellar cortex (β=-0.005, SE =0.0015, p=0.0267), with significant decreases in RNI and significant increases in RND found diffusely throughout posterior and anterior aspects of the brain, respectively. Furthermore, these regions remained significant in post-hoc analysis when the ASD sample was compared against a subset of 1404 individuals with other psychiatric conditions (pulled from the original 8971). These findings highlight the importance of characterizing neuron cytoarchitecture in Autism and the significance of their incorporation as physiological covariates in future studies. Lay abstract Children with autism have differences in neuron structure unique from the general population and populations with attention, anxiety, and depression disorders. Brain imaging data on over 11,000 children was acquired at ages 9 and 11 years-of-age. Estimates of neuron density were derived from brain imaging data using recently validated techniques and comparative groups were composed using parent reported diagnosis of autism and other common psychiatric disorders. Consistent macro-structural changes in brain have been difficult to replicate and micro-structural changes have been historically difficult to acquire with other methodologies. We identified regional differences in the density of neuron cell bodies, neuron branching, and total neuron density in those with a reported diagnosis of ASD. Findings were consistent when compared against those with other psychiatric disorders in post-hoc analysis. These findings demonstrate the viability and importance of investigating in vivo changes to neurons in those with autism to advance our current understanding of related physiology.",bioRxiv,journal,['JournalArticle'],027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0,bioRxiv,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-26 00:00:00,3,86,"Z.

Quantitative measurement of T1 and T2 relaxation, and diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) yield metrics related to the pathology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that occurs across the spectrum of MS. Objective: To use relaxation and DBSI MRI metrics to describe measures of neuroinflammation, myelin and axons in different MS subtypes. Methods: 103 participants (20 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 33 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 30 secondary progressive MS and 20 primary progressive MS) underwent quantitative T1, T2, DBSI and conventional 3T MRI. Whole brain, normal-appearing white matter, lesion and corpus callosum MRI metrics were compared across MS subtypes. Results: A gradation of MRI metric values was seen from CIS to RRMS to progressive MS. RRMS demonstrated large oedema-related differences, while progressive MS had the most extensive abnormalities in myelin and axonal measures. Conclusion: Relaxation and DBSI-derived MRI measures show differences between MS subtypes related to the severity and composition of underlying tissue damage. RRMS showed oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS. Progressive MS had even more evidence of increased oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS and RRMS.",Multiple Sclerosis,journal,['JournalArticle'],8ad5a503-1e51-40ba-abc9-a5ba2920590e,Multiple Sclerosis Journal,418 - 428,28,N/A,2021,2021-06-16 00:00:00,15,42,"I.

A previous study established a scoring system for patients with mild TBI that assigned <3 points for the low-risk group, 3–6 points for the moderate-risk group, and ≥6 points for the high-risk group. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the external validity of mild TBI risk scores for predicting intracranial hemorrhage in patients with mild TBI who had been transferred to receive a brain CT scan at the 10 nationwide CT scan–capable facilities in Thailand. Methods The study was a retrospective cross-sectional review of patients with mild TBI who received a brain CT scan in 10 nationwide hospitals of Thailand. Risk factors were observed and points calculated for predicting mild TBI scores based on patient records. Injured patients were divided into two groups: CT scans indicating normal and abnormal brain images. After this, the accuracy of mild TBI score for predicting the presence of intracranial hemorrhage was investigated. Results The study included a total of 999 patients, comprising 461 (46.15%) patients with abnormal brain CT scans indicating intracranial hemorrhage and 538 (53.85%) indicating no intracranial hemorrhage. In the low-risk group (mild TBI risk score <3), moderate-risk group (mild TBI risk score 3–6), and high-risk group (mild TBI risk score >6), the likelihood ratio positive of brain CT scans were 0.41, 3.53, and 77.3, respectively. Discussion Mild TBI risk score may assist healthcare providers to select patients with mild TBI for brain CT scan referral, particularly in hospitals without CT scan facilities.

Today’s big data processing systems, such as Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Hive, treat big data applications as a batch of jobs for scheduling. Existing schedulers in production systems often maintain fair allocation without considering application performance and resource utilization simultaneously. It is challenging to perform job scheduling in big data systems to achieve both low turnaround time and high resource utilization due to the high complexity in data processing logics and the dynamic variation in workloads. In this article, we propose a performance-aware scheduler, referred to as PAS, which dynamically schedules big data jobs in Hadoop YARN and Spark and autonomously adjusts scheduling policies to improve application performance and resource utilization. Specifically, PAS schedules multiple concurrent jobs using different policies based on the predicted job completion time and employs a greedy approach and a one-step lookahead strategy to opportunistically maximize the average job performance while still maintaining a satisfactory level of resource utilization. We implement PAS in Hadoop YARN and evaluate its performance with HiBench, a well-known big data processing benchmark. Experimental results show that PAS reduces the average turnaround time by 25% and the makespan by 15% in comparison with four state-of-the-art schedulers.",Security and Communication Networks,journal,,02a4454a-84c8-471c-9b40-cc045d4f3223,Security and Communication Networks,,,N/A,2022,2022-04-12 00:00:00,5,44,"Yiren Li, Tieke Li, Pei Shen, Liang Hao, Jin Yang, Zhengtong Zhang, Junhao Chen, Liang Bao","2111149533, 1778777, 2149290130, 2162376257, 2157358539, 2162412589, 2115267766, 2103958254",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd131d2937b46e2790ff67241886e8be9efcce38,"Computer Science, Engineering",2111149533

In recent years, attention has increasingly been paid to human resources (HR), since worker quality and skills represent a growth factor and a real competitive advantage for companies. After having been introduced to sales and marketing departments, artificial intelligence is also starting to guide employee-related decisions within HR management. The purpose is to support decisions that are based not on subjective aspects but on objective data analysis. The goal of this work is to analyse how objective factors influence employee attrition, in order to identify the main causes that contribute to a worker’s decision to leave a company, and to be able to predict whether a particular employee will leave the company. After the training, the obtained model for the prediction of employees’ attrition is tested on a real dataset provided by IBM analytics, which includes 35 features and about 1500 samples. Results are expressed in terms of classical metrics and the algorithm that produced the best results for the available dataset is the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. It reveals the best recall rate (0.54), since it measures the ability of a classifier to find all the positive instances and achieves an overall false negative rate equal to 4.5% of the total observations.",De Computis,,['JournalArticle'],38e26272-f1d7-470a-a99f-0b5884c9df6e,Comput.,86,9,Unknown,2020,2020-11-03 00:00:00,132,40,"Francesca Fallucchi, Marco Coladangelo, R.

Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black‐box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use‐case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system",WIREs Data Mining Knowl.

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder‐Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,conference,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",41bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,,1724-1734,,201441bf9ed3-85b3-4c90-b015-150e31690253,2014,2014-06-03 00:00:00,22595,33,"Kyunghyun Cho, B.

Key challenges include how to shorten transmission delays and increase the stability of transmissions. When establishing routing paths, most research focuses on detecting traffic and selecting roads with higher vehicle densities in order to transmit packets, thus avoiding carry-and-forward scenarios and decreasing transmission delays; however, such approaches may not obtain accurate real-time traffic densities by periodically monitoring each road because vehicle densities change so rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel routing information system called the machine learning-assisted route selection (MARS) system to estimate necessary information for routing protocols. In MARS, road information is maintained in roadside units with the help of machine learning. We use machine learning to predict the moves of vehicles and then choose some suitable routing paths with better transmission capacity to transmit packets. Further, MARS can help to decide the forwarding direction between two RSUs according to the predicted location of the destination and the estimated transmission delays in both forwarding directions. Our proposed system can provide in-time routing information for VANETs and greatly enhance network performance.",Int. J. Distributed Sens.

This study was conducted to compare the differences of sleep disorders in vestibular migraine (VM) patients and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patients. Methods: VM patients, BPPV patients, and healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Pittsburgh sleep quality index and polysomnography monitoring were used as subjective and objective, respectively, evaluation methods to evaluate the sleep quality of participants in the latest month. Results: Fifty-seven BPPV patients, 48 VM patients, and 42 HCs were included in this study. There were 79.16% VM patients, 54.39% BPPV patients, and 14.28% HCs with sleep disorders. The difference in the incidence rate of sleep disorders was significant between VM patients and BPPV patients (p = 0.008) and significantly higher in both the VM group (p < 0.00001) and BPPV group (p = 0.00004) than in the HC groups (14.28%). Compared with BPPV patients, the VM patients had the significantly lower sleep efficiency (p < 0.001) and N3 (p < 0.001) and the significantly higher time of wake-up after sleep onset (p < 0.001), N1 (p < 0.001), and N2 (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the VM patients had significantly higher incidence rates of severe obstructive sleep apnea hypoventilation syndrome (p = 0.001) and periodic leg movement in sleep (p = 0.016). Conclusion: The incidence rate of sleep disorders was significantly higher in both VM and BPPV patients than in the HC groups. To improve the curative effects, clinicians should pay more attention to the comorbidity of sleep disorders in treating VM and BPPV.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,journal,['JournalArticle'],07931092-9002-4e9f-a62d-00af30be540f,Frontiers in Psychiatry,,12,N/A,2021,2021-11-18 00:00:00,13,54,"Hui Xue, Baojun Wang, Tianyu Meng, Shijun Zhao, Qingyin Wang, Xin Zhang, Min-Sung Kang, Wen-ping Xiang","2053313222, 2156645062, 151234498, 2110773073, 2142378459, 2149172322, 2111622351, 1786324",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a4edf0c77f3c41910a8269abaa805a517cfc5b6,Medicine,2053313222

To this end, we build base-ml, a comprehensive MVA/ML software tool, and applied it to three increasingly difficult clinical objectives in differentiation of common vestibular disorders, using data from a large prospective clinical patient registry (DizzyReg). Methods: Base-ml features a full MVA/ML pipeline for classification of multimodal patient data, comprising tools for data loading and pre-processing; a stringent scheme for nested and stratified cross-validation including hyper-parameter optimization; a set of 11 classifiers, ranging from commonly used algorithms like logistic regression and random forests, to artificial neural network models, including a graph-based deep learning model which we recently proposed; a multi-faceted evaluation of classification metrics; tools from the domain of “Explainable AI” that illustrate the input distribution and a statistical analysis of the most important features identified by multiple classifiers. Results: In the first clinical task, classification of the bilateral vestibular failure (N = 66) vs. functional dizziness (N = 346) was possible with a classification accuracy ranging up to 92.5% (Random Forest). In the second task, primary functional dizziness (N = 151) vs. secondary functional dizziness (following an organic vestibular syndrome) (N = 204), was classifiable with an accuracy ranging from 56.5 to 64.2% (k-nearest neighbors/logistic regression). The third task compared four episodic disorders, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (N = 134), vestibular paroxysmia (N = 49), Menière disease (N = 142) and vestibular migraine (N = 215). Classification accuracy ranged between 25.9 and 50.4% (Naïve Bayes/Support Vector Machine). Recent (graph-) deep learning models classified well in all three tasks, but not significantly better than more traditional ML methods. Classifiers reliably identified clinically relevant features as most important toward classification. Conclusion: The three clinical tasks yielded classification results that correlate with the clinical intuition regarding the difficulty of diagnosis.

In the presence of complex diagnostic information, automated systems can support human decision making. Recent developments in machine learning might facilitate bedside diagnosis of VM and MD. Methods Data of this study originate from the prospective patient registry of the German Centre for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, a specialized tertiary treatment center at the University Hospital Munich. The classification task was to differentiate cases of VM, MD from other vestibular disease entities. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) were used for classification. Results A total of 1357 patients were included (mean age 52.9, SD 15.9, 54.7% female), 9.9% with MD and 15.6% with VM. DNN models yielded an accuracy of 98.4 ± 0.5%, a precision of 96.3 ± 3.9%, and a sensitivity of 85.4 ± 3.9% for VM, and an accuracy of 98.0 ± 1.0%, a precision of 90.4 ± 6.2% and a sensitivity of 89.9 ± 4.6% for MD. BDT yielded an accuracy of 84.5 ± 0.5%, precision of 51.8 ± 6.1%, sensitivity of 16.9 ± 1.7% for VM, and an accuracy of 93.3 ± 0.7%, precision 76.0 ± 6.7%, sensitivity 41.7 ± 2.9% for MD.

Intrinsic variability between cells, caused by manufacturing differences, occurs at all stages of life and increases with age. Researchers need to know the minimum number of cells they should test to give an accurate representation of population variability, since testing many cells is expensive. In this paper, empirical capacity versus time ageing models were fitted to various degradation datasets assuming that the model parameters could be drawn from a distribution describing a larger population. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we estimated the number of cells required to be tested. Depending on the complexity of the ageing model, models with 1, 2 or 3 parameters respectively required data from at least 9, 11 or 13 cells for a consistent fit. This implies that researchers will need to test at least these numbers of cells at each test point in their experiment to capture manufacturing variability.",Batteries & Supercaps,,,008fc754-9ac0-4397-a17a-0c1601b6f913,Batteries & Supercaps,,,Unknown,2021,2021-07-04 00:00:00,21,45,"Philipp Dechent, Samuel Greenbank, Felix Hildenbrand, Saad Jbabdi, Dirk Uwe Sauer, D.

An analysis of English road fatality data, incorporating gender and road type","Background Most analysis of road injuries examines the risk experienced by people using different modes of transport, for instance, pedestrian fatalities per-head or per-km. A small but growing field analyses the impact that the use of different transport modes has on other road users, for instance, injuries to others per-km driven. Methods This paper moves the analysis of risk posed to others forward by comparing six different vehicular modes, separating road types (major vs minor roads in urban vs rural settings). The comparison of risk posed by men and women for all these modes is also novel. Results Per-vehicle kilometre, buses and lorries pose much the highest risk to others, while cycles pose the lowest. Motorcycles pose a substantially higher per-km risk to others than cars. The fatality risk posed by cars or vans to ORUs per km is higher in rural areas. Risk posed is generally higher on major roads, although not in the case of lorries, suggesting a link to higher speeds. Men pose higher per-km risk to others than women for all modes except buses, as well as being over-represented among users of the most dangerous vehicles. Conclusions Future research should examine more settings, adjust for spatial and temporal confounders, or examine how infrastructure or route characteristics affect risk posed to others. Although for most victims the other vehicle involved is a car, results suggest policy-makers should also seek to reduce disproportionate risks posed by the more dangerous vehicles, for instance, by discouraging motorcycling. Finally, given higher risk posed to others by men across five of six modes analysed, policy-makers should consider how to reduce persistent large gender imbalances in jobs involving driving.",Injury Prevention,journal,['JournalArticle'],dc811d66-51f0-49c7-a652-62e4da8433a3,Injury Prevention,71 - 76,27,N/A,2020,2020-03-30 00:00:00,20,19,"R.

By analyzing the synergies between gender inequality (as a problem), and lack of sustainability (another problem), there is a potential to create an understanding of how these problems are linked. Our aim is to better understand how gendered norms find expression in transport policy and planning. Taking a starting point in gender studies we advance four ideal types on masculine and feminine norms and relate them to sustainability in transport. We advance a methodology for studying gender norms in relation to sustainability in terms of how they are expressed in the text. We contribute to a deeper understanding of transportation related to men and masculinity studies, and advance work by masculinity scholars to include sustainability in transportation issues. Through text analysis, we demonstrate empirically how four Swedish municipalities have developed their (sustainable) transport policies 2014–2018.

For such applications, it is necessary to connect the batteries in large assemblies of cells in series and parallel. With a large number of cells operating together, it is necessary to understand their intrinsic variabilities, not only at the initial stage but also upon aging. In this study, we studied a batch of commercial cells to address their initial cell-to-cell variations and also the variations induced by cycling. To do so, we not only tracked several metrics associated with cell performance, the maximum capacity, the resistance, and the rate capability but also the degradation mechanism via a non-invasive quantification of the loss of lithium inventory (LLI), the loss of active material (LAM) and the kinetic degradation on both electrodes. We found that, even with small initial cell-to-cell variations, significant variations will be observed upon aging because the cells degrade at a different pace. We also observed that these variations were not correlated with the initial variations.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Energies,1031,11,Unknown,2018,2018-04-24 00:00:00,90,38,"A. Devie, G. Baure, M.

A more precise characterization of the environment will allow a better dealing with genotype-by-environment-by-management interactions. Therefore, space and time dependencies of the crop production processes have to be considered. The use of novel sensor technologies has drastically increased the amount and diversity of phenotypic data from agronomic field trials. Existing data management systems either do not consider space and time, are not customizable to individual needs such as field trial handling, or have restricted availability. Hence, we propose an integrative data management and information system (DMIS) for handling of traditional and novel sensor-based phenotypic, environmental and management data. The DMIS must be customizable, applicable and scalable from individual users to organizations. Key element of the system is a dynamic PostgreSQL database with GIS-extension, capable of importing, storing and managing all types of data including images. The database references every structural database object and measurement in a threefold approach with semantic, spatial and temporal reference. Timestamps and geo-coordinates allow automated linking of all data. Traits can be precisely defined individually or uploaded as predefined lists. Filtering and selection routines allow compilation of all data for visualization via tables, charts or maps and for export and external statistical analysis. New possibilities of environmental information-based planning of field trials, weather-guided phenotyping and data analysis for outlier or hot-spot detection are demonstrated. The DMIS supports users in handling experimental field trials with crop plants and modern phenotyping methods. It focuses on linking all space and time dependent processes of plant production. Weather, soil and management, as well as growth and yield formation of the plants can be depicted, thus allowing a more precise interpretation of the results in relation to environment and management. Breeders, extension specialists, official testing agencies and agricultural scientists are assisted in all steps of a typical workflow with planning, designing, conducting, controlling and analyzing field trials to generate new information for decision support in the crop improvement process.",Plant Methods,journal,['JournalArticle'],7218da31-236c-47af-8931-874dcec1be68,Plant Methods,,16,N/A,2020,2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,44,"A.

Driven by modern deep-learning approaches, RootNav 2.0 replaces previously manual and semi-automatic feature extraction with an extremely deep multi-task Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The network has been designed to explicitly combine local pixel information with global scene information in order to accurately segment small root features across high-resolution images. In addition, the network simultaneously locates seeds, and first and second order root tips to drive a search algorithm seeking optimal paths throughout the image, extracting accurate architectures without user interaction. The proposed method is evaluated on images of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from a seedling assay. The results are compared with semi-automatic analysis via the original RootNav tool, demonstrating comparable accuracy, with a 10-fold increase in speed. We then demonstrate the ability of the network to adapt to different plant species via transfer learning, offering similar accuracy when transferred to an Arabidopsis thaliana plate assay. We transfer for a final time to images of Brassica napus from a hydroponic assay, and still demonstrate good accuracy despite many fewer training images.

Phenotyping roots in soil is often challenging due to the roots being difficult to access and the use of time consuming manual methods. Rhizotrons allow visual inspection of root growth through transparent surfaces. Agronomists currently manually label photographs of roots obtained from rhizotrons using a line-intersect method to obtain root length density and rooting depth measurements which are essential for their experiments. We investigate the effectiveness of an automated image segmentation method based on the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to enable such measurements. We design a data-set of 50 annotated chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) root images which we use to train, validate and test the system and compare against a baseline built using the Frangi vesselness filter. We obtain metrics using manual annotations and line-intersect counts. Our results on the held out data show our proposed automated segmentation system to be a viable solution for detecting and quantifying roots. We evaluate our system using 867 images for which we have obtained line-intersect counts, attaining a Spearman rank correlation of 0.9748 and an r2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$r^2$$\end{document} of 0.9217.

One of the key factors is cloudiness, which can be presented not only as a percentage of the sky area covered by clouds but also many additional parameters, such as the type of clouds, the distribution of clouds across atmospheric layers, and their height. The use of machine learning algorithms to forecast the generation of solar power plants requires retrospective data over a long period and formalising the features; however, retrospective data with detailed information about cloudiness are normally recorded in the natural language format. This paper proposes an algorithm for processing such records to convert them into a binary feature vector. Experiments conducted on data from a real solar power plant showed that this algorithm increases the accuracy of short-term solar irradiance forecasts by 5–15%, depending on the quality metric used. At the same time, adding features makes the model less transparent to the user, which is a significant drawback from the point of view of explainable artificial intelligence. Therefore, the paper uses an additive explanation algorithm based on the Shapley vector to interpret the model’s output. It is shown that this approach allows the machine learning model to explain why it generates a particular forecast, which will provide a greater level of trust in intelligent information systems in the power industry.",Algorithms,journal,['JournalArticle'],e95c8d18-09be-464f-a3cf-5b2637f0eff6,Algorithms,150,17,N/A,2024,2024-04-02 00:00:00,6,31,"P.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop and improve methods for forecasting of the power plants generation using the energy of the sun, wind and water flows. One of the ways to improve the accuracy of forecast models is a deep analysis of meteorological conditions as the main factor affecting the power generation. In this paper, a method for adapting of forecast models to the meteorological conditions of photovoltaic stations operation based on machine learning algorithms was proposed and studied. In this case, unsupervised learning is first performed using the k-means method to form clusters. For this, it is also proposed to use studied the feature space dimensionality reduction algorithm to visualize and estimate the clustering accuracy. Then, for each cluster, its own machine learning model was trained for generation forecasting and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm was built to attribute the current conditions at the model operation stage to one of the formed clusters. The study was conducted on hourly meteorological data for the period from 1985 to 2021. A feature of the approach is the clustering of weather conditions on hourly rather than daily intervals. As a result, the mean absolute percentage error of forecasting is reduced significantly, depending on the prediction model used. For the best case, the error in forecasting of a photovoltaic plant generation an hour ahead was 9 %.",ENERGETIKA.

One such requirement is the installed capacity utilization factor, which is extremely important for optimally placing power facilities based on renewable energy sources and for the successful development of renewable energy. Efficient placement maximizes the installed capacity utilization factor of a power facility, increasing energy efficiency and the payback period. The installed capacity utilization factor depends on the assumed meteorological factors relating to geographical location and the technical characteristics of power generation. However, the installed capacity utilization factor cannot be accurately predicted, since it is necessary to know the volume of electricity produced by the power facility. A novel approach to the optimization of placement of renewable energy source power plants and their capacity factor forecasting was proposed in this article. This approach combines a machine learning forecasting algorithm (random forest regressor) with a metaheuristic optimization algorithm (grey wolf optimizer). Although the proposed approach assumes the use of only open-source data, the simulations show better results than commonly used algorithms, such as random search, particle swarm optimizer, and firefly algorithm.",Mathematics,,['JournalArticle'],6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,5,44,"A.

In this circumstance, there has been a large number of energy-related international investment studies. However, the existing academic literature lacks a systematic scientometric analysis of this research topic, so this paper will fill this gap. Using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and HisCite, this paper analyzes 1014 articles published in the WoS SSCI Collection from January 1998 to March 2022 on the energy-related international investment. This paper comprehensively analyzes this field from four evolutionary dimensions. In the discipline and mainstream journals dimension, the largest change lies in the fact that more than three different disciplines flow into mathematics, while the journal “Environmental Science and Pollution Research” shows a dramatic growth in relevant publications after 2015. Keyword evolution shows a gradual deepening emphasis from attracting energy-related international investment to systematically analyzing the influencing mechanisms of the international investment-energy-environmental quality nexus.

A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect aberrant traffic behavior that firewalls cannot detect. In IDSs, dimension reduction using the feature selection strategy has been shown to be more efficient. By reducing the data dimension and eliminating irrelevant and noisy data, several bio-inspired algorithms have been employed to improve the performance of an IDS. This paper discusses a modified bio-inspired algorithm, which is the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), that enhances the efficacy of the IDS in detecting both normal and anomalous traffic in the network. The main improvements cover the smart initialization phase that combines the filter and wrapper approaches to ensure that the informative features will be included in early iterations. In addition, we adopted a high-speed classification method, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and used the modified GWO to tune the ELM’s parameters. The proposed technique was tested against various meta-heuristic algorithms using the UNSWNB-15 dataset. Because the generic attack is the most common attack type in the dataset, the primary goal of this paper was to detect generic attacks in network traffic. The proposed model outperformed other methods in minimizing the crossover error rate and false positive rate to less than 30%. Furthermore, it obtained the best results with 81%, 78%, and 84% for the accuracy, F1-score, and G-mean measures, respectively.",Mathematics,,,6175efe8-6f8e-4cbe-8cee-d154f4e78627,Mathematics,,,Unknown,2022,2022-03-21 00:00:00,72,62,"Abdullah Alzaqebah, Ibrahim Aljarah, Omar Sultan Al-Kadi, R.

Because of the shortcomings of traditional common machine learning algorithms in network intrusion detection, such as insufficient accuracy, a network intrusion detection system based on LightGBM and autoencoder (AE) is proposed. The LightGBM-AE model proposed in this paper includes three steps: data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The LightGBM-AE model adopts the LightGBM algorithm for feature selection, and then uses an autoencoder for training and detection. When a set of data containing network intrusion behaviors are inputted into an autoencoder, there is a large reconstruction error between the original input data and the reconstructed data obtained by the autoencoder, which provides a basis for intrusion detection. According to the reconstruction error, an appropriate threshold is set to distinguish symmetrically between normal behavior and attack behavior. The experiment is carried out on the NSL-KDD dataset and implemented using Pytorch. In addition to autoencoder, variational autoencoder (VAE) and denoising autoencoder (DAE) are also used for intrusion detection and are compared with existing machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, GBDT, and XGBoost. The evaluation is carried out through classification evaluation indexes such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. The experimental results show that the method can efficiently separate the attack behavior from normal behavior according to the reconstruction error. Compared with other methods, the effectiveness and superiority of this method are verified.",Symmetry,journal,['JournalArticle'],1620da87-4387-4b9a-9bf4-22fdf74d4dc3,Symmetry,1458,12,N/A,2020,2020-09-04 00:00:00,47,31,"Chaofei Tang, Nurbol Luktarhan, Yuxin Zhao","80825310, 3123725, 2109933437",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0df8a938848c989a6eb48b18c2546021b8299a3e,"Computer Science, Engineering",80825310

Most of the research is based on manually extracted features, but this approach not only requires a lot of labor costs but also loses a lot of information in the original data, resulting in low judgment accuracy and cannot be deployed in actual situations. This paper develops a DL-IDS (deep learning-based intrusion detection system), which uses the hybrid network of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) to extract the spatial and temporal features of network traffic data and to provide a better intrusion detection system. To reduce the influence of an unbalanced number of samples of different attack types in model training samples on model performance, DL-IDS used a category weight optimization method to improve the robustness. Finally, DL-IDS is tested on CICIDS2017, a reliable intrusion detection dataset that covers all the common, updated intrusions and cyberattacks. In the multiclassification test, DL-IDS reached 98.67% in overall accuracy, and the accuracy of each attack type was above 99.50%.",Secur. Commun. Networks,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Secur.

Existing detection systems are continually outmaneuvered by the relentless advancement of botnet strategies, necessitating a more dynamic and proactive approach. Our research introduces a ground-breaking solution to the persistent botnet problem through a strategic amalgamation of Hybrid Feature Selection methods—Categorical Analysis, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis—and a robust ensemble of machine learning techniques. We uniquely combine these feature selection tools to refine the input space, enhancing the detection capabilities of the ensemble learners. Extra Trees, as the ensemble technique of choice, exhibits exemplary performance, culminating in a near-perfect 99.99% accuracy rate in botnet classification across varied datasets. Our model not only surpasses previous benchmarks but also demonstrates exceptional adaptability to new botnet phenomena, ensuring persistent accuracy in a landscape of evolving threats. Detailed comparative analyses manifest our model's superiority, consistently achieving over 99% True Positive Rates and an unprecedented False Positive Rate close to 0.00%, thereby setting a new precedent for reliability in botnet detection. This research signifies a transformative step in cybersecurity, offering unprecedented precision and resilience against botnet infiltrations, and providing an indispensable blueprint for the development of next-generation security frameworks.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,13,N/A,2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,25,84,"Md.

Contributing factors are elements in the healthcare process (eg, communication failures) that instigate an event or allow an event to occur. Contributing factors can be used to further investigate why safety events occurred. Methods We used 10 years of self-reported PSE reports from a multihospital healthcare system in the USA. Reports were first selected by event date. We calculated χ2 values for each ngram in the bag-of-words then selected N ngrams with the highest χ2 values. Then, PSE reports were filtered to only include the sentences containing the selected ngrams. Such sentences were called information-rich sentences. We compared two feature extraction techniques from free-text data: (1) baseline bag-of-words features and (2) features from information-rich sentences. Three machine learning algorithms were used to categorise five contributing factors representing sociotechnical errors: communication/hand-off failure, technology issue, policy/procedure issue, distractions/interruptions and lapse/slip. We trained 15 binary classifiers (five contributing factors * three machine learning models). The models’ performances were evaluated according to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), precision, recall, and F1-score. Results Applying the information-rich sentence selection algorithm boosted the contributing factor categorisation performance. Comparing the AUPRCs, the proposed NLP approach improved the categorisation performance of two and achieved comparable results with baseline in categorising three contributing factors. Conclusions Information-rich sentence selection can be incorporated to extract the sentences in free-text event narratives in which the contributing factor information is embedded.",BMJ Health & Care Informatics,journal,['JournalArticle'],88b9565b-577a-44e3-b26e-84ad5f1598a2,BMJ Health & Care Informatics,,30,N/A,2023,2023-05-01 00:00:00,7,41,"A.

d0e262c94a0415fda724aa91d6f60c627ddd0519,10.2196/43014,Extracting Medical Information From Free-Text and Unstructured Patient-Generated Health Data Using Natural Language Processing Methods: Feasibility Study With Real-world Data,"Background Patient-generated health data (PGHD) captured via smart devices or digital health technologies can reflect an individual health journey. PGHD enables tracking and monitoring of personal health conditions, symptoms, and medications out of the clinic, which is crucial for self-care and shared clinical decisions. In addition to self-reported measures and structured PGHD (eg, self-screening, sensor-based biometric data), free-text and unstructured PGHD (eg, patient care note, medical diary) can provide a broader view of a patient’s journey and health condition. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process and analyze unstructured data to create meaningful summaries and insights, showing promise to improve the utilization of PGHD. Objective Our aim is to understand and demonstrate the feasibility of an NLP pipeline to extract medication and symptom information from real-world patient and caregiver data. Methods We report a secondary data analysis, using a data set collected from 24 parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who were recruited via a nonrandom sampling approach. Participants used a voice-interactive app for 2 weeks, generating free-text patient notes (audio transcription or text entry). We built an NLP pipeline using a zero-shot approach (adaptive to low-resource settings). We used named entity recognition (NER) and medical ontologies (RXNorm and SNOMED CT [Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms]) to identify medication and symptoms. Sentence-level dependency parse trees and part-of-speech tags were used to extract additional entity information using the syntactic properties of a note. We assessed the data; evaluated the pipeline with the patient notes; and reported the precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results In total, 87 patient notes are included (audio transcriptions n=78 and text entries n=9) from 24 parents who have at least one CSHCN. The participants were between the ages of 26 and 59 years. The majority were White (n=22, 92%), had more than one child (n=16, 67%), lived in Ohio (n=22, 92%), had mid- or upper-mid household income (n=15, 62.5%), and had higher level education (n=24, 58%). Out of 87 notes, 30 were drug and medication related, and 46 were symptom related. We captured medication instances (medication, unit, quantity, and date) and symptoms satisfactorily (precision >0.65, recall >0.77, F1>0.72). These results indicate the potential when using NER and dependency parsing through an NLP pipeline on information extraction from unstructured PGHD. Conclusions The proposed NLP pipeline was found to be feasible for use with real-world unstructured PGHD to accomplish medication and symptom extraction. Unstructured PGHD can be leveraged to inform clinical decision-making, remote monitoring, and self-care including medical adherence and chronic disease management. With customizable information extraction methods using NER and medical ontologies, NLP models can feasibly extract a broad range of clinical information from unstructured PGHD in low-resource settings (eg, a limited number of patient notes or training data).",JMIR Formative Research,,['JournalArticle'],6c3e705d-29b5-462c-9a3a-6c7877b74a18,JMIR Formative Research,,7,Unknown,2022,2022-09-27 00:00:00,23,52,"Emre Sezgin, Syed-Amad A.

The National Academy of Medicine recognizes diagnostic errors, defined as “the failure to establish an accurate and timely explanation of a patient’s health problem(s) or to communicate that explanation to the patient,”1 as a major health care issue. Diagnostic errors include delayed diagnoses, wrong diagnoses, and missed diagnoses. Despite the personal and societal consequences of diagnostic errors, they are often unrecognized and unaddressed in patient safety and in health care quality metrics and guidelines. The association between diagnostic errors and health care disparities has received even less attention to date. Disparities in health care access and outcomes by race and ethnicity, sex, gender, geographic location, and socioeconomic status are well documented and persistent. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed and been associated with increasing these deep-seated disparities in health and health care in the US.2 Even before the pandemic, in 2011, US health care disparities were estimated to cost $309 billion annually.3 Few studies have examined the association between diagnostic errors and health care disparities. One study suggested the potential for misdiagnosis based on the results of genetic testing when using diagnostic tools that were developed with less diverse patient populations.4 Another study indicated that Black patients are more likely than White patients to be underdiagnosed with depression during their first primary care visit for mental health needs.5 Similarly, Black children are less likely to be diagnosed with otitis media compared with White children with similar presentations.6 This limited evidence for diagnostic disparities most likely reflects a dearth of research rather than an absence of disparities. Diagnostic errors and disparities, twin challenges in health care, can and should be addressed by implementing research and quality improvement initiatives, policy and payment reform, and technology and by educating clinicians about the importance of evidence-based use of diagnostic tools and the contributions of social determinants of health to disparities in care. The proliferation of big data and associated artificial intelligence (AI) methods provides yet another avenue to address these challenges. For example, computer decision support has been associated with reduced inequities in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis,7 likely by reducing implicit bias. The health care industry is emerging as a leader in the adoption of AI through sophisticated machine learning– assisted diagnostic tools. For clinical trials, AI has the potential to support every stage of the process, including finding a trial in which to enroll, addressing patient-centric enrollment issues, and assessing trial medication adherence with remote and digital monitoring. It is equally important to tap into the opportunities provided by big data and AI to detect and address diagnostic disparities in populations at risk for such disparities. In a recent study, machine learning was used to develop a new algorithm to measure the severity of knee osteoarthritis based on existing radiologic data.8 With use of the well-established standard Kellgren-Lawrence grading system to classify osteoarthritis, Black patients had more severe osteoarthritis than did White patients. However, adjustment for Kellgren-Lawrence grading scores did not reduce or eliminate racial differences in patient-reported knee pain. Applying an AI-driven algorithmic measure markedly improved the predictive performance of the measure and reduced the racial disparity in patient-reported pain.8 Unlike the standard severity measure, which was developed Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.",JAMA Health Forum,journal,['JournalArticle'],424be4c6-0550-4f1d-91ca-08f8ef523c47,JAMA health forum,"

One potential limitation of LDCT screening is overdiagnosis of slow growing and indolent cancers. In this study, peritumoral and intratumoral radiomics was used to identify a vulnerable subset of lung patients associated with poor survival outcomes. Incident lung cancer patients from the NLST were split into training and test cohorts and an external cohort of non-screen detected adenocarcinomas was used for further validation. After removing redundant and non-reproducible radiomics features, backward elimination analyses identified a single model which was subjected to Classification and Regression Tree to stratify patients into three risk-groups based on two radiomics features (NGTDM Busyness and Statistical Root Mean Square [RMS]). The final model was validated in the test cohort and the cohort of non-screen detected adenocarcinomas. Using a radio-genomics dataset, Statistical RMS was significantly associated with FOXF2 gene by both correlation and two-group analyses. Our rigorous approach generated a novel radiomics model that identified a vulnerable high-risk group of early stage patients associated with poor outcomes. These patients may require aggressive follow-up and/or adjuvant therapy to mitigate their poor outcomes.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,10,N/A,2020,2020-06-29 00:00:00,55,54,"J.

Here we report the design of a series of inositol phosphate analogs as crystallization inhibitors, among which 4,6-di-O-(methoxy-diethyleneglycol)-myo-inositol-1,2,3,5-tetrakis(phosphate), (OEG2)2-IP4, displays increased in vitro activity, as well as more favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles than IP6 after subcutaneous injection. (OEG2)2-IP4 potently stabilizes calciprotein particle (CPP) growth, consistently demonstrates low micromolar activity in different in vitro models of VC (i.e., human serum, primary cell cultures, and tissue explants), and largely abolishes the development of VC in rodent models, while not causing toxicity related to serum calcium chelation. The data suggest a mechanism of action independent of the etiology of VC, whereby (OEG2)2-IP4 disrupts the nucleation and growth of pathological calcification. Cardiovascular calcification is a serious pathology for which effective pharmacological treatments are lacking.

In the 2019 update, WebGestalt supports 12 organisms, 342 gene identifiers and 155 175 functional categories, as well as user-uploaded functional databases. To address the growing and unique need for phosphoproteomics data interpretation, we have implemented phosphosite set analysis to identify important kinases from phosphoproteomics data. We have completely redesigned result visualizations and user interfaces to improve user-friendliness and to provide multiple types of interactive and publication-ready figures. To facilitate comprehension of the enrichment results, we have implemented two methods to reduce redundancy between enriched gene sets. We introduced a web API for other applications to get data programmatically from the WebGestalt server or pass data to WebGestalt for analysis. We also wrapped the core computation into an R package called WebGestaltR for users to perform analysis locally or in third party workflows.

SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D3-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D3-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.",PLoS ONE,journal,['JournalArticle'],0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b,PLoS ONE,,13,N/A,2018,2018-05-09 00:00:00,41,46,"M.

It is however, not been possible to separate the renal consequences of hyperoxaluria from that of CaOx crystal deposition. We decided to utilize ethylene glycol (EG) model where hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal deposition can be separated in time. To test our hypothesis, male rats were made hyperoxaluric by administering EG, rats were euthanized and kidneys were extracted on day 14, when occasional crystal is seen in the kidneys and day 28, when all animals have developed renal CaOx crystal deposits. Total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis and genome wide analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed to investigate differences between hyperoxaluria and crystal induced alterations in the kidneys. Immunohistochemical and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was also done for macromolecules with significant role in stone formation. All EG fed rats became hyperoxaluric by day 7, showed a few crystal deposits on day 14, and had heavy crystal deposition by day 28. There were significant changes in the expression of genes encoding for NADPH Oxidases; macromolecular crystallization modulators; genes involved in inflammasome activation; and osteogenic marker genes. Results demonstrate major differences between hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal induced changes in the kidneys.

Indeed, the effective and efficient application of data mining methods entail many decisions, ranging from how to define student’s success , through which student attributes to focus on , up to which machine learning method is more appropriate to the given problem . This study aims to provide a step-by-step set of guidelines for educators willing to apply data mining techniques to predict student success.

The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university’s strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching–learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching–learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student’s performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students.",Sustainability,journal,,8775599f-4f9a-45f0-900e-7f4de68e6843,Sustainability,,,N/A,2019,2019-05-17 00:00:00,100,35,"Diego Buenaño-Fernández, David Gil, Sergio Luján-Mora","1397315428, 2060055063, 1405522947",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c0d8c7b571530613aae37dc863b9ed34c13e95b,"Computer Science, Education, Engineering",1397315428

More than 60–80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases can be attributed to HBV infection in high HBV prevalent regions. Although traditional Sanger sequencing has been extensively used to investigate HBV sequences, NGS is becoming more commonly used. Further, it is unknown whether word pattern frequencies of HBV reads by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used to investigate HBV genotypes and predict HCC status. In this study, we used NGS to sequence the pre-S region of the HBV sequence of 94 HCC patients and 45 chronic HBV (CHB) infected individuals. Word pattern frequencies among the sequence data of all individuals were calculated and compared using the Manhattan distance. The individuals were grouped using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Word pattern frequencies were also used to build prediction models for HCC status using both K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). We showed the extremely high power of analyzing HBV sequences using word patterns. Our key findings include that the first principal coordinate of the PCoA analysis was highly associated with the fraction of genotype B (or C) sequences and the second principal coordinate was significantly associated with the probability of having HCC. Hierarchical clustering first groups the individuals according to their major genotypes followed by their HCC status. Using cross-validation, high area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) of around 0.88 for KNN and 0.92 for SVM were obtained. In the independent data set of 46 HCC patients and 31 CHB individuals, a good AUC score of 0.77 was obtained using SVM. It was further shown that 3000 reads for each individual can yield stable prediction results for SVM. Thus, another key finding is that word patterns can be used to predict HCC status with high accuracy. Therefore, our study shows clearly that word pattern frequencies of HBV sequences contain much information about the composition of different HBV genotypes and the HCC status of an individual.",PLoS Genetics,journal,['JournalArticle'],22203759-0bc9-4429-8b67-4140ab209cef,PLoS Genetics,,14,N/A,2018,2018-02-01 00:00:00,14,55,"Xin Bai, Jian-an Jia, M.

In order to assess the relative contribution of HBV and HCV to HCC worldwide, and identify changes over time, we conducted a systematic review of case series published up to the year 2014. Eligible studies had to report seroprevalence of both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti‐HCV), alone and in combination, for at least 20 adult HCC cases. Studies using a first‐generation enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay test for HCV were excluded. A total of 119,000 HCC cases in 260 studies were included from 50 countries. Most European and American countries show a preponderance of HCV over HBV and a substantial fraction of viral marker–negative cases. Asian and African countries generally show a predominance of HBV. The fraction of HCV‐positive HCC cases is substantial in Taiwan, Mongolia, Japan, and Pakistan as well as in Western‐Central Asia and Northern Africa. No eligible studies were available in Oceania, large parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. The United States, Brazil, and Germany show evidence of higher prevalence of HCV in HCC since the year 2000. Conversely, Japan and Italy show a decline in the proportion of HCV‐positive HCC. Conclusion: HBV and HCV are predominant causes of HCC in virtually all world areas, with a growing fraction of HCC cases in several countries attributable to HCV.

However, it cannot yet replace Sanger sequencing (SS) in diagnostics because of incomplete representation and coverage of exons leading to missing clinically relevant mutations. Targeted next‐generation sequencing (NGS), in which a selected fraction of genes is sequenced, may circumvent these shortcomings. We aimed to determine whether the sensitivity and specificity of targeted NGS is equal to those of SS. We constructed a targeted enrichment kit that includes 48 genes associated with hereditary cardiomyopathies. In total, 84 individuals with cardiomyopathies were sequenced using 151 bp paired‐end reads on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The reproducibility was tested by repeating the entire procedure for five patients. The coverage of ≥30 reads per nucleotide, our major quality criterion, was 99% and in total ∼21,000 variants were identified. Confirmation with SS was performed for 168 variants (155 substitutions, 13 indels). All were confirmed, including a deletion of 18 bp and an insertion of 6 bp. The reproducibility was nearly 100%. We demonstrate that targeted NGS of a disease‐specific subset of genes is equal to the quality of SS and it can therefore be reliably implemented as a stand‐alone diagnostic test.",Human Mutation,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Study']",b51ebc17-99ea-48ba-9271-1074f526a9a1,Human Mutation,,34,N/A,2013,2013-07-01 00:00:00,291,22,"B.

The etiopathogenesis of this condition is idiopathic. There are different predisposing factors in the literature which are consistent with the presented case such as lack of anterior prominence of the disc, thinning of the posterior zone of the disc and perforation of the disc. Patient Concerns: We report an uncommon temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthropathy case of a 33-year-old female patient, who presented with long-standing TMJ pain associated with limited mouth opening. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with non-reducible PDD of TMJ bilaterally. Treatment: Open surgery of TMJ (Discopexy) was the choice of treatment to release and mobilise discs. Outcomes: A noticeable increase in mouth opening without pain in TMJ area was achieved immediately after surgery and remained stable during periodic follow-ups. Take-away Lessons: The importance of magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool for arthropathy, to determine the proper management is essential. Moreover, the root of the helix inter tragus notch incision presents an advantage of open surgery of TMJ which results in immediate outcome with limited complications.",Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'CaseReport']",1820b43c-9da0-4721-8fbf-b23cc432fd9c,Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery,81 - 84,14,N/A,2024,2024-03-20 00:00:00,1,11,"Ahmad Gh Alkandari, K.

Sagittal MRI images of 2520 TMJs were collected from 861 men and 399 women (average age 37.33 ± 18.83 years). A deep learning algorithm with a convolutional neural network was developed. Data augmentation and the Adam optimizer were applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the deep-learning model. The prediction performances were compared between the models and human experts based on areas under the curve (AUCs). The fine-tuning model showed excellent prediction performance (AUC = 0.8775) and acceptable accuracy (approximately 77%). Comparing the AUC values of the from-scratch (0.8269) and freeze models (0.5858) showed lower performances of the other models compared to the fine-tuning model. In Grad-CAM visualizations, the fine-tuning scheme focused more on the TMJ disc when judging ADD, and the sparsity was higher than that of the from-scratch scheme (84.69% vs. 55.61%, p < 0.05). The three fine-tuned ensemble models using different data augmentation techniques showed a prediction accuracy of 83%. Moreover, the AUC values of ADD were higher when patients with TMD were divided by age (0.8549–0.9275) and sex (male: 0.8483, female: 0.9276). While the accuracy of the ensemble model was higher than that of human experts, the difference was not significant (p = 0.1987–0.0671). Learning from pre-trained weights allowed the fine-tuning model to outperform the from-scratch model. Another benefit of the fine-tuning model for diagnosing ADD of TMJ in Grad-CAM analysis was the deactivation of unwanted gradient values to provide clearer visualizations compared to the from-scratch model. The Grad-CAM visualizations also agreed with the model learned through important features in the joint disc area. The accuracy was further improved by an ensemble of three fine-tuning models using diversified data. The main benefits of this model were the higher specificity compared to human experts, which may be useful for preventing true negative cases, and the maintenance of its prediction accuracy across sexes and ages, suggesting a generalized prediction.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,N/A,2022,2022-07-05 00:00:00,30,51,"Yeon-Hee Lee, J.

The most important subgroup of articular abnormalities in patients with temporomandibular disorders includes patients with different forms of articular disc displacement and deformation. Here, we propose a fully automated articular disc detection and segmentation system to support the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder on magnetic resonance imaging. This system uses deep learning-based semantic segmentation approaches. The study included a total of 217 magnetic resonance images from 10 patients with anterior displacement of the articular disc and 10 healthy control subjects with normal articular discs. These images were used to evaluate three deep learning-based semantic segmentation approaches: our proposed convolutional neural network encoder-decoder named 3DiscNet (Detection for Displaced articular DISC using convolutional neural NETwork), U-Net, and SegNet-Basic. Of the three algorithms, 3DiscNet and SegNet-Basic showed comparably good metrics (Dice coefficient, sensitivity, and positive predictive value). This study provides a proof-of-concept for a fully automated deep learning-based segmentation methodology for articular discs on magnetic resonance images, and obtained promising initial results, indicating that the method could potentially be used in clinical practice for the assessment of temporomandibular disorders.",Scientific Reports,journal,['JournalArticle'],f99f77b7-b1b6-44d3-984a-f288e9884b9b,Scientific Reports,,12,N/A,2022,2022-01-07 00:00:00,25,37,"S.

The present study investigated the effects of ultrasonic excitation on the heat transfer rate in a fin-and-flat tube heat exchanger experimentally. The performance of the heat exchanger was investigated with and without the presence of ultrasonic excitation. A comprehensive parameter study was attempted, so several parameters, including ambient temperature, flow rate, air passing velocity, Reynolds number, and Nusselt number, were studied in a relatively wide range. An adequate uncertainty test, as well as a validation assessment, is provided to certify the credibility of the obtained results and the hired facility. The results revealed that reducing the flow rate, ambient temperature, and air passing velocity on the heat exchanger increased the ultrasonic excitation’s effects. The highest heat transfer enhancement in the present experiment was 70.11%, measured at the lowest air passing velocity and ambient temperature with a Reynolds number 2166. The data presented in this paper will be useful for the optimal design of ultrasonic vibrating fin-and-tube heat exchangers.",Fire,conference,,a33b4339-8ebd-427d-8a4a-2496fca85732,Fire,,,2022a33b4339-8ebd-427d-8a4a-2496fca85732,2022,2022-12-31 00:00:00,40,28,"A.

However, almost all additively manufactured parts must be post-processed in order to fulfil geometric tolerances, surface quality demands and the desired functional properties. Thus, additive manufacturing actually means the implementation of additive-subtractive process chains. Starting with the most relevant additive processes (powder-based PBF-LB, LMD-p and wire-based WAAM and LMD-w/WLAM), considering intermediate process steps (heat treatment and shot peening) and ending up with post-processing material removal processes (with defined and undefined cutting edges), this paper gives an overview of recent research findings with respect to a comprehensive scientific investigation of influences and interactions within the additive-subtractive process chain. This includes both the macroscopic geometric scale and the microscopic scale of the material structure. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives are derived and discussed.",Journal of Machine Engineering,journal,['Review'],8068ee41-f787-4bcf-a76e-d145c91d484e,Journal of Machine Engineering,,,N/A,2023,2023-03-15 00:00:00,10,216,"H.

However, the qualification of PBF-manufactured parts remains challenging and expensive, thereby limiting the broader industrialization of the technology. Powder characteristics significantly influence part properties, and understanding the influencing factors contributes to effective quality standards for PBF. In this study, the influence of the particle size distribution (PSD) median and width on powder flowability and part properties is investigated. Seven gas-atomized SS316L powders with monomodal PSDs, a median particle size ranging from 10 μm to 60 μm, and a distribution width of 15 μm and 30 μm were analyzed and subsequently processed. The PBF-manufactured parts were analyzed in terms of density and melt pool dimensions. Although powder flowability was inversely related to the median particle size, it was unrelated to the distribution width. An inverse relationship between the median particle size and the part density was observed; however, no link was found to the distribution width. Likely, the melt pool depth and width fluctuation significantly influence the part density. The melt pool depth decreases and the width fluctuation increases with an increasing median particle size.",Progress in Additive Manufacturing,,,8af1c7cc-83df-448c-b193-4085c3cca191,Progress in Additive Manufacturing,533 - 542,7,Unknown,2021,2021-12-06 00:00:00,24,33,"M.

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is the most used metal additive manufacturing technique, and it is based on the efficient interaction between a high-energy laser and a metal powder feedstock. To make LPBF more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly, it is of paramount importance to recycle (reuse) the unfused powder from a build job. However, since the laser–powder interaction involves complex physics phenomena and generates by-products which might affect the integrity of the feedstock and the final build part, a better understanding of the overall process should be attained. The present review paper is focused on the clarification of the interaction between laser and metal powder, with a strong focus on its side effects.",Metals,,['Review'],c6119658-6645-4c6e-90d8-d6cfe758ed2b,Metals,,,Unknown,2020,2020-03-04 00:00:00,93,139,"E.

Mathematical methods are employed to formulate and examine the three models under study. Since the paper is theoretical, it does not use any empirical data although numerical illustrations are provided whenever they are appropriate.FindingsThe Harrod-Domar model explains why countries with high rates of saving may also enjoy high rate of economic growth. Both the Solow and Ramsey models can be used to explain the medium-income trap. The paper examines the impact of Covid shocks on the macroeconomy. While the growth rate can be recovered, it may not always possible to recover the output level.Research limitations/implicationsFor the Harrod-Domar model, the public spending decreases the private consumption at the period 1, but there is no change in the capital stock and hence the production in subsequent periods. For the Ramsey model with AK production function, both the private consumption and the outputs will be lowered. In both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function, if the debt is not high and the interest rate is sufficiently low, it is better to use public debt for production rather than for consumption. If the country borrows to recover the Total Factor Productivity after the Covid pandemic, both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function show that the rate of growth is higher for the year just after the pandemic but is the same as before the pandemic.Practical implicationsThe economy can recover the growth rate after a Covid shock, but the recovery process will generally take many periods.Social implicationsThis paper focuses on economic implications and does not aim to examine social implications of policy changes or Covid-type shock.Originality/valueThe paper provides a comparison of three basic growth models with respect to public spending, public debts and repayments and Covid-type shocks.",Fulbright Review of Economics and Policy,journal,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",f076d2d5-bb99-45f6-a4e0-fa5811fc41f3,Fulbright Review of Economics and Policy,,,N/A,2023,2023-10-10 00:00:00,3,10,"C.

This article highlights some recent advances that have had an impact on patient management or could do so in the near future. Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, particularly the epithelioid subtype, is amenable to radical therapy in selected cases, and factors such as ki67 proliferation index, expression of BAP1 and mutation in CDKN2A show promise as prognostic indicators. Our understanding of multicystic mesothelioma has improved in recent years; it is a true neoplasm for which surgery may be indicated. Serous carcinomas involving the peritoneum are now known to originate from tubal epithelium. They are of two distinct types, high grade and low grade, which are now recognized as different neoplasms with distinctive features, oncogenesis and behavior. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is an unusual condition that usually arises from an appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Recent consensus in the classification and nomenclature of these lesions is discussed, including the distinction between low grade and high grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (HAMN), and the diagnostic criteria for appendiceal adenocarcinoma. PMP is divided into four prognostic groups: acellular mucin, low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, and high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei with signet ring cells. The pseudomyxoma microbiome is a promising area for clinical intervention but has been the subject of little research activity. Goblet cell adenocarcinoma (previously known as 'goblet cell carcinoid') is a distinctive type of appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Its behavior correlates with histologic features, but no general consensus for classification has been reached.",Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",61f95257-b067-4f34-bfbd-1381d38d0dea,Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,"

The common goal of these techniques is to forecast the behaviour of the market, which can be translated into various classification tasks, such as, for instance, predicting the likelihood of companies’ bankruptcy or in fraud detection systems. However, it is often the case that real-world financial data are unbalanced, meaning that the classes’ distribution is not equally represented in such datasets. This gives the main issue since any Machine Learning model is trained according to the majority class mainly, leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we explore different data augmentation techniques to deal with very unbalanced financial data. We consider a number of publicly available datasets, then apply state-of-the-art augmentation strategies to them, and finally evaluate the results for several Machine Learning models trained on the sampled data. The performance of the various approaches is evaluated according to their accuracy, micro, and macro F1 score, and finally by analyzing the precision and recall over the minority class. We show that a consistent and accurate improvement is achieved when data augmentation is employed. The obtained classification results look promising and indicate the efficiency of augmentation strategies on financial tasks. On the basis of these results, we present an approach focused on classification tasks within the financial domain that takes a dataset as input, identifies what kind of augmentation technique to use, and then applies an ensemble of all the augmentation techniques of the identified type to the input dataset along with an ensemble of different methods to tackle the underlying classification.",EPJ Data Science,journal,['JournalArticle'],aa12af37-66cf-4a5d-9368-18b04d86d37f,EPJ Data Science,1-31,12,N/A,2023,2023-07-10 00:00:00,3,86,"Golshid Ranjbaran, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Gianfranco Lombardo, S.

We considered the covid pandemic a black swan event that had caused ambiguity. A significant factor that has increased the probability of bankruptcy in recent times has been the large-scale supply chain disruptions and crippling lockdowns. Firms are trying to get back to pre-Covid utilization of plant capacity or pivot their business models differently to seize newer opportunities amidst the crisis. We considered the change in operating expenditure (primarily decrease) as our proxy for uncertainty as firms were forced to cut down majorly on their operations and thus incurred lesser variable costs. In an economy showing inflationary trends, the operating expenses will generally increase. But we found that the operational costs had shown a dip in the case of many of the firms during FY 20–21, and we attributed it to Covid disruptions. Results show that Machine Learning Techniques are better than Logistic Regression in predicting the bankruptcy of firms and that the same predictive power of ascertaining bankruptcy improves when a proxy for uncertainty is added to the model.",Cogent Economics &amp; Finance,Unknown,['JournalArticle'],Unknown,Cogent Economics & Finance,,11,Unknown,2023,2023-05-10 00:00:00,6,43,"Meera Aranha, K.

In this research, we examine a data set of 2,163,147 financial statements of German companies that are triple classified, i.e., solvent, financially distressed, and bankrupt. By classifying text features in terms of granularity and linguistic level of analysis, we show results for the potentials and limitations of approaches developed in this way. This study gives a first approach to evaluate and classify the likelihood of success of text mining approaches for extracting features that enhance the training database of AI-based solutions and improve corporate failure prediction models developed in this way.

Then, monitoring the company's financial situation and predicting its future development becomes important. Assessing the financial health of business entities using various models is an important area in not only scientific research, but also business practice.
Purpose of the article: This study aims to predict the bankruptcy of companies in the engineering and automotive industries of the Slovak Republic using a multilayer neural network and logistic regression. Importantly, we develop a novel an early warning model for the Slovak engineering and automotive industries, which can be applied in countries with undeveloped capital markets.
Methods: Data on the financial ratios of 2,384 companies were used. We used a logistic regression to analyse the data for the year 2019 and designed a logistic model. Meanwhile, the data for the years 2018 and 2019 were analysed using the neural network. In the prediction model, we analysed the predictive performance of several combinations of factors based on the industry sector, use of the scaling technique, activation function, and ratio of the sample distribution to the test and training parts.
Findings & value added: The financial indicators ROS, QR, NWC/A, and PC/S reduce the likelihood of bankruptcy. Regarding the value of this work, we constructed an optimal network for the automotive and engineering industries using nine financial indicators on the input layer in combination with one hidden layer. Moreover, we developed a novel prediction model for bankruptcy using six of these indicators. Almost all sampled industries are privatised, and most companies are foreign owned. Hence, international companies as well as researchers can apply our models to understand their financial health and sustainability. Moreover, they can conduct comparative analyses of their own model with ours to reveal areas of model improvements.",Oeconomia Copernicana,journal,,2ed73a2b-7062-476d-bcf1-7462df506711,Oeconomia Copernicana,,,N/A,2022,2022-12-30 00:00:00,20,0,"B.

The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.",Frontiers in Psychology,journal,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']",89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06,Frontiers in Psychology,,11,N/A,2020,2020-10-19 00:00:00,286,122,"Hui Luan, P.

We evaluated four constructed response assessment items for undergraduate physiology, each targeting five levels of a developing flux learning progression in an ion context. Human-coded datasets were used to train two ML models: (i) an 8-classification algorithm ensemble implemented in the Constructed Response Classifier (CRC), and (ii) a single classification algorithm implemented in LightSide Researcher’s Workbench. Human coding agreement on approximately 700 student responses per item was high for both approaches with Cohen’s kappas ranging from 0.75 to 0.87 on holistic scoring and from 0.78 to 0.89 on analytic composite scoring. ML model performance varied across items and rubric type. For two items, training sets from both coding approaches produced similarly accurate ML models, with differences in Cohen’s kappa between machine and human scores of 0.002 and 0.041. For the other items, ML models trained with analytic coded responses and used for a composite score, achieved better performance as compared to using holistic scores for training, with increases in Cohen’s kappa of 0.043 and 0.117. These items used a more complex scenario involving movement of two ions. It may be that analytic coding is beneficial to unpacking this additional complexity.",Journal of Science Education and Technology,journal,,99823631-94f9-424f-8c7d-e45af666d6b0,Journal of Science Education and Technology,150 - 167,30,N/A,2020,2020-09-26 00:00:00,51,92,"Lauren N.

Particularly in ecological reserves, competition among various types of land use restricts the coordinated development of PLE space. To explore spatial sustainable development, this study starts from a PLE spatial perspective, based on Landsat long time series images. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) and landscape index analysis were selected to monitor the spatial and temporal land use and landscape pattern changes in the Poyang Lake region (PYL region) from 1989 to 2020. The RF-Markov-FLUS coupled model was used to simulate spatial changes in 2030 under four scenarios: production space priority (PSP), living space priority (LSP), ecological space priority (ESP), and an integrated development (ID). Finally, the goal-problem-principle was used to enhance PLE space. The results showed that: (1) production space and ecological spaces decreased in general from 1989 to 2020 by 3% and 7%, respectively; living space increased by 11%. (2) From 1989 to 2020, the overall landscape spread in the Poyang Lake (PYL) area decreased, connectivity decreased, fragmentation increased, landscape heterogeneity increased, and landscape geometry became more irregular. (3) Compared with the other three scenarios, the ID scenario maintained steady production space growth in 2030, the expansion rate of living space slowed, and the area of ecological space decreased the least. (4) Spatial pattern optimization should start with three aspects: the transformation of the agricultural industry, improving the efficiency of urban land use, and establishing communities of “mountains, water, forests, fields, lakes and grasses”. The results provide scientific planning and suggestions for the future ecological protection of Poyang Lake area with multiple scenarios and perspectives.",Remote Sensing,journal,['JournalArticle'],8e1bd4b5-d5b2-4e22-ba0a-01fe5568d472,Remote.

There are numerous seasonal lakes in the Poyang Lake region, and these lakes create a complex and diverse wetland landscape and serve as the main activity area for migratory birds. Seasonal lakes have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes, but research on seasonal lakes is relatively limited. Based on long-term remote sensing images, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of seasonal lakes and their influencing factors and ecological effects. The conclusions were as follows: the average water area of seasonal lakes showed a unimodal change during the year, reaching a maximum in July and a minimum in January. The interannual water area fluctuated greatly, and the overall water area showed a small downward trend. In terms of spatial variation, the seasonal lakes were connected with the main lake in the wet season and separated from the main lake in the dry season. Among the natural factors, the influences of temperature, evaporation, and rainfall on the water area of the seasonal lakes were successively reduced. In addition, the incoming water from the Yangtze River had an important influence. Among the human factors, the traditional fishing method “enclosing sublakes in autumn” had the greatest impact on the water area in a specific period, followed by the indirect impact of the Three Gorges Project.",Water,journal,,2bff3ecd-cb0d-467a-bdff-036c3e4b3e2d,Water,1539,13,N/A,2021,2021-05-30 00:00:00,13,46,"Hai Liu, H.

This paper analyzes changes in cultivated land, the driving factors that cause them, and their tremendous impact on landscape pattern changes in the Dongting Lake Basin. For this purpose, we used mathematical statistics, buffer analysis, trend analysis, landscape pattern index, and logistic regression model to analyze the land use data of the study area from 1980 to 2018. The results show that the cultivated land showed a decreasing trend, with the total area decreased by 4.76% (or 716.13 km2) from 1980 to 2018, and the activity of mutual transformation with other land use types decreased. The spatial distribution pattern of cultivated land and landscape shows the change characteristics gradually from Dongting Lake to the surroundings. Among the driving factors of cultivated land changes, the influence of human activities was gradually increasing, while the natural factors were decreasing. The cultivated land landscape pattern index and the overall landscape pattern index have a significant positive correlation, showing relatively consistent change trend and spatial distribution characteristics. We believe that the decrease of cultivated land area has a certain relationship with the increase of landscape fragmentation in the Dongting Lake Basin.

To evaluate the evolution of habitat quality and its influencing factors in the area, we used Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to interpret the land-use status and used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to analyze the characteristics of changes in habitat quality in the Poyang Lake Eco-Economic Zone (PLEEZ) from 1988 to 2018. The results show that, from 1988 to 2018, land use in the PLEEZ underwent significant changes. The changes in land use led to a gradual increase in habitat degradation and a gradual decrease in habitat quality in the study area. Rapid urbanization notably decreased the habitat quality in the study area. However, at the same time, the ecological protection projects such as returning farmland to forests slowed the decline in habitat quality. Driven by these two factors, habitat quality in the PLEEZ gradually declined but the rate of its decline was suppressed.

However, the clinical relevance of glycosylation-related genes (GRGs) in uveal melanoma (UM) is yet to be fully understood. This study aimed to shed light on the impact of GRGs on UM prognosis. Methods To identify the most influential genes in UM, we employed the AUCell and WGCNA algorithms. The GRGs signature was established by integrating bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. UM patients were separated into two groups based on their risk scores, the GCNS_low and GCNS_high groups, and the differences in clinicopathological correlation, functional enrichment, immune response, mutational burden, and immunotherapy between the two groups were examined. The role of the critical gene AUP1 in UM was validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The GRGs signature was comprised of AUP1, HNMT, PARP8, ARC, ALG5, AKAP13, and ISG20. The GCNS was a significant prognostic factor for UM, and high GCNS correlated with poorer outcomes. Patients with high GCNS displayed heightened immune-related characteristics, such as immune cell infiltration and immune scores. In vitro experiments showed that the knockdown of AUP1 led to a drastic reduction in the viability, proliferation, and invasion capability of UM cells. Conclusion Our gene signature provides an independent predictor of UM patient survival and represents a starting point for further investigation of GRGs in UM.

Circadian rhythm alterations in tumourigenesis are of equal importance to genetic factors and several biologic clock genes are considered to be prognostic biomarkers for various cancers. The aim of this study was to establish reliable markers based on biologic clock genes, thus providing a new perspective for assessing immunotherapy response and prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Methods We used 502 HNSCC samples and 44 normal samples from the TCGA-HNSCC dataset as the training set. 97 samples from GSE41613 were used as an external validation set. Prognostic characteristics of circadian rhythm-related genes (CRRGs) were established by Lasso, random forest and stepwise multifactorial Cox. Multivariate analysis revealed that CRRGs characteristics were independent predictors of HNSCC, with patients in the high-risk group having a worse prognosis than those in the low-risk group. The relevance of CRRGs to the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy was assessed by an integrated algorithm. Results 6-CRRGs were considered to be strongly associated with HNSCC prognosis and a good predictor of HNSCC. The riskscore established by the 6-CRRG was found to be an independent prognostic factor for HNSCC in multifactorial analysis, with patients in the low-risk group having a higher overall survival (OS) than the high-risk group. Nomogram prediction maps constructed from clinical characteristics and riskscore had good prognostic power. Patients in the low-risk group had higher levels of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint expression and were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusion 6-CRRGs play a key predictive role for the prognosis of HNSCC patients and can guide physicians in selecting potential responders to prioritise immunotherapy, which could facilitate further research in precision immuno-oncology.",Frontiers in Immunology,journal,['JournalArticle'],3f7605a7-7e53-4ff7-8895-42f09a5f4355,Frontiers in Immunology,,14,N/A,2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,55,87,"Hao Chi, Jinyan Yang, Gaoge Peng, Jinhao Zhang, Guobin Song, Xixi Xie, Zhijia Xia, Jinhui Liu, Gang Tian","2056175119, 2000447626, 2181790063, 2117980663, 2072632648, 2242086213, 103297759, 2108412351, 2146933862",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a219d3fa9537f2c44ef9735cc00f4bbede0d71b8,Medicine,2056175119

In pancreatic β-cells, both lipid- and Ca2+ signaling are essential for insulin secretion.

We now show that TMEM24 only weakly interact with the PM, and dissociates in response to both diacylglycerol and nanomolar elevations of cytosolic Ca2+.

Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.",Energies,journal,['Review'],1cd505d9-195d-4f99-b91c-169e872644d4,Energies,,,N/A,2022,2022-08-28 00:00:00,216,75,"D.

Although the UAE University has a well-established Banner Registration System, however, course planning performed by the faculty and staff at department and college level sometimes is short of required expertise and qualification. Students have faced problems due to lack of a proper advising system as well as an inadequacy of seeking proper advice. An EE Course Planning Software System (EE-CPSS) package is devised in this respect. The software is developed by using the Python computer programming language. This system helps students in selecting from four to seven most suitable courses to register in the next semester. The outcome of the course selection is stored in a file for future reference.",Journal of Software,journal,['JournalArticle'],73585779-8f95-43d4-be17-c74ed16aebd9,J.

However, given the complexity of learning analytics (LA) systems, it can be challenging to meaningfully involve non-technical stakeholders throughout their design and development. This article reports on the iterative co-design, development, and classroom evaluation of Konscia, a wearable, real-time awareness tool for teachers working in AI-enhanced K-12 classrooms. In the process, we argue that the co-design of LA systems requires new kinds of prototyping methods. We introduce one of our own prototyping methods, REs, to address unique challenges of co-prototyping LA tools. This work presents the first end-to-end demonstration of how non-technical stakeholders can participate throughout the whole design process for a complex LA system—from early generative phases to the selection and tuning of analytics to evaluation in real-world contexts. We conclude by providing methodological recommendations for future LA co-design efforts.

The purpose of this paper is to present a decade of experience with analyzing and improving an online practice environment for math, which has thus far recorded over a billion responses. We present the methods we use to both steer and analyze this system in real-time, using scoring rules on accuracy and response times, a tailored rating system to provide both learners and items with current ability and difficulty ratings, and an adaptive engine that matches learners to items. Moreover, we explore the quality of fit by means of prediction accuracy and parallel item reliability. Limitations and pitfalls are discussed by diagnosing sources of misfit, like violations of unidimensionality and unforeseen dynamics. Finally, directions for development are discussed, including embedded learning analytics and a focus on online experimentation to evaluate both the system itself and the users’ learning gains. Though many challenges remain open, we believe that large steps have been made in providing methods to efficiently manage and research educational big data from a massive online learning system.",Journal of Learning Analytics,journal,['JournalArticle'],1355ccee-1cfd-459c-8df4-bc82e5f741da,J.

The software is a fast implementation of random forests for high dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression and survival trees are supported. We describe the implementation, provide examples, validate the package with a reference implementation, and compare runtime and memory usage with other implementations. The new software proves to scale best with the number of features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting. Finally, we show that ranger is the fastest and most memory efficient implementation of random forests to analyze data on the scale of a genome-wide association study.",,Unknown,,Unknown,Journal of Statistical Software,1-17,077,Unknown,2015,2015-08-18 00:00:00,2649,30,"Marvin N.
