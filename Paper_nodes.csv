10.3390/en17040925,Insights into Household Electric Vehicle Charging Behavior: Analysis and Predictive Modeling,"In the era of burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) popularity, understanding the patterns of EV users’ behavior is imperative. This paper examines the trends in household charging sessions’ timing, duration, and energy consumption by analyzing real-world residential charging data. By leveraging the information collected from each session, a novel framework is introduced for the efficient, real-time prediction of important charging characteristics. Utilizing historical data and user-specific features, machine learning models are trained to predict the connection duration, charging duration, charging demand, and time until the next session. These models enhance the understanding of EV users’ behavior and provide practical tools for optimizing the EV charging infrastructure and effectively managing the charging demand. As the transportation sector becomes increasingly electrified, this work aims to empower stakeholders with insights and reliable models, enabling them to anticipate the localized demand and contribute to the sustainable integration of electric vehicles into the grid.",2024.0,2024-02-16,5,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00000c33779acab142af6c7a6dae8b36fac0805d
10.2196/41566,Personalized Prediction of Response to Smartphone-Delivered Meditation Training: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background Meditation apps have surged in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals turning to these apps to cope with stress, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” (PAI) reflecting an individual’s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

10.1002/anbr.202300085,Machine Learning‐Based Prediction of Immunomodulatory Properties of Polymers: Toward a Faster and Easier Development of Anti‐Inflammatory Biomaterials,"In biomaterials development, creating materials with desirable properties can be a time‐consuming and resource‐intensive process, often relying on serendipitous discoveries. A potential route to accelerate this process is to employ artificial intelligence methodologies such as machine learning (ML). Herein, the possibility to predict anti‐inflammatory properties of the polymers by using a simplified model of inflammation and a restrained dataset is explored. Cellular assays with 50 different polymers are conducted using the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. These experiments generate a dataset which is used to develop a ML model based on Bayesian logistic regression. After conducting a Bayesian logistic regression analysis, two ML models, K‐nearest neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes, are employed to predict anti‐inflammatory polymers properties. The study finds that the probability of a polymer having anti‐inflammatory properties is multiplied by three if it is a polycation, and that nitric oxide secretion is a good indicator in determining the anti‐inflammatory properties of a polymer, which in this work are defined by tumor necrosis factor alpha expression decrease. Overall, the study suggests that with appropriate dataset design, ML techniques can provide valuable information on functional polymer properties, enabling faster and more efficient biomaterial development.",2024.0,2024-01-08,2,18,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00017dccee63f60b8af0acb7d08831b29bc4e3a6

10.3389/fonc.2025.1531465,The aggrephagy-related gene TUBA1B influences clinical outcomes in glioma patients by regulating the cell cycle,"Background Gliomas are common primary malignant brain tumors, with glioblastoma (GBM) being the most aggressive subtype. GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high TUBA1B expression is closely associated with glioma malignancy and poor prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target.",2025.0,2025-02-28,0,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d0ebfeb82a9c0fe964bd5ca0811f352883cf

Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 203 patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI before prostate biopsy were included. After manual segmentation, radiomic features (RFs) were extracted from T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, and high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI). Patients were split into training sets and testing sets according to a ratio of 8:2. A pipeline considering combinations of two feature selection (FS) methods and six ML classifiers was developed and evaluated. The performance of models was assessed using the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1-measure, and the area under curve (AUC). Results: On high b-value DWMRI-derived features, a combination of FS method recursive feature elimination (RFE) and classifier random forest achieved the highest performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs, with 97.0% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity, 98.0% precision, and 97.0% F1-measure. The method also achieved an average AUC for GG of 98%. Conclusion: Preoperative mpMRI radiomic analysis based on ML, as a noninvasive approach, showed good performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs. Advances in Knowledge: Herein, radiomic models based on preoperative mpMRI and ML were developed to classify prostate cancer into 5 GGs. Our study provides evidence that analysis of quantitative RFs extracted from high b-value DWMRI images based on a combination of FS method RFE and classifier random forest can be applied for multiclass grading of prostate cancer with an accuracy of 97.0%.",2024.0,2024-12-01,0,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00026937c840c52bf8b75ff78140f386c0f172dc

This study aims to ascertain differences in the importance features of machine learning models of household disaster preparedness for four groups to inform culturally tailored intervention recommendations for nursing practice. A machine learning model was developed and tested by combining data from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Federal Emergency Management Agency National Household Survey. The primary outcome variable was a composite readiness score. A total of 252 variables from 15,048 participants were included. Over 10% of the sample self-identified as African American/Black and 30.3% reported being 65 years of age or older. Importance features varied regarding financial and insurance preparedness, information seeking and transportation between groups. These results reiterate the need for targeted interventions to support financial resilience and equitable resource access.

10.1101/2024.09.19.613896,CanDrivR-CS: A Cancer-Specific Machine Learning Framework for Distinguishing Recurrent and Rare Variants,"Motivation Missense variants play a crucial role in cancer development, and distinguishing between those that frequently occur in cancer genomes and those that are rare may provide valuable insights into important functional mechanisms and consequences. Specifically, if common variants confer growth advantages, they may have undergone positive selection across different patients due to similar selection pressures. Moreover, studies have demonstrated the significance of rare mutations that arise as resistance mechanisms in response to drug treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of both recurrent and rare variants in cancer. In addition to this, most existing tools for variant prediction focus on distinguishing variants found in normal and disease populations, often without considering the specific disease contexts in which these variants arise. Instead, they typically build predictors that generalise across all diseases. Here, we introduce CanDrivR-CS, a set of cancer-specific gradient boosting models designed to distinguish between rare and recurrent cancer variants. Results We curated missense variant data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Cancer-type-specific models significantly outperformed a baseline pan-cancer model, achieving a maximum leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) F1 score of up to 90% for CanDrivRSKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma) and 89% for CanDrivR-SKCA (Skin Adenocarcinoma), compared to 79.2% for the baseline model. Notably, DNA shape properties consistently ranked among the top features for distinguishing recurrent and rare variants across all cancers. Specifically, recurrent missense variants frequently occurred in DNA bends and rolls, potentially implicating regions prone to DNA replication errors and acting as mutational hotspots. Availability and Implementation All training and test data, and Python code are available in our CanDrivR-CS GitHub repository: https://github.com/amyfrancis97/CanDrivR-CS.",2024.0,2024-09-23,0,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0002fbf6371786ec4d0e869b0d9ec33412c51ccb

10.3390/w14081300,An Improved Transfer Learning Model for Cyanobacterial Bloom Concentration Prediction,"The outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms is a serious water environmental problem, and the harm it brings to aquatic ecosystems and water supply systems cannot be underestimated. It is very important to establish an accurate prediction model of cyanobacterial bloom concentration, which is a challenging issue. Machine learning techniques can improve the prediction accuracy, but a large amount of historical monitoring data is needed to train these models. For some waters with an inconvenient geographical location or frequent sensor failures, there are not enough historical data to train the model. To deal with this problem, a fused model based on a transfer learning method is proposed in this paper. In this study, the data of water environment with a large amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the source domain in order to learn the knowledge of cyanobacterial bloom growth characteristics and train the prediction model. The data of the water environment with a small amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the target domain in order to load the model trained in the source domain. Then, the training set of the target domain is used to participate in the inter-layer fine-tuning training of the model to obtain the transfer learning model. At last, the transfer learning model is fused with a convolutional neural network to obtain the prediction model. Various experiments are conducted for a 2 h prediction on the test set of the target domain. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of cyanobacterial blooms for the water environment with a low data volume.",2022.0,2022-04-16,9,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0003e0ac0f8f4b50065f0e0c43b95896639fe2a3

However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.",2021.0,2021-09-01,31,81,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00040bdd447f041a50ae95fd51926cf435ef1eba

10.3390/s23031639,At the Confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Edge Computing in IoT-Based Applications: A Review and New Perspectives,"Given its advantages in low latency, fast response, context-aware services, mobility, and privacy preservation, edge computing has emerged as the key support for intelligent applications and 5G/6G Internet of things (IoT) networks. This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents. These are the same factors that most studies have used to evaluate the success of an edge-based application. In this review, we first provide an in-depth analysis of the state of the art of AI in edge-based applications with a focus on eight application areas: smart agriculture, smart environment, smart grid, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart education, smart transportation, and security and privacy. Then, we present a qualitative comparison that emphasizes the main objective of the confluence, the roles and the use of artificial intelligence at the network edge, and the key enabling technologies for edge analytics.

10.3389/fcell.2022.937761,Spontaneous Activity Predicts Survival of Developing Cortical Neurons,"Spontaneous activity plays a crucial role in brain development by coordinating the integration of immature neurons into emerging cortical networks. High levels and complex patterns of spontaneous activity are generally associated with low rates of apoptosis in the cortex. However, whether spontaneous activity patterns directly encode for survival of individual cortical neurons during development remains an open question. Here, we longitudinally investigated spontaneous activity and apoptosis in developing cortical cultures, combining extracellular electrophysiology with calcium imaging. These experiments demonstrated that the early occurrence of calcium transients was strongly linked to neuronal survival. Silent neurons exhibited a higher probability of cell death, whereas high frequency spiking and burst behavior were almost exclusively detected in surviving neurons. In local neuronal clusters, activity of neighboring neurons exerted a pro-survival effect, whereas on the functional level, networks with a high modular topology were associated with lower cell death rates. Using machine learning algorithms, cell fate of individual neurons was predictable through the integration of spontaneous activity features. Our results indicate that high frequency spiking activity constrains apoptosis in single neurons through sustained calcium rises and thereby consolidates networks in which a high modular topology is reached during early development.",2022.0,2022-08-10,12,105,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005578d0e79d27dba8001b7f16c759b80ae4414

10.48175/ijarsct-14367,Challenges Faced During Implementation of Digital Twin in Construction Project Monitoring,"Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining popularity because they provide precise digital copies of assets, processes, and systems. This is especially true when these DTs are paired with real-time simulation models that make use of modern technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. These combinations can provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of the monitored systems. Digital twin (DT) has shown tremendous potential to bring about revolutionary improvements in the field of construction site surveillance. There is, however, a notable paucity of empirical research identifying the constant elements affecting DT adoption in this industry. This research tries to fill that void by identifying the important elements that determine the usage of DT in construction. The study adopts a complete framework with the goal of increasing the use of DT in building site monitoring. The elements influencing the adoption and effectiveness of distributed ledger technology (DT) are divided into three categories: technological, organizational, and economic. Technological factors include the system's appropriateness and the robustness of the data infrastructure. Organizational considerations include the company's openness to innovation and leadership support. Economic aspects include things like return on investment (ROI) and cost-effectiveness. The research technique combines case studies and literature reviews to examine the benefits and drawbacks of DT in construction monitoring. This study's expected output is a comprehensive framework that aids construction businesses in optimizing the use of DT in site monitoring. This would allow for more efficient, data-driven, and forward-thinking processes. The study's ultimate purpose is to provide critical knowledge that will assist the building sector in adopting cutting-edge methods. The industry may better plan for the integration of this sophisticated technology into their operations by knowing the potential of DT and the variables driving its adoption. This, in turn, can lead to more efficiency, lower risks, and improved overall performance",2023.0,2023-12-31,0,19,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005652ac7e1bed2163fa6815bb38172fae80525

10.3390/agriculture14111900,UAV-Based Multispectral Winter Wheat Growth Monitoring with Adaptive Weight Allocation,"Comprehensive growth index (CGI) more accurately reflects crop growth conditions than single indicators, which is crucial for precision irrigation, fertilization, and yield prediction. However, many current studies overlook the relationships between different growth parameters and their varying contributions to yield, leading to overlapping information and lower accuracy in monitoring crop growth. Therefore, this study focuses on winter wheat and constructs a comprehensive growth monitoring index (CGIac), based on adaptive weight allocation of growth parameters’ contribution to yield, using data such as leaf area index (LAI), soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, plant height (PH), biomass (BM), and plant water content (PWC). Using UAV data on vegetation indices, feature selection was performed using the Elastic Net. The growth inversion model was then constructed using machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector regression (SVR). Based on the optimal growth inversion model for winter wheat, spatial distribution of wheat growth in the study area is obtained. The findings demonstrated that CGIac outperforms CGIav (constructed using equal weighting) and CGIcv (built using the coefficient of variation) in yield correlation and prediction accuracy. Specifically, the yield correlation of CGIac improved by up to 0.76 compared to individual indices, while yield prediction accuracy increased by up to 23.14%. Among the evaluated models, the RF model achieved the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.895 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0058. A comparison with wheat orthophotos from the same period confirmed that the inversion results were highly consistent with actual growth conditions in the study area. The proposed method significantly improved the accuracy and applicability of winter wheat growth monitoring, overcoming the limitations of single parameters in growth prediction. Additionally, it provided new technological support and innovative solutions for regional crop monitoring and precision farming operations.",2024.0,2024-10-26,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005a412ddf59452f7c58c49b6060a62d0bba0f1

In this work reactions are labeled with experimental conditions and network analysis shows that consistencies within clusters of data points can be leveraged to organize this information. In particular, this analysis shows how particular experimental conditions (specifically solvent) are effective in enabling specific organic reactions (Friedel-Crafts, Aldol addition, Claisen condensation, Diels-Alder, and Wittig), including variations within each reaction class. An example of network analysis is shown in the graphical abstract, where data points for a Claisen condensation reaction break into clusters that depend on the catalyst and chemical structure. This type of clustering, which mimics how a chemist reasons, is derived directly from the network. Therefore the findings of this work could augment synthesis planning by providing predictions in a fashion that mimics human chemists. To numerically evaluate solvent prediction ability, three methods are compared: network analysis (through the k-nearest neighbor algorithm), a support vector machine, and a deep neural network. The most accurate method in 4 of the 5 test cases is the network analysis, with deep neural networks also showing good prediction scores. The network analysis tool was evaluated by an expert panel of chemists, who generally agreed that the algorithm produced accurate solvent choices while simultaneously being transparent in the underlying reasons for its predictions.",2019.0,2019-08-05,36,69,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00077e00481acb73962abedf99cc71dfeb497a08

They are likely to provide many lead structures, which can be used as templates for the construction of novel drugs with enhanced antitumor activity. Traditional research approaches studied structure-activity relationship of natural products and obtained key structural properties, such as chemical bond or group, with the purpose of ascertaining their effect on a single cell line or a single tissue type. Here, for the first time, we develop a machine learning method to comprehensively predict natural products responses against a panel of cancer cell lines based on both the gene expression and the chemical properties of natural products. The results on two datasets, training set and independent test set, show that this proposed method yields significantly better prediction accuracy. In addition, we also demonstrate the predictive power of our proposed method by modeling the cancer cell sensitivity to two natural products, Curcumin and Resveratrol, which indicate that our method can effectively predict the response of cancer cell lines to these two natural products. Taken together, the method will facilitate the identification of natural products as cancer therapies and the development of precision medicine by linking the features of patient genomes to natural product sensitivity.",2015.0,2015-11-26,14,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00088b98a908818352fe051fe98f42f25a460b85

10.1049/rpg2.12985,Exploring the application of machine‐learning techniques in the next generation of long‐term hydropower‐thermal scheduling,"This paper introduces a shape‐based inflow scenarios reduction framework applied in long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling. This scheduling problem involves strategically managing the limited stored hydro energy in coordination with the electricity system. The scenario fan problem, selected as a long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling approach, can effectively represent the individual hydropower plants and their short‐term flexibility within the long‐term scheduling process, making it well‐suited for capturing the disaggregated physical characteristics of hydro stations. However, the computational burden of scenario fan problem increases due to the complexity of the cascaded system and the large number of inflow scenarios. To tackle these challenges, a machine learning clustering method is developed for extracting shape‐based features to capture the energy and shape attributes of hydro inflows. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing it with four established clustering methods. This evaluation was carried out on a hydro‐thermal test case, utilizing both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample data analysis. The findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other methods in terms of computational time by 42.6% and optimal reservoir trajectories by 12.1% considering K‐means using Euclidean distance as the benchmark. Additionally, this study showcases the feasibility of performing long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling at a granular level, with detailed topological information and a shorter time scale.

The crucial role of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) gene family in the tumor microenvironment of HCC remains unclear. Methods This study employed a novel multi-omics integration strategy to investigate the potential roles of ADAM family signals in HCC. A series of single-cell and spatial omics algorithms were utilized to uncover the molecular characteristics of ADAM family genes within HCC. The GSVA package was utilized to compute the scores for ADAM family signals, subsequently stratified into three categories: high, medium, and low ADAM signal levels through unsupervised clustering. Furthermore, we developed and rigorously validated an innovative and robust clinical prognosis assessment model by employing 99 mainstream machine learning algorithms in conjunction with co-expression feature spectra of ADAM family genes. To validate our findings, we conducted PCR and IHC experiments to confirm differential expression patterns within the ADAM family genes. Results Gene signals from the ADAM family were notably abundant in endothelial cells, liver cells, and monocyte macrophages. Single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analyses have both revealed the molecular heterogeneity of the ADAM gene family, further emphasizing its significant impact on the development and progression of HCC. In HCC tissues, the expression levels of ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 were markedly elevated. Elevated ADAM family signal scores were linked to adverse clinical outcomes and disruptions in the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming. An ADAM prognosis signal, developed through the utilization of 99 machine learning algorithms, could accurately forecast the survival duration of HCC, achieving an AUC value of approximately 0.9. Conclusions This study represented the inaugural report on the deleterious impact and prognostic significance of ADAM family signals within the tumor microenvironment of HCC.",2024.0,2024-09-13,4,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a5d98243250c138efd38742555d600655a9e5

10.3390/ijerph16142598,Hip and Wrist-Worn Accelerometer Data Analysis for Toddler Activities,"Although accelerometry data are widely utilized to estimate physical activity and sedentary behavior among children age 3 years or older, for toddlers age 1 and 2 year(s), accelerometry data recorded during such behaviors have been far less examined. In particular, toddler’s unique behaviors, such as riding in a stroller or being carried by an adult, have not yet been examined. The objective of this study was to describe accelerometry signal outputs recorded during participation in nine types of behaviors (i.e., running, walking, climbing up/down, crawling, riding a ride-on toy, standing, sitting, riding in a stroller/wagon, and being carried by an adult) among toddlers. Twenty-four toddlers aged 13 to 35 months (50% girls) performed various prescribed behaviors during free play in a commercial indoor playroom while wearing ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on a hip and a wrist. Participants’ performances were video-recorded. Based on the video data, accelerometer data were annotated with behavior labels to examine accelerometry signal outputs while performing the nine types of behaviors. Accelerometer data collected during 664 behavior assessments from the 21 participants were used for analysis. Hip vertical axis counts for walking were low (median = 49 counts/5 s). They were significantly lower than those recorded while a toddler was “carried” by an adult (median = 144 counts/5 s; p < 0.01). While standing, sitting, and riding in a stroller, very low hip vertical axis counts were registered (median ≤ 5 counts/5 s). Although wrist vertical axis and vector magnitude counts for “carried” were not higher than those for walking, they were higher than the cut-points for sedentary behaviors. Using various accelerometry signal features, machine learning techniques showed 89% accuracy to differentiate the “carried” behavior from ambulatory movements such as running, walking, crawling, and climbing. In conclusion, hip vertical axis counts alone may be unable to capture walking as physical activity and “carried” as sedentary behavior among toddlers. Machine learning techniques that utilize additional accelerometry signal features could help to recognize behavior types, especially to differentiate being “carried” from ambulatory movements.",2019.0,2019-07-01,15,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a71f483a2798bc7411f9fcc6af3a66d0a08c7

Graphs are essential in many domains, such as the description of chemical molecules, biological networks, social relationships, etc. Real-world graphs are complicated and large. As a result, there is a need to find a way to represent or encode a graph’s structure so that it can be easily utilized by machine learning models. Therefore, graph embedding is considered one of the most powerful solutions for graph representation. Inspired by the Doc2Vec model in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this paper first investigates different ways of (sub)graph embedding to represent each graph or subgraph as a fixed-length feature vector, which is then used as input to any classifier. Thus, two supervised classifiers—a deep neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)—are proposed to enhance graph classification. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed models obtain competitive results and are superior to some traditional classification methods and deep-learning-based approaches on three out of five benchmark datasets, with an impressive accuracy rate of 94% on the NCI1 dataset.",2023.0,2023-06-17,3,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a9f529fdcac451cd35d7303bcc64ea2a9fcbc

Herein, a flexible biomimetic ANS with multimode fuzzy perception and brain‐like cognition is developed, by fusing the ion migration‐modulated MXene synapse and machine learning (ML). First of all, the elementary perceptual ability to mimic biological neuroreceptors is demonstrated. Motion artifact in the ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) current is eliminated.

10.1021/acs.jpca.1c09984,"C2H5NO Isomers: From Acetamide to 1,2-Oxazetidine and Beyond","This work documents the properties of a number of isomers of molecular formula C2H5NO from the most stable, acetamide, through 1,2-oxazetidine and including even higher energy species largely of a dipolar nature. Only two of the isomers have been detected in emissions from the interstellar medium (ISM); possible further candidates are identified, and the likelihood of their being detectable is considered. In general, hardly any of these compounds have been discussed in the existing chemical literature, so this work represents an important contribution extending the canon of chemical bonding which can contribute to machine learning, providing a more exacting test of AI applications. The presence in the ISM of acetamide, CH3C(O)NH2, is the subject of current debate with no clear and obvious paths to its formation; it is shown that a 1,3-[H]-transfer from (E,Z)-ethanimidic acid, CH3C(OH)=NH, is feasible in spite of an energy barrier of 130 kJ mol–1. It is speculated that imidic acid can itself be formed from abundant precursors, H2O and CH3C≡N, in an acid-induced, water addition, autocatalytic reaction on water–ice grains.

10.3390/sym13030486,Towards Accurate Scene Text Detection with Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network,"Scene text detection, this task of detecting text from real images, is a hot research topic in the machine vision community. Most of the current research is based on an anchor box. These methods are complex in model design and time-consuming to train. In this paper, we propose a new Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection (FCOS)-based text detection method that can robustly detect multioriented and multilingual text from natural scene images in a per pixel prediction approach. Our proposed text detector employs an anchor-free approach, unlike state-of-the-art text detectors that do not rely on a predefined anchor box. In order to enhance the feature representation ability of FCOS for text detection tasks, we apply the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) as the backbone network, enhancing the model learning capacity and increasing the receptive field. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on multioriented (ICDAR-2015, ICDAR-2017 MLT) and horizontal (ICDAR-2013) text detection benchmark tasks. Moreover, our method has an f-measure of 88.65 and 86.32 for the benchmark datasets ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015, respectively, and 80.75 for the ICDAR-2017 MLT dataset.",2021.0,2021-03-16,8,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d0a52ce890a794b16d3379f96c6cbb7e0acaa

The goal is to enhance networking within these dynamic environments. By leveraging SDN's centralized control capabilities, this study aims to optimize network performance, enhance security, and improve the quality of service in 5G-VANETs. The outcomes of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems and vehicular communication networks. As the VANET milieu operates dynamically, the major issues are to afford high reliability, low latency, and high bandwidth. 5G significantly provides seamless connectivity and ultrafast speed for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Advancements in internet of vehicle brought few security issues such as illegal device access, data injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To avoid these issues, this work implements the Package Filtering Model (PFM) that is trained using machine learning and ready to use for real-time detection. It filters out the fraudulent transaction based on the frequency and behavioural characteristics of the communication. The simulation results ensure that the proposed mechanism affords enhanced packet delivery, lower transmission delay, minimum fraud package, and bare minimum block processing time compared to the existing state-of-the-art mechanisms.",2025.0,2025-02-28,0,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d5261e4bc230a8c8aacdd3aab5e878a8da174

A systemic review and a meta-analysis. We also provided a retrospective cohort for validation in this study.


OBJECTIVE
(1) Using a meta-analysis to determine the pooled discriminatory ability of The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classical algorithm (CA) and machine learning algorithms (MLA); and (2) test the hypothesis that SORG-CA has less variability in performance than SORG-MLA in non-American validation cohorts as SORG-CA does not incorporates regional-specific variables such as body mass index as input.


METHODS
After data extraction from the included studies, logit-transformation was applied for extracted AUCs for further analysis. The discriminatory abilities of both algorithms were directly compared by their logit (AUC)s. Further subgroup analysis by region (America vs non-America) was also conducted by comparing the corresponding logit (AUC).


RESULTS
The pooled logit (AUC)s of 90-day SORG-CA was .82 (95% confidence interval [CI], .53-.11), 1-year SORG-CA was 1.11 (95% CI, .74-1.48), 90-day SORG-MLA was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.63), and 1-year SORG-MLA was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.17-1.98). All the algorithms performed better in United States than in Taiwan (P < .001). The performance of SORG-CA was less influenced by a non-American cohort than SORG-MLA.

We hypothesized that signal processing and machine learning methods can be used to discriminate EEG in a direct ""yes""/""no"" BCI from a single session. Blind source separation (BSS) and spectral transformations of the EEG produced a 180-dimensional feature space. We used a modified genetic algorithm (GA) wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to search the space of feature subsets. The GA-based search found feature subsets that outperform full feature sets and random feature subsets.

10.1177/2053951719849444,The combine will tell the truth: On precision agriculture and algorithmic rationality,"Recent technological and methodological changes in farming have led to an emerging set of claims about the role of digital technology in food production. Known as precision agriculture, the integration of digital management and surveillance technologies in farming is normatively presented as a revolutionary transformation. Proponents contend that machine learning, Big Data, and automation will create more accurate, efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly food production, staving off both food insecurity and ecological ruin. This article contributes a critique of these rhetorical and discursive claims to a growing body of critical literature on precision agriculture. It argues precision agriculture is less a revolution than an evolution, an effort to shore up and intensify the conventional farming system responsible for generating many of the social and environmental problems precision agriculture is presented as solving. While precision agriculture advocates portray it as a radical, even democratic epistemological break with the past, this paper locates truth claims surrounding datafication and algorithmic control in farming within deeper historical contexts of the capitalist rationalization of production and efforts to quantify and automate physical and mental labor. Abjuring the growing cultural tendency to treat algorithmic systems as revolutionary in favor of social and historical dimensions of precision agriculture, can help re-frame the discussion about its design and use around real, socially and ecologically oriented change in farming, and so ensure that the possibilities and benefits of precision agriculture are as evenly and effectively shared as possible.",2019.0,2019-01-01,114,81,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f4079fb3f5463ce7f5e566b541fec68a91f02

With the advancements in technology, machine learning architectures have become increasingly diverse and sophisticated, providing enhanced capabilities for fruit image classification. However, previous studies have primarily focused on classifying fruits at a basic level. Therefore, there is a growing need for the development and application of Fruit Image Classification systems within the community, particularly in the field of agriculture. Such applications can play a pivotal role in leveraging technology to benefit the agricultural sector, empowering users to gain satisfaction and knowledge regarding different fruits through the utilization of these applications. In this study, we employ both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and a Residual Network-50 for fruit image classification. To ensure robust performance evaluation, the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, with fruits categorized into specific classes. Furthermore, identical preprocessing and optimization techniques are applied to both architectures to maintain consistency and fairness during the evaluation process. The results of our classification experiments on a dataset consisting of 17 different fruit classes reveal that the conventional CNN architecture achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.998 (99%) with a minimal loss of 0.009. On the other hand, the Residual Network-50 demonstrates a slightly lower accuracy of 0.994 (99%) but with a slightly higher loss of 0.02. Despite the higher loss, the Residual Network-50's accuracy remains comparable to that of the conventional architecture, showcasing its potential for fruit image classification.

Datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We integrated the datasets, removed the batch effects and analyzed immune cell infiltration along with differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the positively correlated gene modules. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-cox regression analysis was performed to screen the characteristic genes. The intersection of the DEGs, characteristic genes and module genes was identified as the risk genes. The WGCNA analysis demonstrates that the blue module was highly correlated and statistically significant as well as enriched in immune-related signaling pathways and biological functions in the KEGG and GO enrichment. LASSO-cox regression analysis screened 11 characteristic genes from the hub genes of the blue module. After the DEG, characteristic gene and immune-related gene datasets were intersected, three genes, PTGS1, HLA-DMB and GPR137B, were identified as the risk genes in this research. In this research, we identified three risk genes related to the immune system in osteoarthritis and provide a feasible approach to drug development in the future.",2023.0,2023-02-01,10,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011467a75469d9751eab6897a400de8bd47da95

10.3390/buildings14030820,Research on Prediction of EPB Shield Tunneling Parameters Based on LGBM,"At present, the determination of tunnel parameters mainly rely on engineering experience and human judgment, which leads to the subjective decision of parameters and an increased construction risk. Machine learning algorithms could provide an objective theoretical basis for tunnel parameter decision making. However, due to the limitations of a machine learning model’s performance and parameter selection methods, the prediction model had poor prediction results and low reliability for parameter research. To solve the above problems, based on a large number of construction parameters of a composite section subway in Shenzhen, this paper combined dimensionality reduction data with service analysis to optimize the selection process of shield tunneling parameters, and determined the total propulsion force, cutter head torque, cutter head speed, and advance rate as key tunneling parameters. Based on an LGBM algorithm and Bayesian optimization, the prediction model of key tunneling parameters of an earth pressure balance shield was established. The results showed that the average error of the LGBM model on the test set was 8.18%, the average error of the cutter head torque was 13.93%, the average error of the cutter head speed was 3.16%, and the average error of advance rate was 13.35%. Compared with the RF model, the prediction effect and the generalization on the test set were better. Therefore, an LGBM algorithm could be used as an effective prediction method for tunneling parameters in tunnel construction and provide guidance for the setting of tunneling parameters.",2024.0,2024-03-18,1,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011cc42b727f0c20683a45184e30bcc6668835c

Nowadays, going 24 hours without getting in touch with them in some way has become difficult. Facebook and Twitter, these social platforms are now part of everyday life. Thus, these social networks have become important sources to be aware of frequently discussed topics or public opinions on a current issue. A lot of people write messages about current events, give their opinion on any topic and discuss social issues more and more. The emergence and enormous popularity of these social networks have led to the emergence of several types of analysis to take advantage of them. One of them is the analysis of opinions in texts. It aims at automatically classifying opinions in order to position them on a sentiment scale, thus allowing to characterize a set of opinions without having to rely on a human to read them. Currently, opinion analysis offers us a lot of information related to public opinion, either in the commercial world or in the political world. Many studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB), perform well in this type of classification. In our study, we first propose an approach for tracking and analyzing political opinions in social networks. Then, we propose a trained and evaluated machine learning model for political opinion classification. And finally, the study aims at setting up a web interface to collect and analyze in real time political opinions from social networks",2021.0,2021-10-31,0,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011fc48fe76fd7f48139a75f9bdf1a83e0f4cd9

When the size of datasets becomes very large, it may be infeasible to store all of the high-dimensional datasets on one machine, or at least to keep the datasets in memory. In this paper, we consider penalized expectile regression using smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and adaptive LASSO penalties, which can effectively detect the heteroskedasticity of high-dimensional data. We propose a communication-efficient approach for distributed sparsity learning, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines.

10.3390/app112210795,Fine-Grained Named Entity Recognition Using a Multi-Stacked Feature Fusion and Dual-Stacked Output in Korean,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task to identify spans that mention named entities and to annotate them with predefined named entity classes. Although many NER models based on machine learning have been proposed, their performance in terms of processing fine-grained NER tasks was less than acceptable. This is because the training data of a fine-grained NER task is much more unbalanced than those of a coarse-grained NER task. To overcome the problem presented by unbalanced data, we propose a fine-grained NER model that compensates for the sparseness of fine-grained NEs by using the contextual information of coarse-grained NEs. From another viewpoint, many NER models have used different levels of features, such as part-of-speech tags and gazetteer look-up results, in a nonhierarchical manner. Unfortunately, these models experience the feature interference problem. Our solution to this problem is to adopt a multi-stacked feature fusion scheme, which accepts different levels of features as its input. The proposed model is based on multi-stacked long short-term memories (LSTMs) with a multi-stacked feature fusion layer for acquiring multilevel embeddings and a dual-stacked output layer for predicting fine-grained NEs based on the categorical information of coarse-grained NEs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed model is capable of state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the proposed model can effectively alleviate the unbalanced data problem that frequently occurs in a fine-grained NER task. In addition, the multi-stacked feature fusion layer contributes to the improvement of NER performance, confirming that the proposed model can alleviate the feature interference problem. Based on this experimental result, we conclude that the proposed model is well-designed to effectively perform NER tasks.",2021.0,2021-11-15,5,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0014ecb6e7055de7b3bef3d5619446c24fdf0db4

Conveniently, these compact devices are also equipped with high-precision transducers such as accelerometers and microphones, integrated mechanically and designed on-board to support a range of user functionalities. However, unintended access to these transducer signals (bypassing normal on-board data access controls) may allow sensitive user interaction information to be detected and thereby exploited. In this study, we show that acoustic features extracted from the on-board microphone signals, supported with accelerometer and gyroscope signals, may be used together with machine learning techniques to successfully determine the user’s touch input location on a touchscreen: our ensemble model, namely the random forest model, predicts touch input location with up to 86% accuracy in a realistic scenario. Accordingly, we present the approach and techniques used, the performance of the model developed, and also discuss limitations and possible mitigation methods to thwart possible exploitation of such unintended signal channels.",2021.0,2021-05-25,3,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001555747a6afdf31245679a6588240887954691

10.1002/mrm.29906,Current status in spatiotemporal analysis of contrast‐based perfusion MRI,"In perfusion MRI, image voxels form a spatially organized network of systems, all exchanging indicator with their immediate neighbors. Yet the current paradigm for perfusion MRI analysis treats all voxels or regions‐of‐interest as isolated systems supplied by a single global source. This simplification not only leads to long‐recognized systematic errors but also fails to leverage the embedded spatial structure within the data. Since the early 2000s, a variety of models and implementations have been proposed to analyze systems with between‐voxel interactions. In general, this leads to large and connected numerical inverse problems that are intractible with conventional computational methods. With recent advances in machine learning, however, these approaches are becoming practically feasible, opening up the way for a paradigm shift in the approach to perfusion MRI. This paper seeks to review the work in spatiotemporal modelling of perfusion MRI using a coherent, harmonized nomenclature and notation, with clear physical definitions and assumptions. The aim is to introduce clarity in the state‐of‐the‐art of this promising new approach to perfusion MRI, and help to identify gaps of knowledge and priorities for future research.",2023.0,2023-11-06,3,73,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0015dc7c1a56c53b81f2bab77406c862b0384c5d

A case-control study was conducted and included 177 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 173 control subjects to study the involvement of CD36 gene rs1761667 (G>A) and rs1527483 (C>T) polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of T2DM and dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Lipid profile, blood sugar, gender and age were measured and recorded. Also, genotyping analysis for both polymorphisms was performed. Following statistical analysis, 10 different neural networks and machine learning (ML) tools were used to predict subjects with diabetes or dyslipidemia. Towards further understanding of the role of CD36 protein and gene in T2DM and dyslipidemia, a protein-protein interaction network and meta-analysis were carried out. For both polymorphisms, the genotypic frequencies were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). On the other hand, some ML tools like multilayer perceptron gave high prediction accuracy (≥ 0.75) and Cohen’s kappa (κ) (≥ 0.5). Interestingly, in K-star tool, the accuracy and Cohen’s κ values were enhanced by including the genotyping results as inputs (0.73 and 0.46, respectively, compared to 0.67 and 0.34 without including them). This study confirmed, for the first time, that there is no association between CD36 polymorphisms and T2DM or dyslipidemia among Jordanian population.

The previously used linear method, unable to cope with the augmented features, is replaced with a boosting classifier assisted by feature selection. The methods indicated show improved performance for 6 language pairs, when applied on the output from MT systems developed over 7 years. The improved models compete better with reference-aware metrics. Notable conclusions are reached through the examination of the contribution of the features in the models, whereas it is possible to identify common MT errors that are captured by the features. Many grammatical/fluency features have a good contribution, few adequacy features have some contribution, whereas source complexity features are of no use.

Reliable and updated road information thus calls for conventional on-site survey being replaced by more accurate and efficient remote sensing technology. Generally, this approach involves image enhancement and extraction of relevant features, such as elongate gradient and intersecting corners. Thus far, its implication is often impeded by wrongly extraction of other urban peripherals with similar pixel characteristics. This paper therefore proposes the fusion of THEOS satellite image and topographic derivatives, obtained from underlying Digital Surface Models (DSM). Multi-spectral indices in thematic layers and surface properties of designated roads were both fed into state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The results were later fused, taken into account consistently leveled road surface. The proposed technique was thus able to eliminate irrelevant urban structures such as buildings and other constructions, otherwise left by conventional index based extraction. The numerical assessment indicates recall of 84.64%, precision of 97.40% and overall accuracy of 97.78%, with 0.89 Kappa statistics.

Essential aspects towards creating more resilient networks against such attacks include machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data analytics together with AI based detection systems for traffic pattern recognition. Importantly, AI does well in behavioral analysis because it can distinguish and adapt to changing attack vectors. Additionally, it puts AI into perspective as making positive mitigation strategies possible that contain quick interferences such as temporary halt of traffic, rerouting and targeted block listing with real time control panel operations. On the contrary, current DDoS detection prevention techniques remain critically addressed of persistent challenges and limitations fundamental to them. From what emerges, they should always be ready for innovation and improvement because of how attacks might evolve over time. This paper aligns itself with the position that AI-driven detection mechanisms are natural to network security against DDoS attacks. It underlines the importance of integrating AI-based solutions with conventional practices in order to enhance network resilience and efficiently counteract cyber threats that are evolving all the time.",2024.0,2024-04-20,0,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0017097ec9fb7d72967cb7823d7a34ef224cbfc4

In this paper, we present a novel efficient method for thermal and energy management based on bimodal airflow-temperature sensing and reinforcement learning, which expedites an exploration process by self-learning and adjusts action policy only through actuators interacting with the environment, being free of the controlled object model and priori experiences. In general, training of reinforcement learning requires a large amount of data iterations, which takes a long time and is not suitable for real-time control. Here, we propose an approach to speed up the learning process by indicating the action adjustment direction. We adopt tailor-designed bimodal sensors to simultaneously detect airflow and temperature field, which provides comprehensive information for reinforcement learning. The proposed thermal and energy management incorporates bimodal parametric sensing with an improved actor-critic algorithm to realize self-learning control. Experiments of thermal and energy management in a multi-module integrated system validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which demonstrate high efficiency, fast response, and good robustness in various control scenarios. The proposed methodology can be widely applied to thermal and energy management of diverse integrated systems.",2018.0,2018-09-27,6,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001833f130bdc2b1547a3c8896cf1d920dcaab89

As a result, this research examines the rising body of knowledge on social media and crisis management. [1] Between October 2017 and January 2018, a review was conducted, which included locating and retrieving records from an electronic database. The outcomes of this study indicated that the rise of social media has altered the landscape of crisis communication by allowing for greater engagement. However, due to its nature, social media might also be used to spark a crisis. This means that the crisis can be both produced and disseminated through social media. Nonetheless, social media's promise as a crisis-resolution tool is undeniable. It has the capability of proving a claim, dispelling false rumors, or just demonstrating a fact. As a result, practitioners should understand how social media works and how to best use it to interact with their stakeholders. This study also includes other findings, limits, and useful suggestions for scholars and practitioners interested in learning more about the role of social media on crisis communication and management. As most of the crisis problem were reported via twitter. However, most of the problem reported and corresponding responses via twitter were not successfully exchanged between victim’s and resource organization.

10.1088/1361-6560/ab9efc,Improving depth-of-interaction resolution in pixellated PET detectors using neural networks,"Parallax error is a common issue in high-resolution preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) scanners as well as in clinical scanners that have a long axial field of view (FOV), which increases estimation uncertainty of the annihilation position and therefore degrades the spatial resolution. A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction (DOI) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network (NN), as well as a multiple linear regression (MLR)-based method to estimate DOI in depolished PET detector arrays with single-sided readout. The algorithms were tested on an 8× 8 array of 1.53× 1.53× 15 mm3 crystals and a 4× 4 array of 3.1× 3.1× 15 mm3 crystals, both made of Ce:LYSO scintillators and coupled to a 4× 4 array of 3× 3 mm3 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Using the conventional linear DOI estimation method resulted in an average DOI resolution of 3.76 mm and 3.51 mm FWHM for the 8× 8 and the 4× 4 arrays, respectively. Application of MLR outperformed the conventional method with average DOI resolutions of 3.25 mm and 3.33 mm FWHM, respectively. Using the machine learning approaches further improved the DOI resolution, to an average DOI resolution of 2.99 mm and 3.14 mm FWHM, respectively, and additionally improved the uniformity of the DOI resolution in both arrays. Lastly, preliminary results obtained by using only a section of the crystal array for training showed that the NN-based methods could be used to reduce the number of calibration steps required for each detector array.",2020.0,2020-06-22,16,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001a939e1ac64f7280fb08ec7c3e43936ae23f34

10.1371/journal.pone.0142753,miRLocator: Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Mature MicroRNAs within Plant Pre-miRNA Sequences,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding RNA that play regulatory roles in a wide variety of biological processes, such as plant growth and abiotic stress responses. Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. To address the class imbalance problem (few real miRNAs and a large number of pseudo miRNAs), the prediction models in miRLocator were optimized by considering critical (and often ignored) factors that can markedly affect the prediction accuracy of mature miRNAs, including the machine learning algorithm and the ratio between training positive and negative samples. Ten-fold cross-validation on 5854 experimentally validated miRNAs from 19 plant species showed that miRLocator performed better than the state-of-art miRNA predictor miRdup in locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. miRLocator will aid researchers interested in discovering miRNAs from model and non-model plant species.",2015.0,2015-11-11,26,21,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c15accd39827ecf9838d496b7e44e9f890ee7

This study investigated and analyzed particulate matter data from Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Jeollanam-do, with a particular focus on PM2.5. Descriptive statistics, box-and-whisker plots, correlation matrices, time variations, and trend analyses were performed for this purpose. Additionally, a prediction model for PM2.5 concentrations was developed using machine learning techniques, through which future changes in air quality were forecasted. 
Calculations were performed using R-based programs and R packages. Hourly PM2.5 data were obtained from air quality monitoring sites in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon. After data preprocessing, the optimal prediction model was constructed using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine from various machine learning algorithms. 
The research results showed that there was more PM2.5 pollution in Gwangyang compared to Yeosu and Suncheon. The PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly across each monitoring site. Among the monitoring sites, the Yeosu site showed a higher correlation in PM2.5 with each other than other sites. Late winter and early spring showed higher PM2.5 concentrations, while summer and autumn showed lower concentrations. Weekly PM2.5 concentration fluctuations were not significantly different. Daily fluctuations showed an increase in PM2.5 concentrations during times of traffic congestion and a decrease in the afternoon. During the research period, the trend of PM2.5 concentration was generally decreasing. 
The accuracy of the prediction model through machine learning was over 90%, and it is expected to assist in establishing effective response strategies for future changes in air quality.

A postural habit that has been formed cannot be changed easily. It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system.",2018.0,2018-08-01,48,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ca235cae845677c82167c21cbfa9eabddbfbc

10.1371/journal.pone.0272991,Semantic textual similarity for modern standard and dialectal Arabic using transfer learning,"Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is the task of identifying the semantic correlation between two sentences of the same or different languages. STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set.",2022.0,2022-08-11,4,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ce6614288b92f436756e13219135d87cac363
10.3389/fnins.2023.1143239,Neuroimaging mechanisms of acupuncture on functional reorganization for post-stroke motor improvement: a machine learning-based functional magnetic resonance imaging study,"Objective Motor recovery is crucial in stroke rehabilitation, and acupuncture can influence recovery. Neuroimaging and machine learning approaches provide new research directions to explore the brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms after stroke. We applied machine learning to predict the classification of the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for motor improvement and identify the neuroimaging features, in order to explore brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms for motor recovery after stroke. Methods In this study, 49 patients with unilateral motor pathway injury (basal ganglia and/or corona radiata) after ischemic stroke were included and evaluated the motor function by Fugl–Meyer Assessment scores (FMA) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up sessions. Patients were divided by the difference between the twice FMA scores into one group showing minimal clinically important difference (MCID group, n = 28) and the other group with no minimal clinically important difference (N-MCID, n = 21). Machine learning was performed by PRoNTo software to predict the classification of the patients and identify the feature brain regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, a matched group of healthy controls (HC, n = 26) was enrolled. Patients and HC underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination in the resting state and in the acupuncture state (acupuncture at the Yanglingquan point on one side) to compare the differences in brain functional connectivity (FC) and acupuncture effects. Results Through machine learning, we obtained a balance accuracy rate of 75.51% and eight feature ROIs. Compared to HC, we found that the stroke patients with lower FC between these feature ROIs with other brain regions, while patients in the MCID group exhibited a wider range of lower FC. When acupuncture was applied to Yanglingquan (GB 34), the abnormal FC of patients was decreased, with different targets of effects in different groups. Conclusion Feature ROIs identified by machine learning can predict the classification of stroke patients with different motor improvements, and the FC between these ROIs with other brain regions is decreased. Acupuncture can modulate the bilateral cerebral hemispheres to restore abnormal FC via different targets, thereby promoting motor recovery after stroke.

10.1117/1.JBO.29.2.020901,Review of machine learning for optical imaging of burn wound severity assessment,"Abstract. Significance Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms have rapidly become much more widespread for numerous biomedical applications, including the diagnosis and categorization of disease and injury. Aim Here, we seek to characterize the recent growth of ML techniques that use imaging data to classify burn wound severity and report on the accuracies of different approaches. Approach To this end, we present a comprehensive literature review of preclinical and clinical studies using ML techniques to classify the severity of burn wounds. Results The majority of these reports used digital color photographs as input data to the classification algorithms, but recently there has been an increasing prevalence of the use of ML approaches using input data from more advanced optical imaging modalities (e.g., multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography), in addition to multimodal techniques. The classification accuracy of the different methods is reported; it typically ranges from ∼70% to 90% relative to the current gold standard of clinical judgment. Conclusions The field would benefit from systematic analysis of the effects of different input data modalities, training/testing sets, and ML classifiers on the reported accuracy. Despite this current limitation, ML-based algorithms show significant promise for assisting in objectively classifying burn wound severity.",2024.0,2024-02-01,4,85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d71123fef6366ef48e7416a58d08ca2e0542f

10.3390/s23063251,Heart Rate Variability Based Estimation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake in Athletes Using Supervised Regression Models,"Wearable Heart Rate monitors are used in sports to provide physiological insights into athletes’ well-being and performance. Their unobtrusive nature and ability to provide reliable heart rate measurements facilitate the estimation of cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes, as quantified by maximum consumption of oxygen uptake. Previous studies have employed data-driven models which use heart rate information to estimate the cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes. This signifies the physiological relevance of heart rate and heart rate variability for the estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. In this work, the heart rate variability features that were extracted from both exercise and recovery segments were fed to three different Machine Learning models to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of 856 athletes performing Graded Exercise Testing. A total of 101 features from exercise and 30 features from recovery segments were given as input to three feature selection methods to avoid overfitting of the models and to obtain relevant features. This resulted in the increase of model’s accuracy by 5.7% for exercise and 4.3% for recovery. Further, post-modelling analysis was performed to remove the deviant points in two cases, initially in both training and testing and then only in training set, using k-Nearest Neighbour. In the former case, the removal of deviant points led to a reduction of 19.3% and 18.0% in overall estimation error for exercise and recovery, respectively. In the latter case, which mimicked the real-world scenario, the average R value of the models was observed to be 0.72 and 0.70 for exercise and recovery, respectively. From the above experimental approach, the utility of heart rate variability to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of large population of athletes was validated. Additionally, the proposed work contributes to the utility of cardiorespiratory fitness assessment of athletes through wearable heart rate monitors.",2023.0,2023-03-01,2,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d9b4e71b4031ecf7dd4b7bb6e32ac45102eca

However, more knowledge of protein structure-activity correlation is required to improve the efficacy of the drugs targeting GPCRs. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict activation state and activity level of the receptors with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we applied this model to thousands of molecular dynamics trajectories to correlate residue-level conformational changes of a GPCR to its activity level. Finally, the most probable transition pathway between activation states of a receptor can be identified by using the state-activity information. In addition, with this model, we can associate the contribution of each amino acid to the activation process. Using this method we will be able to design drugs that mainly target principal amino acids driving the transition between activation states of GPCRs. Our advanced method is generalizable to all GPCR classes and provides mechanistic insight into the activation mechanism in the receptors.",2022.0,2022-12-20,11,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e0204a8a1af8258ca424fbf534eb2f91243ec

10.3390/genes14091695,Identification of Potential Sex-Specific Biomarkers in Pigs with Low and High Intramuscular Fat Content Using Integrated Bioinformatics and Machine Learning,"Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a key determinant of pork quality. Controlling the genetic and physiological factors of IMF and the expression patterns of various genes is important for regulating the IMF content and improving meat quality in pig breeding. Growing evidence has suggested the role of genetic factors and breeds in IMF deposition; however, research on the sex factors of IMF deposition is still lacking. The present study aimed to identify potential sex-specific biomarkers strongly associated with IMF deposition in low- and high-IMF pig populations. The GSE144780 expression dataset of IMF deposition-related genes were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in male and female low-IMF (162 DEGs, including 64 up- and 98 down-regulated genes) and high-IMF pigs (202 DEGs, including 147 up- and 55 down-regulated genes). Moreover, hub genes were screened via PPI network construction. Furthermore, hub genes were screened for potential sex-specific biomarkers using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator machine learning algorithm, and sex-specific biomarkers in low-IMF (troponin I (TNNI1), myosin light chain 9(MYL9), and serpin family C member 1(SERPINC1)) and high-IMF pigs (CD4 molecule (CD4), CD2 molecule (CD2), and amine oxidase copper-containing 2(AOC2)) were identified, and then verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in semimembranosus muscles. Additionally, the gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of hallmark gene sets were collectively performed on the identified biomarkers. Finally, the transcription factor-biomarker and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (biomarker) networks were predicted. The identified potential sex-specific biomarkers may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of IMF deposition and the beneficial foundation for improving meat quality in pig breeding.",2023.0,2023-08-25,2,81,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e4348bf3ea69ac952c0078282041986cdec3d

Deep Learning can be well prompted in the remote sensing applications especially in perilous military applications. The location of land mines can be detected using a deep learning algorithm design technique aided with distinctive machine learning tools and techniques. The intelligent system designed by the deep learning process involves a massive dataset including the assorted features of the landmines like size, sort, dampness, ground profundity and so on. Incorporation of Geographical Information System can give a prevalent statistical analysis of the varied landmines.

10.3390/rs14112676,Automated Multi-Scale and Multivariate Geological Logging from Drill-Core Hyperspectral Data,"Hyperspectral drill-core scanning adds value to exploration campaigns by providing continuous, high-resolution mineralogical data over the length of entire boreholes. However, multivariate mineralogical data must be transformed into lithological domains such that it is compatible with interpolation techniques and be usable for geomodeling. Manual interpretation of multivariate drill-core data is a challenging, time-consuming and subjective task, and automated or semi-automated approaches are needed. However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection. In this way, the correlation pattern between the variables is incorporated into the segmentation. The scalogram accurately locates the geological boundaries at depth and yields hierarchical geological domains with mineralogical composition characteristics. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a synthetic as well as a real multivariate dataset. The real dataset consists of mineral abundances derived from drill-core hyperspectral imaging data acquired in Elvira, a shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D. Our approach provides an automatic way to transform hyperspectral image-derived mineral maps into vertically coherent geological units that are appropriate inputs for 3D geological modeling workflows. Moreover, the method improves the boundary detection and geological domaining by making use of multivariate information.",2022.0,2022-06-02,13,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e8d27211bfbc49a09b646e6fdfdffb798d8cd

Therefore, the spectral pre-processing method of spectral-to-spectral ratio (S/S), as well as multiple characteristic wavelength member model fusion (MCMF) and characteristic wavelength and non-characteristic wavelength member model fusion (CNCMF) methods, were proposed for improving the detection performance of apple whole fruit SSC by diffuse reflection (DR), diffuse transmission (DT) and full transmission (FT) spectra. The modeling analysis showed that the S/S- partial least squares regression models for all three mode spectra had high prediction performance. After competitive adaptive reweighted sampling characteristic wavelength screening, the prediction performance of all three model spectra was improved. The particle swarm optimization–extreme learning machine models of MCMF and CNCMF had the most significant enhancement effect and could make all three mode spectra have high prediction performance. DR, DT, and FT spectra all had some prediction ability for apple whole fruit SSC, with FT spectra having the strongest prediction ability, followed by DT spectra.

10.1192/bjo.2024.440,Statistical Machine Learning Methods to Handle Missing PHQ-8 Score – Assuming Missing at Random,"Aims Missing data is a challenge that most researchers encounter. It is a concern that continues to be analyzed and addressed for solutions. Missing data occurs when there is no data stored for certain variables relating to participants. In health surveys, when participants answer in the form of “I don't know” or “I'd prefer not to answer”, these responses can, in many cases, be categorized as missing data responses from a participant in a specific category or question. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is an essential tool in healthcare and clinical settings to assess an individual's mental health, specifically related to symptoms of depression. The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with the total score obtained by summing the scores for each item. Higher PHQ-8 scores indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. We used empirical data from a previous study on depression symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease to study the effect of considering the answers “I do not know” and “I prefer not to answer” as missing values when estimating the percentage of depression using PHQ-8. Moreover, we studied the effect of the complete case analysis and multiple imputation on parameter estimates and confidence intervals. The outcome of this study aims to shed light on the development of missing data procedural knowledge and provide methodological support for public health decision-making when data with missing values are collected. Furthermore, this study aims to prevent the exclusion of missing data rather than to generate data. Methods A simulation study with 1000 replicates was performed. Four common statistical machine learning methods for handling missing values were included in this study. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-Means, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest (RF) imputations. Five clusters were used for KNN and K-mean. Likewise, five multiple imputations were used for the CART and RF methods. The simulation was based on publicly available data with available PHQ-8 data for 1096 subjects. In the simulation study and for each replication, multivariate missing values were generated using the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% proportions of missingness. The percent of depression was calculated using the PHQ-8 questionnaire and a comparison was made between estimated actual depression, complete-case analysis, KNN, Kmean, RF, and CART, respectively. Results The Median age of the subjects was 69 (interquartile range: 61–67) and more males (72.9%) than females were included in the data. The estimated actual depression was 16.8, whereas the estimated percentage of depression varies between 6.9–13.5, 16.2–16.7, 16.3–16.7, 16.6–16.7 and 16.7–16.8 for the complete case, KNN, Kmean, RF and CART respectively. Conclusion The results of this simulation study show that missing PHQ-8 data are best handled by applying multiple imputations based on CART or RF. However, using K-Means or KNN leads to a good estimate of the true percentage of depression. Furthermore, the results of this simulation study show that complete-case analysis leads to biased estimates of the true percentage of depression. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to address the problem of missing PHQ-8 data under the assumption of missing not at random.",2024.0,2024-06-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00208549d427e2c8e8e9e33cad0647915314fc3a

It requires manual design features, which consumes manpower and material resources, and identifies crops with a single type, and the results are bad. Therefore, to find an efficient and fast real-time disease image recognition method is very meaningful. Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that can automatically learn representative features to achieve better results in areas of image recognition. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use deep learning methods to identify crop pests and diseases and to find efficient and fast real-time image recognition methods of disease. Deep learning is a newly developed discipline in recent years. Its purpose is to study how to actively obtain a variety of feature representation methods from data samples and rely on data-driven methods, a series of nonlinear transformations are applied to finally collect the original data from specific to abstract, from general to specified semantics, and from low-level to high-level characteristic forms. This paper analyzes the classical and the latest neural network structure based on the theory of deep learning. For the problem that the network based on natural image classification is not suitable for crop pest and disease identification tasks, this paper has improved the network structure that can take care of both recognition speed and recognition accuracy. We discussed the influence of the crop pest and disease feature extraction layer on recognition performance. Finally, we used the inner layer as the main structure to be the pest and disease feature extraction layer by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the inner and global average pooling layers. We analyze various loss functions such as Softmax Loss, Center Loss, and Angular Softmax Loss for pest identification. In view of the shortcomings of difficulty in loss function training, convergence, and operation, making the distance between pests and diseases smaller and the distance between classes more greater improved the loss function and introduced techniques such as feature normalization and weight normalization. The experimental results show that the method can effectively enhance the characteristic expression ability of pests and diseases and thus improve the recognition rate of pests and diseases. Moreover, the method makes the pest identification network training simpler and can improve the pest and disease recognition rate better.",2021.0,2021-10-14,8,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00217041370fbc6f1b5cab5c1642f1a8162d6e6c

10.5194/amt-15-7211-2022,High-fidelity retrieval from instantaneous line-of-sight returns of nacelle-mounted lidar including supervised machine learning,"Abstract. Wind turbine applications that leverage nacelle-mounted
Doppler lidar are hampered by several sources of uncertainty in the lidar
measurement, affecting both bias and random errors. Two problems encountered
especially for nacelle-mounted lidar are solid interference due to
intersection of the line of sight with solid objects behind, within, or in
front of the measurement volume and spectral noise due primarily to
limited photon capture. These two uncertainties, especially that due to
solid interference, can be reduced with high-fidelity retrieval techniques
(i.e., including both quality assurance/quality control and subsequent
parameter estimation). Our work compares three such techniques, including
conventional thresholding, advanced filtering, and a novel application of
supervised machine learning with ensemble neural networks, based on their
ability to reduce uncertainty introduced by the two observed nonideal
spectral features while keeping data availability high. The approach
leverages data from a field experiment involving a continuous-wave (CW)
SpinnerLidar from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) that provided
scans of a wide range of flows both unwaked and waked by a field turbine.
Independent measurements from an adjacent meteorological tower within the
sampling volume permit experimental validation of the instantaneous velocity
uncertainty remaining after retrieval that stems from solid interference and
strong spectral noise, which is a validation that has not been performed
previously. All three methods perform similarly for non-interfered returns,
but the advanced filtering and machine learning techniques perform better
when solid interference is present, which allows them to produce overall
standard deviations of error between 0.2 and 0.3 m s−1, or a 1 %–22 %
improvement versus the conventional thresholding technique, over the rotor
height for the unwaked cases. Between the two improved techniques, the
advanced filtering produces 3.5 % higher overall data availability, while
the machine learning offers a faster runtime (i.e., ∼ 1 s
to evaluate) that is therefore more commensurate with the requirements of
real-time turbine control. The retrieval techniques are described in terms
of application to CW lidar, though they are also relevant to pulsed lidar.
Previous work by the authors (Brown and Herges, 2020) explored a novel
attempt to quantify uncertainty in the output of a high-fidelity lidar
retrieval technique using simulated lidar returns; this article provides
true uncertainty quantification versus independent measurement and does so
for three techniques rather than one.

10.3390/app13095737,Applying the DEMATEL−ANP Fuzzy Comprehensive Model to Evaluate Public Opinion Events,"Network public opinion is a mirror reflecting people’s will, and evaluating its urgency can help to find hidden social crises. Research on public opinion in the field of machine learning usually focuses on micro-sentiment judgment, which is unable to offer support for the evaluation of public opinion events without additional data, and research from the perspective of artificial weighting has the disadvantage of the confusion of explanation. Judging the urgency of public opinion events is usually based on human perception, which is fuzzy and conforms to the attribute of fuzzy mathematics. Therefore, the index system in this paper was constructed in line with five principles, from which the weights were scientifically evaluated by integrating the DEMATEL and ANP model, and fuzzy mathematics was applied to determine the urgency level of public opinion. The result has three-fold significance. First, the index system constructed was more closely linked. Second, the integration of the DEMATEL and ANP weight calculating model took the interdependence of indicators fully into account. Third, fuzzy mathematics provided support for determining the public opinion crisis level, especially in the absence of immediate dissemination data.",2023.0,2023-05-06,3,16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0022e5a46097180bf7c98c038c14d48631acb150

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from proximal sensors and the high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provide an opportunity to monitor the crop water status efficiently. Based on data from an experimental tomato field with intensive aerial and plant-based measurements, we developed random forest machine learning regression models to estimate tomato stem water potential (ψ stem), (using observations from proximal sensors and 12-band UAV imagery, respectively, along with weather data. The proximal sensor-based model estimation agreed well with the plant ψ stem with R 2 of 0.74 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.63 bars. The model included PRI, normalized difference vegetation index, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature and tracked well with the seasonal dynamics of ψ stem across different plots. A separate model, built with multiple vegetation indices (VIs) from UAV imagery and weather variables, had an R 2 of 0.81 and MAE of 0.67 bars. The plant-level ψ stem maps generated from UAV imagery closely represented the water status differences of plots under different irrigation treatments and also tracked well the temporal change among flights. PRI was found to be the most important VI in both the proximal sensor- and the UAV-based models, providing critical information on tomato plant water status. This study demonstrated that machine learning models can accurately estimate the water status by integrating PRI, other VIs, and weather data, and thus facilitate data-driven irrigation management for processing tomatoes.",2023.0,2023-04-06,5,87,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00233edfe560e68440abb54ec536340659c4e1d7

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a washing procedure that guarantees effective and safe cleaning. This organization recommends that States promote this activity and monitor it continuously. Based on this fact, this article presents a work oriented to study the feasibility of identifying the moments in which a person carried out a hand washing, determining its beginning and duration, as well as if these washings were compliant with the WHO guidelines. The identification of washing moments is made through the analysis, by means of Machine Learning techniques, of the data that can be collected from the inertial sensors of the smartwatch the person is wearing. This study was carried out with the participation of 15 volunteers. Data was not only collected in controlled settings but, also, more than 600 hours of sensor measurements come from free-live conditions. The results of the study showed that it is feasible to build a solid solution based on the use of low cost wearables for the identification of washing moments. The solution is very effective (with F1 over 95%) with user-dependent models. Also, with user-independent models, the identification of WHO washings is also very effective (with F1 above 85%), but more limited in the detection of free washings (F1 around 55%).",2021.0,,4,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00238985ff4816a79a13c1c6a7fccfe3661e658a

This study retrospectively investigated newly diagnosed cases of MBNs from our laboratory to investigate mutation landscapes in Chinese patients with MBNs and to combine mutational information and machine learning (ML) into clinical applications for MBNs, especially for subtype classification. Methods Samples from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database were collected for ML model construction and cases from our laboratory were used for ML model validation. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation Random Forest algorithm was used for ML model construction. Mutation detection was performed by NGS and tumor cell size was confirmed by cell morphology and/or flow cytometry in our laboratory. Results Totally 849 newly diagnosed MBN cases from our laboratory were retrospectively identified and included in mutational landscape analyses. Patterns of gene mutations in a variety of MBN subtypes were found, important to investigate tumorigenesis in MBNs. A long list of novel mutations was revealed, valuable to both functional studies and clinical applications. By combining gene mutation information revealed by NGS and ML, we established ML models that provide valuable information for MBN subtype classification. In total, 8895 cases of 8 subtypes of MBNs in the COSMIC database were collected and utilized for ML model construction, and the models were validated on the 849 MBN cases from our laboratory. A series of ML models was constructed in this study, and the most efficient model, with an accuracy of 0.87, was based on integration of NGS testing and tumor cell sizes. Conclusions The ML models were of great significance in the differential diagnosis of all cases and different MBN subtypes.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stage of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this, we proposed a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. In general we have six machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, classifier and feed forward neural network to establish models. In existing system random forest achieved the performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. In proposed system, By analysing the misjudgments generated by the above model, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron which could achieve an efficient accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.

The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease’s onset.

We are trying to shrink this gap by introducing the Evaluation Framework For predicting Efficiency of Cancer Treatment (EFFECT) benchmark suite based on the DepMap and GDSC data sets to facilitate the creation of well-applicable machine learning models capable of predicting gene essentiality and/or drug sensitivity on in vitro cancer cell lines. We show that standard evaluation metrics like Pearson correlation are misleading due to inherent biases in the data. Thus, to assess the performance of models properly, we propose the use of cell line/perturbation exclusive data splits, perturbation-wise evaluation, and the application of our Bias Detector framework, which can identify model predictions not explicable by data bias alone. Testing the EFFECT suite on a few popular machine learning (ML) models showed that while library-standard non-linear models have measurable performance in splits representing precision medicine and target identification tasks, the actual corrected correlations are rather low, showing that even simple knock-out (KO)/drug sensitivity prediction is a yet unsolved task.

However, building a Machine learning model from scratch to classify Thai cultural images can be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data. In this study, we investigate the use of transfer learning for the task of image classification on a dataset of Thai cultural images. We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration. To better understand the reasoning behind the predictions made by the models, we deployed the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique to generate heatmaps that the models attend to when making predictions. Both our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrated that transfer learning is an effective approach to image classification on Thai cultural images.",2023.0,2023-12-01,0,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0026c99e7413ead4a72b6819e15a982ce8c037fd

This is a difficult question that was addressed carefully in a recent paper that focused on the validity of the GRACE score to predict in-hospital mortality. (1) Why is this high-quality study by Mangariello and Gitelman important? Prediction models are increasingly published in the medical literature. Newer methods are proposed, such as labeled machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. Whatever the method of development, the key issue is whether the prediction model or algorithm provides valid predictions for physicians and their patients who rely on them as a source of information and decision making. Indeed, the authors rightly argue that many differences between settings may be present. These include differences in patient characteristics, healthcare systems, and socioeconomic environment. Moreover, treatment may change over time. All these differences may make a previously developed model not valid for the particular setting where the model is applied, for example the Dr. Juan A. Fernández Hospital in Buenos Aires. Therefore, a model may need updating for a specific setting.

This study applied a powerful machine learning algorithm called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to classify sEMG signals acquired from muscles around the knee for distinguishing patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) from healthy subjects. First, to improve data quality, we preprocessed the data via interpolation and normalization. Next, to ensure the description integrity of model input, we extracted nine time-domain features based on the statistical characteristics of sEMG signals over time. Finally, we classified the samples using XGBoost and cross-validation (CV) and compared the results to those produced by the support vector machine (SVM) and the deep neural network (DNN).

Thirty percent of patients do not respond to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Sialylation is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosing CD and predicting anti-TNF medication outcomes in CD. Three potential biomarkers (SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2) were screened using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning based on sialylation-related genes. Moreover, the combined model of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 showed excellent diagnostic value in both the training and validation cohorts. Importantly, a Sial-score was constructed based on the expression of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2. The Sial-low group showed a lower level of immune infiltration than the Sial-high group. Anti-TNF therapy was effective for 94.4% of patients in the Sial-low group but only 15.8% in the Sial-high group. The Sial-score had an outstanding ability to predict and distinguish between responders and non-responders.

10.1029/2022WR032779,"Groundwater Level Forecasting Using Machine Learning: A Case Study of the Baekje Weir in Four Major Rivers Project, South Korea","Understanding the impact of human‐made structures on groundwater levels is essential, with structures like dams or weirs presenting unique challenges and opportunities for study. The Baekje weir in South Korea presents an interesting case as the weir has undergone full gate opening, which is generally not the case for weirs and reservoirs, providing valuable opportunity for simulating weir removal conditions. The main objectives are investigation of groundwater level fluctuations under various weir operations, distances from the weir, and seasonal variations. The study utilizes observed data that simulates conditions with and without the weir, including scenarios of full gate opening. Multiple machine learning algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—are used to develop accurate groundwater level prediction models. The models' performance is assessed using coefficient of determination, Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indices, and visualized through Taylor diagrams. Results indicate that XGBoost outperforms other models in all three groups during both training and testing phases. Specifically, XGBoost surpasses RF by 2.09% (R2), 5.66% (RMSE), and 10.1% (MAE) in training, and outperforms SVR by 11.2% (R2), 42.0% (RMSE), and 129.2% (MAE) in testing. Additionally, the study generates groundwater level maps, providing a practical tool for managing groundwater systems and informing decision‐making in weir operations.

10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2892970,In-Bed Pose Estimation: Deep Learning With Shallow Dataset,"This paper presents a robust human posture and body parts detection method under a specific application scenario known as in-bed pose estimation. Although the human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied extensively in the last few decades, the in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose estimation problems. However, the in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes with specific challenges, including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout the day and having pose distribution different from the common human surveillance viewpoint. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly reduce the effectiveness of the existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge, the infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with the unconventional pose perspective, a 2- end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. The deep learning framework proves to be the most effective model in human pose estimation; however, the lack of large public dataset for in-bed poses prevents us from using a large network from scratch. In this paper, we explored the idea of employing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-tuning the model using our own shallow (limited in size and different in perspective and color) in-bed IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-trained CNN called convolutional pose machine (CPM) was fine-tuned for in-bed pose estimation by re-training its specific intermediate layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.",2017.0,2017-11-03,57,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0027ccaf4960be6b6c3864513eee34b7a9c7b699
10.3390/a15090333,Non-Interactive Decision Trees and Applications with Multi-Bit TFHE,"Machine learning classification algorithms, such as decision trees and random forests, are commonly used in many applications. Clients who want to classify their data send them to a server that performs their inference using a trained model. The client must trust the server and provide the data in plaintext. Moreover, if the classification is done at a third-party cloud service, the model owner also needs to trust the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privately evaluating decision trees. The protocol uses a novel private comparison function based on fully homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) scheme and a programmable bootstrapping technique. Our comparison function for 32-bit and 64-bit integers is 26% faster than the naive TFHE implementation. The protocol is designed to be non-interactive and is less complex than the existing interactive protocols. Our experiment results show that our technique scales linearly with the depth of the decision tree and efficiently evaluates large decision trees on real datasets. Compared with the state of the art, ours is the only non-interactive protocol to evaluate a decision tree with high precision on encrypted parameters.

This study employs computational algorithms to automatically identify and classify features in X‐Ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy images. Principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian mixture (GM) clustering, are implemented to label features on a collection of XRF maps of human atherosclerotic plaque samples. The investigation involves the hard X‐Ray nanoprobe (NanoMAX) at MAX IV synchrotron radiation facility, utilizing scanning transmission X‐Ray microscopy (STXM) and XRF techniques. The analysis covers regions of interest scanned by the beam with a step size of 200 nm, yielding XRF maps of elements like calcium, iron, and zinc. These maps reveal intricate structures unsuitable for manual labeling. However, they can be accurately classified in an automated fashion using GM. Prior to clustering, PCA is used to deal with repeated patterns and background areas. The resulting clusters are associated with different types of features, which can be identified as specific tissues confirmed by histology. Regions of high concentrations of phosphorus, sulfur, calcium, and iron are found in the samples.

Given the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges of employing children, young adults (18–40) can serve as suitable substitutes due to the similarity in their taste sensitivity. Taste panellists need not be experts in sensory evaluation so long as a reference product is used during evaluation; however, they should be screened for bitterness taste detection thresholds. For a more robust evaluation during the developmental phase, considerations of a scoring system and the calculation of an acceptance value may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of recommending a formulation for further development. On the technological front, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be exploited in taste-masking optimisation of medicinal formulations as they can model complex relationships between variables and enable predictions not possible previously to optimise product profiles. Machine learning classifiers may therefore tackle the challenge of predicting the bitterness intensity of paediatric formulations. While advancements have been made, further work is needed to identify effective taste-masking techniques for specific drug molecules. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms, using human panellist acceptability scores, can aid in enhancing paediatric formulation development and overcoming taste-masking challenges.",2023.0,2023-08-01,4,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028a595d2a9cfdd693befc5939764d4d087da6d
10.1371/journal.pone.0177866,Membrane protein contact and structure prediction using co-evolution in conjunction with machine learning,"De novo membrane protein structure prediction is limited to small proteins due to the conformational search space quickly expanding with length. Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid separation)–residue positions distant in sequence, but in close proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL::Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models folded was reduced by an average of 2 Å for a benchmark of 25 membrane proteins.",2017.0,2017-05-24,5,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028cd710f4cbed5a4724a187a088694574af08d
10.2147/JIR.S386714,"Construction of Autophagy-Related Gene Classifier for Early Diagnosis, Prognosis and Predicting Immune Microenvironment Features in Sepsis by Machine Learning Algorithms","Background The immune system plays a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of sepsis, and autophagy and autophagy-related molecules are crucial in innate and adaptive immune responses; however, the potential roles of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in sepsis are not comprehensively understood. Methods A systematic search was conducted in ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts from July 2005 to May 2022. Machine learning approaches, including modified Lasso penalized regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were applied to identify hub ARGs, thereby developing a prediction model termed ARG classifier. Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the model was comprehensively analyzed using multi-transcriptome data. Subsequently, we systematically correlated the ARG classifier/hub ARGs with immunological characteristics of multiple aspects, including immune cell infiltration, immune and molecular pathways, cytokine levels, and immune-related genes. Further, we collected clinical specimens to preliminarily investigate ARG expression levels and to assess the diagnostic performance of ARG classifier. Results A total of ten GEO and three ArrayExpress datasets were included in this study. Based on machine learning algorithms, eight key ARGs (ATG4C, BAX, BIRC5, ERBB2, FKBP1B, HIF1A, NCKAP1, and NFKB1) were integrated to establish ARG classifier. The model exhibited excellent diagnostic values (AUC > 0.85) in multiple datasets and multiple points in time and superiorly distinguished sepsis from other critical illnesses. ARG classifier showed significant correlations with clinical characteristics or endotypes and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.70) than other clinical characteristics. Additionally, the identified hub ARGs were significantly associated with immune cell infiltration (B, T, NK, dendritic, T regulatory, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), immune and molecular pathways (inflammation-promoting pathways, HLA, cytolytic activity, apoptosis, type-II IFN response, complement and coagulation cascades), levels of several cytokines (PDGFRB, IL-10, IFNG, and TNF), which indicated that ARG classifier/hub ARGs adequately reflected the immune microenvironment during sepsis. Finally, using clinical specimens, the expression levels of key ARGs in patients with sepsis were found to differ significantly from those of control patients, and ARG classifier exhibited superior diagnostic performance, compared to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion Collectively, a diagnostic and prognostic model (ARG classifier) based on eight ARGs was developed which may assist clinicians in diagnosis of sepsis and recognizing patient at high risk to guide personalized treatment. Additionally, the ARG classifier effectively reflected the immune microenvironment diversity of sepsis and may facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",2022.0,2022-11-01,15,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028df26e5831b753f7ae8cdafb379cbd4e78165

10.3991/ijim.v16i16.31617,A Novel Approach for Product Recommendation Using Smartphone Sensor Data,"Human Activity-based studies have become an omnipresent research topic in Machine Learning. Considering the countless impacts of human activity on persons' everyday life, we have analyzed the correlation between human activity and their product preferences in our study and proposed that daily human activity could be a metric for product recommendation models. To address this previously unaccounted phenomenon, a new approach is presented in our study that gives real-time recommendations to users by observing their activeness in daily life. However, product recommendation systems mostly believe in ratings, and the purchase behavior of users instead of investigating the precious insights of users' daily activities. But we examined smartphones' GPS sensor data using machine learning algorithms to urge insights from users' daily activeness and proposed a model for predicting the product of interest of the purchasers, based on the activeness of their daily life. Moreover, based on our model, we have introduced a prototype of a real-time recommendation system, especially for the retail shops that rely on users' implicit data from smartphone sensors to form product recommendations. For conducting our study, we developed an android application that—collects embedded smartphone sensor data and can detect objects to provide product recommendations and product details. Experiment shows, that our proffered daily activeness-based recommendation system using smartphone sensor data, performs with a precision of 66%, but it is also a promising performance because it does not use customers' explicit feedback.",2022.0,2022-08-31,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0029b6d7f583e0705d1cb9dc16a33bb12a995ad6

However finding effective solution to these problems has been rendered difficult. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents an analytical Machine learning model that suitably combined the graph signature with random forest techniques. This study presents the design and realization of a novel Intelligent Citizenship Identity through family pedigree using Graph Signature based random forest (GSB-RF) model. The study also showcases the development of a novel graph signature technique referred to as Canonical Code Signature(CCS) method. The CCS method is used at the pre-processing stage of the identification process to build signature for any given tuple. Performance comparisim between the present system and the baseline techniques which includes: the K-Nearest Neighbour and the traditional Random Forest shows that the present system outperformed the baseline method studied. The proposed system shows capability to perform continuous re-identification of Citizens based on their family pedigree with ability to select best sample with low computational complexity, high identification accuracy and speed. Our experimental result shows that the precision rate and identification quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%. Therefore, the proposed Citizenship Identification machine is capable of providing usable, consistent, efficient, faster and accurate identification, to the users, security agents, government agents and institutions on-line, real-time and at any-time.Keywords- Canonical code,Citizenship Identity, Family pedigree,Graph-Signature,Machine learning, Random-forest",2021.0,2021-06-29,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002a1faea8e778716839dfae54dbd1d2ca54f1df

10.1371/journal.pone.0283933,Application of quantum computing to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model for novel medical knowledge discovery,"Recently, the utilization of real-world medical data collected from clinical sites has been attracting attention. Especially as the number of variables in real-world medical data increases, causal discovery becomes more and more effective. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop new causal discovery algorithms suitable for small data sets for situations where sample sizes are insufficient to detect reasonable causal relationships, such as rare diseases and emerging infectious diseases. This study aims to develop a new causal discovery algorithm suitable for a small number of real-world medical data using quantum computing, one of the emerging information technologies attracting attention for its application in machine learning. In this study, a new algorithm that applies the quantum kernel to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, one of the causal discovery algorithms, is developed. Experiments on several artificial data sets showed that the new algorithm proposed in this study was more accurate than existing methods with the Gaussian kernel under various conditions in the low-data regime. When the new algorithm was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which the causal structure could be correctly estimated even when the amount of data was small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing the new algorithm on real quantum hardware was discussed. This study suggests that the new proposed algorithm using quantum computing might be a good choice among the causal discovery algorithms in the low-data regime for novel medical knowledge discovery.",2021.0,2021-10-09,7,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002acb7f6823d4b486a6865b18238c2fcc520333

10.1049/ntw2.12098,Evaluating the impact of generative adversarial models on the performance of anomaly intrusion detection,"With the increasing rate and types of cyber attacks against information systems and communication infrastructures, many tools are needed to detect and mitigate against such attacks, for example, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Unfortunately, traditional Signature‐based IDSs (SIDSs) perform poorly against previously unseen adversarial attacks. Anomaly‐based IDSs (AIDSs) use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to overcome these limitations. However, AIDS performance can be poor when trained on imbalanced datasets. To address the challenge of AIDS performance caused by these unbalanced training datasets, generative adversarial models are proposed to obtain adversarial attacks from one side and analyse their quality from another. According to extensive usage and reliability criteria for generative adversarial models in different disciplines, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) are employed to serve AIDS. The authors have extensively assessed their abilities and robustness to deliver high‐quality attacks for AIDS. AIDSs are constructed, trained, and tuned based on these models to measure their impacts. The authors have employed two datasets: NSL‐KDD and CICIDS‐2017 for generalisation purposes, where ML and DL approaches are utilised to implement AIDSs. Their results show that the WGAN model outperformed GANs and BiGAN models in binary and multiclass classifications for both datasets.",2023.0,2023-08-28,6,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002af81e9c2ec4361890465809ecdd1dabcaae18

Our system uses a dual Doppler radar mounted onto a restroom ceiling and wall. Machine learning methods, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, support vector machine, and random forest methods, are applied to the Doppler radar data to verify the model’s efficiency and features. Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom. These findings indicate that daily restroom monitoring using the proposed radar system accurately recognizes human behaviors and allows early detection of fall accidents.",2022.0,2022-02-22,18,41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002b5b830c6c7f312dd82cf936b6204bd4018de6

Methods After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. Results This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm explains the individualized predictions. Conclusions In conclusion, our study accomplished the successful development and validation of ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with CHF combined with CKD. Notably, the XGBoost model emerged as the most efficacious among all the ML models employed.",2024.0,2024-02-15,6,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002bec1532344bccbeb644a82dd58bcecab22bdc

It creates an adverse impact on flyrock. Thus, it is essential to forecast flyrock to minimize the environmental effects. The objective of this study is to forecast/estimate the amount of flyrock produced during blasting by applying three creative composite intelligent models: equilibrium optimizer-coupled extreme learning machine (EO-ELM), particle swarm optimization-based extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). To obtain a successful conclusion, we considered 114 blasting data parameters consisting of eight inputs (hole diameter, burden, stemming length, rock density, charge-per-meter, powder factor (PF), blastability index (BI), and weathering index), and one output parameter (flyrock distance). We then compared the results of different models using seven different performance indices. Every predictive model accomplished the results comparable with the measured values of flyrock. To show the effectiveness of the developed EO-ELM, the result from each model run 10-times is compared. The average result shows that the EO-ELM model in testing (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 32.14, MAE = 19.78, MAPE = 20.37, NSE = 0.93, VAF = 93.97, A20 = 0.57) achieved a better performance as compared to the PSO-ANN model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 64.44, MAE = 36.02, MAPE = 29.96, NSE = 0.72, VAF = 74.72, A20 = 0.33) and PSO-ELM model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 48.55, MAE = 26.97, MAPE = 26.71, NSE = 0.84, VAF = 84.84, A20 = 0.51).

10.3390/ATMOS10050252,Prediction of North Atlantic Oscillation Index with Convolutional LSTM Based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition,"The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the most significant mode of the atmosphere in the North Atlantic, and it plays an important role in regulating the local weather and climate and even those of the entire Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, it is vital to predict NAO events. Since the NAO event can be quantified by the NAO index, an effective neural network model EEMD-ConvLSTM, which is based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), is proposed for NAO index prediction in this paper. EEMD is applied to preprocess NAO index data, which are issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NAO index data are decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). After being filtered by the energy threshold, the remaining IMFs are used to reconstruct new NAO index data as the input of ConvLSTM. In order to evaluate the performance of EEMD-ConvLSTM, six methods were selected as the benchmark, which included traditional models, machine learning algorithms, and other deep neural networks. Furthermore, we forecast the NAO index with EEMD-ConvLSTM and the Rolling Forecast (RF) and compared the results with those of Global Forecast System (GFS) and the averaging of 11 Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model ensemble members (ENSM) provided by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. The experimental results show that EEMD-ConvLSTM not only has the highest reliability from evaluation metrics, but also can better capture the variation trend of the NAO index data.",2019.0,2019-05-07,27,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003039ed86a5d6d9af3ef164e106752b3ec51820

10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3196018,Combining Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional and Graph Convolutional Networks to Detect Phishing Sites Using URL and HTML,"Phishing, a well-known cyber-attack practice has gained significant research attention in the cyber-security domain for the last two decades due to its dynamic attacking strategies. Although different solutions have been exercised against phishing, phishing attacks have dramatically increased in the past few years. Recent studies have shown that machine learning has become prominent in the present anti-phishing context, and the techniques like deep learning have extensively improved anti-phishing tools’ detection ability. This paper proposes PhishDet, a new way of detecting phishing websites through Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network and Graph Convolutional Network using URL and HTML features. PhishDet is the first of its kind, which uses the powerful analysis and processing capabilities of Graph Neural Network in the anti-phishing domain and recorded 96.42% detection accuracy, with a 0.036 false-negative rate. It is effective against zero-day attacks, and the average detection time which is 1.8 seconds could also be considered realistic. The feature selection of PhishDet is automatic and occurs inside the system, as PhishDet gradually learns URLs and HTML content features to handle constantly changing phishing attacks. This has outperformed similar solutions by achieving a 99.53% f1-score with a public benchmark dataset. However, PhishDet requires periodic retraining to maintain its performance over time. If such retraining could be facilitated, PhishDet could fight against phishers for a more extended period to safeguard Internet users from this Internet threat.",2022.0,,23,70,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0031e9cbc9568967755617493f525eb852baad2b

10.3390/app13116639,"Analysis of the Composition of Ancient Glass and Its Identification Based on the Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM and MLR Combined Process","The glass relics are precious material evidence of the early trade and cultural exchange between the East and the West. To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit. In comparison with other similar types of models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF), the classification accuracy of JMLA is 97.9% on the train set. The accuracy rate on the test set reached 97.6%. The results of the research demonstrate that JMLA can improve the accuracy of the glass type classification problem, greatly enhance the research efficiency of archaeological staff, and gain a more reliable result.",2023.0,2023-05-30,4,70,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0032ae42a28ed484aa7440742767b0e9e9a7dcff
10.3390/app12042160,A Resource Utilization Prediction Model for Cloud Data Centers Using Evolutionary Algorithms and Machine Learning Techniques,"Cloud computing has revolutionized the modes of computing. With huge success and diverse benefits, the paradigm faces several challenges as well. Power consumption, dynamic resource scaling, and over- and under-provisioning issues are challenges for the cloud computing paradigm. The research has been carried out in cloud computing for resource utilization prediction to overcome over- and under-provisioning issues. Over-provisioning of resources consumes more energy and leads to high costs. However, under-provisioning induces Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and Quality of Service (QoS) degradation. Most of the existing mechanisms focus on single resource utilization prediction, such as memory, CPU, storage, network, or servers allocated to cloud applications but overlook the correlation among resources. This research focuses on multi-resource utilization prediction using Functional Link Neural Network (FLNN) with hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

10.1371/journal.pone.0286311,Machine learning based canine posture estimation using inertial data,"The aim of this study was to design a new canine posture estimation system specifically for working dogs. The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs’ chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed. The dataset and code used are publicly available on Mendeley Data and GitHub, respectively.",2023.0,2023-06-21,8,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00342ad7d5b47a585e1d802cabb2837d0c05c9a6
10.1017/s1759078724000965,"Neural networks empowered: a machine learning-enabled, Gyro mmID for enhanced virtual reality and motion tracking applications","
 With the emerging developments in millimeter-wave/5G technologies, the potential for wireless Internet of things devices to achieve widespread sensing, precise localization, and high data-rate communication systems becomes increasingly viable. The surge in interest surrounding virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies is attributed to the vast array of applications they enable, ranging from surgical training to motion capture and daily interactions in VR spaces. To further elevate the user experience, and real-time and accurate orientation detection of the user, the authors proposes the utilization of a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system coupled with an ultra-low-power, sticker-like millimeter-wave identification (mmID). The mmID features four backscattering elements, multiplexed in amplitude, frequency, and spatial domains. This design utilizes the training of a supervised learning classification convolutional neural network, enabling accurate real-time three-axis orientation detection of the user. The proposed orientation detection system exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 90.58% over three axes at a distance of 8 m. This high accuracy underscores the precision of the orientation detection system, particularly tailored for medium-range VR/AR applications. The integration of the FMCW-based mmID system with machine learning proves to be a promising advancement, contributing to the seamless and immersive interaction within virtual and augmented environments.",2024.0,2024-11-13,0,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00342bbadd38eb967ed257d8567b540d7270efa0

10.1371/journal.pone.0255277,Predicting pain among female survivors of recent interpersonal violence: A proof-of-concept machine-learning approach,"Interpersonal violence (IPV) is highly prevalent in the United States and is a major public health problem. The emergence and/or worsening of chronic pain are known sequelae of IPV; however, not all those who experience IPV develop chronic pain. To mitigate its development, it is critical to identify the factors that are associated with increased risk of pain after IPV. This proof-of-concept study used machine-learning strategies to predict pain severity and interference in 47 young women, ages 18 to 30, who experienced an incident of IPV (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) within three months of their baseline assessment. Young women are more likely than men to experience IPV and to subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Women completed a comprehensive assessment of theory-driven cognitive and neurobiological predictors of pain severity and pain-related interference (e.g., pain, coping, disability, psychiatric diagnosis/symptoms, PTSD/trauma, executive function, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress response). Gradient boosting machine models were used to predict symptoms of pain severity and pain-related interference across time (Baseline, 1-,3-,6- follow-up assessments). Models showed excellent predictive performance for pain severity and adequate predictive performance for pain-related interference. This proof-of-concept study suggests that machine-learning approaches are a useful tool for identifying predictors of pain development in survivors of recent IPV. Baseline measures of pain, family life impairment, neuropsychological function, and trauma history were of greatest importance in predicting pain and pain-related interference across a 6-month follow-up period. Present findings support the use of machine-learning techniques in larger studies of post-IPV pain development and highlight theory-driven predictors that could inform the development of targeted early intervention programs. However, these results should be replicated in a larger dataset with lower levels of missing data.",2021.0,2021-07-29,5,90,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0035763f80fd126ad0d99dd1b964dae9c1986d39

10.1155/vmi/5585458,Machine Learning Techniques Associated With Infrared Thermography to Optimize the Diagnosis of Bovine Subclinical Mastitis,"Bovine subclinical mastitis (SCM) is the costliest disease for the dairy industry. Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14 months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000 cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables.

10.7759/cureus.42668,Predictive Factors for High Post-void Residual Volume in Older Females After OnabotulinumA Treatment for Severe Overactive Bladder Using a Machine Learning Model,"Introduction Intravesical onabotulinumA injection is actively used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume. The findings contribute to our understanding of onabotulinumA injection treatment for OAB and support evidence-based decision-making using readily available information.",2023.0,2023-07-01,4,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003653221d742282482d1a3df6927f69763b47aa

Research on cancer and anticancer therapy is constantly looking for new hints to improve the response to therapy while reducing the risk of relapse. In this scenario, the gut microbiome and the plethora of microbial-derived metabolites are considered a new opening in the development of innovative anticancer treatments for a better prognosis. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiome in the onset and progression of cancer, as well as in response to chemo-immunotherapy. Recent findings regarding the tumor microbiome and its implications for clinical practice are also commented on. Current microbiome-based intervention strategies (i.e., prebiotics, probiotics, live biotherapeutics and fecal microbiota transplantation) are then discussed, along with key shortcomings, including a lack of long-term safety information in patients who are already severely compromised by standard treatments.

The method does not require the 3D structure of the corresponding protein, but only its sequence and, thus, can be applied on genome-scale investigations where structural information is very sparse. SAAFEC-SEQ uses physicochemical properties, sequence features, and evolutionary information features to make the predictions. It is shown to consistently outperform all existing state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and root-mean-squared-error parameters as benchmarked on several independent datasets.

Although formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are deemed crucial for research and clinical applications, the fixation process results in molecular damage to nucleic acids, thus confounding their use in genome sequence analysis. Methods to improve genomic data quality from FFPE tissues have emerged, but there remains significant room for improvement.

However, some of these algorithms are inscrutable, namely, they produce predictions that humans cannot understand or explain. This trait is in tension with the emphasis on reason‐giving in administrative law. The article explores this tension, advancing two interrelated arguments. First, providing adequate reasons is a significant facet of respecting individuals’ agency. Incorporating inscrutable algorithmic predictions into administrative decision‐making compromises this normative ideal. Second, as a long‐term concern, the use of inscrutable algorithms by administrative agencies may generate systemic effects by gradually reducing the realm of the humanly explainable in public life, a phenomenon Max Weber termed ‘re‐enchantment’. As a result, the use of inscrutable machine learning algorithms might trigger a special kind of re‐enchantment, making us comprehend less rather than more of shared human experience, and consequently altering the way we understand the administrative state and experience public life.",2023.0,2023-10-08,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003ac96deaefc09dee4446f9c10554fb09f6fba7

The Jucazinho Dam, built in 1998, emerged as a response to the scarcity of water in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil. After having less than 1% of its water storage capacity in 2016, the dam recovered in 2020 after interventions by the local water utility. In this context, the reliability of influent flow prediction models for dams becomes crucial for managers. This study proposed hydrological models based on artificial intelligence that aim to generate flow series, and we evaluated the adaptability of these models for the operation of the Jucazinho Dam. Data normalization between 0 and 1 was applied to avoid the predominance of variables with high values. The model was based on machine learning and employed support vector regression (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), as provided by the Python Sklearn library. The selection of the monitoring stations took place via the Brazilian National Water and Sanitation Agency’s (ANA) HIDROWEB portal, and we used Spearman’s correlation to identify the relationship between precipitation and flow. The evaluation of the performance of the model involved graphical analyses and statistical criteria such as the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the percentage of bias (PBIAS), the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean standard deviation ratio (RSR). The results of the statistical coefficients for the test data indicated unsatisfactory performance for long-term predictions (8, 16 and 32 days ahead), revealing a downward trend in the quality of the fit with an increase in the forecast horizon. The SVM model stood out by obtaining the best indices of NSE, PBIAS, R2 and RSR. The graphical results of the SVM models showed underestimation of the flow values with an increase in the forecast horizon due to the sensitivity of the SVM to complex patterns in the time series. On the other hand, the RF and ANN models showed hyperestimation of the flow values as the number of forecast days increased, which was mainly attributed to overfitting. In summary, this study highlights the relevance of artificial intelligence in flow prediction for the efficient management of dams, especially in water scarcity and data-scarce scenarios. A proper choice of models and the ensuring of reliable input data are crucial for obtaining accurate forecasts and can contribute to water security and the effective operation of dams such as Jucazinho.",2024.0,2024-07-04,2,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003b1449565f0afd675b7fb59f35693776eb2c77

Machine learning can be used in many applications such as face detection, speech recognition, medical diagnostics, statistical arbitrage, traffic prediction, etc. The traffic environment includes everything that can affect traffic on the road, whether it is traffic lights, accidents, rallies, or even road repairs that can cause congestion. If we have preconceived information very close to all of the above and the many everyday situations that can affect traffic, the driver or passenger can make an informed decision. It also helps with the future of automotive vehicles. In the present decades, traffic data has been massively generated, and we have moved towards big data concepts for transportation. The to be had site visitors glide forecasting strategies use a few site visitors’ prediction fashions and are nonetheless unsatisfactory to address real-global applications. It is lumbering to figure out the traffic flow precisely since the information accessible for the transportation framework is madly colossal. In this work, we arranged to utilize machine learning, genetic, soft computing, and deep learning algorithms to analyse the big-data for the transportation system with much-reduced complexity. Moreover, Image Processing algorithms are included in traffic sign recognition, which inevitably helps for the right training of autonomous vehicles. In economic years, Mobility GPS has become very popular in big cities in determining traffic percentage with the help of centralized traffic - server management.

Alternative methods based on wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated from these types of devices. Objective This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable estimate of caloric intake. Methods The study will capture four individual eating activities outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email, flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the University of Padova. Results The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high accuracy. Conclusions Building an automatic calculation method for caloric intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg, for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different segments of the population.

Due to the limitations of current diagnostic tools in these cases, novel approaches must be brought forward to improve treatment outcomes for these patients. The objective of this study was to develop a machine-learning-based software for primary cancer site prediction (OncoOrigin), based on genetic data acquired from tumor DNA sequencing. By design, this was an in silico diagnostic study, conducted using data from the cBioPortal database (accessed on 21 September 2024) and several data processing and machine learning Python libraries. The study involved over 20,000 tumor samples with information on patient age, sex, and the presence of genetic variants in over 600 genes. The main outcome of interest was machine-learning-based discrimination between cancer site classes. Model quality was assessed by training set cross-validation and evaluation on a segregated test set. Finally, the optimal model was incorporated with a graphical user interface into the OncoOrigin software. Feature importance for class discrimination was also determined on the optimal model. Out of the four tested machine learning estimators, the XGBoostClassifier-based model proved superior in test set evaluation, with a top-2 accuracy of 0.91 and ROC-AUC of 0.97. Unlike other machine learning models published in the literature, OncoOrigin stands out as the only one integrated with a graphical user interface, which is crucial for facilitating its use by oncology specialists in everyday clinical practice, where its application and implementation will have the greatest value in the future.",2025.0,2025-03-13,0,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003dd92c1fc602f1a33ace4320efed179324a88b

Despite the growing knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction and ulcerative colitis (UC), the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in UC remains to be fully explored. Methods We integrated 1137 UC colon mucosal samples from 12 multicenter cohorts worldwide to create a normalized compendium. Differentially expressed mitochondria-related genes (DE-MiRGs) in individuals with UC were identified using the “Limma” R package. Unsupervised consensus clustering was utilized to determine the intrinsic subtypes of UC driven by DE-MiRGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to investigate module genes related to UC. Four machine learning algorithms were utilized for screening DE-MiRGs in UC and construct MiRGs diagnostic models. The models were developed utilizing the over-sampled training cohort, followed by validation in both the internal test cohort and the external validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Xcell and CIBERSORT algorithms, while potential biological mechanisms were explored through GSVA and GSEA algorithms. Hub genes were selected using the PPI network. Results The study identified 108 DE-MiRGs in the colonic mucosa of patients with UC compared to healthy controls, showing significant enrichment in pathways associated with mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation. The MiRGs diagnostic models for UC were constructed based on 17 signature genes identified through various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities. Utilizing the identified DE-MiRGs from the normalized compendium, 941 patients with UC were stratified into three subtypes characterized by distinct cellular and molecular profiles. Specifically, the metabolic subtype demonstrated enrichment in epithelial cells, the immune-inflamed subtype displayed high enrichment in antigen-presenting cells and pathways related to pro-inflammatory activation, and the transitional subtype exhibited moderate activation across all signaling pathways. Importantly, the immune-inflamed subtype exhibited a stronger correlation with superior response to four biologics: infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and golimumab compared to the metabolic subtype. Conclusion This analysis unveils the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune microenvironment in UC, thereby offering novel perspectives on the potential pathogenesis of UC and precision treatment of UC patients, and identifying new therapeutic targets.",2024.0,2024-07-04,1,77,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e31ab99c90e5720ecd5fd6d74e672b887876c

10.3389/fnhum.2023.1150120,Pre-trained deep learning models for brain MRI image classification,"Brain tumors are serious conditions caused by uncontrolled and abnormal cell division. Tumors can have devastating implications if not accurately and promptly detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the methods frequently used to detect brain tumors owing to its excellent resolution. In the past few decades, substantial research has been conducted in the field of classifying brain images, ranging from traditional methods to deep-learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). To accomplish classification, machine-learning methods require manually created features. In contrast, CNN achieves classification by extracting visual features from unprocessed images. The size of the training dataset had a significant impact on the features that CNN extracts. The CNN tends to overfit when its size is small. Deep CNNs (DCNN) with transfer learning have therefore been developed. The aim of this work was to investigate the brain MR image categorization potential of pre-trained DCNN VGG-19, VGG-16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 models using data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Validation of the test set utilizing accuracy, recall, Precision, and F1 score showed that the pre-trained VGG-19 model with transfer learning exhibited the best performance. In addition, these methods offer an end-to-end classification of raw images without the need for manual attribute extraction.",2023.0,2023-04-20,44,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003f528634735ece46286609f6a074fbfa435722

Despite its widespread use across various fields, the extreme learning machine (ELM) also suffers from multicollinearity issues. To address this challenge, the ridge and Liu estimators, drawn from statistics literature, have been integrated into ELM theory, resulting in a notable advancement. This study aims to further enhance the capabilities of ridge and Liu estimators within the ELM framework by introducing two innovative two-parameter algorithms (TP1-ELM and TP2-ELM) that simultaneously incorporate both estimators. The proposed algorithms undergo comprehensive benchmarking against ELM, ELM-based algorithms, and other commonly used machine learning techniques across seven diverse datasets. Benchmark results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform both ELM-focused approaches and traditional machine learning algorithms on most datasets, yielding more generalizable and stable results.

10.3390/s21144770,Unsupervised Assessment of Balance and Falls Risk Using a Smartphone and Machine Learning,"Assessment of health and physical function using smartphones (mHealth) has enormous potential due to the ubiquity of smartphones and their potential to provide low cost, scalable access to care as well as frequent, objective measurements, outside of clinical environments. Validation of the algorithms and outcome measures used by mHealth apps is of paramount importance, as poorly validated apps have been found to be harmful to patients. Falls are a complex, common and costly problem in the older adult population. Deficits in balance and postural control are strongly associated with falls risk. Assessment of balance and falls risk using a validated smartphone app may lessen the need for clinical assessments which can be expensive, requiring non-portable equipment and specialist expertise. This study reports results for the real-world deployment of a smartphone app for self-directed, unsupervised assessment of balance and falls risk. The app relies on a previously validated algorithm for assessment of balance and falls risk; the outcome measures employed were trained prior to deployment on an independent data set. Results for a sample of 594 smartphone assessments from 147 unique phones show a strong association between self-reported falls history and the falls risk and balance impairment scores produced by the app, suggesting they may be clinically useful outcome measures. In addition, analysis of the quantitative balance features produced seems to suggest that unsupervised, self-directed assessment of balance in the home is feasible.",2021.0,2021-07-01,20,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003fd4c1c8b370de0be5eca6068604dbf8c46a62

As the sophistication of malware continues to increase, the demand for innovative approaches to improve detection capabilities become paramount. Machine learning/Deep learning models are being increasingly used for Malware Detection, however one of the most important and frequently overlooked aspects of building such models is feature encoding. This research paper explores the importance of feature encoding to improve the efficiency of threat detection and proposes a novel entropy-based encoding scheme for the categorical features present in the data extracted from malicious inputs. The KDDCUP99, UNSW-NB15 and CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 datasets have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encoding scheme. The results of the proposed encoding scheme are validated against seven other encoding schemes to ascertain the credibility and usability of the proposed scheme. The efficiency of the proposed system evaluated by applying different encoded versions of the datasets to train various machine learning models and determining the classification performance of the models on each dataset. The machine learning models trained with the proposed encoding scheme produced stable classification results and outperformed other encoding schemes when dimensionality reduction was applied on the data. The ensemble classifier trained using the proposed scheme was able to classify the data with an F1 score of 99.99% when the dimension-reduced entropy-encoded KDD Cup99 dataset was used to build the model. On the CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 dataset, the entropy encoding has exhibited a slightly improved classification parameters with the ensemble methods yielding a peak F1 score of 99.27%. We have also determined the feature importance values of the features present in the datasets to study the change in the contribution levels of the features when multiple categorical encoding schemes are applied upon the data.",2024.0,,0,102,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00400e2514bc0e41323ddf7beb1bec5ab2516b82

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074559,From Big Data to Deep Data to Support People Analytics for Employee Attrition Prediction,"In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking ‘big’ by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking ‘deep’ by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that ‘business travel’, which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.",2021.0,,48,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0040fbc24133d560c7de163f4bd7a32e07f9fd1e

This article, though, sheds some light on the actual differences that can be seen in how men and women drive. In this study, GPS-recorded driving dynamics data from 123 drivers, 48 women and 75 men, are analysed and drivers are categorised as aggressive, normal or gentle. A total of 10% of the drivers was categorised as aggressive, with an even distribution between the genders. For the gentle drivers, 11% of the drivers, the men dominated. The driving style investigation was extended to utilise machine learning, confirming the results from statistical tools. As driving style highly impacts a vehicle’s fuel consumption, while switching over to battery electric vehicles it is important to investigate how the different driving styles impact battery utilisation. Two Li-ion battery cell types were tested utilising the same load cycle with three levels of current amplitude, to represent accelerations for the three drive categories. While one cell type was insensitive to the current amplitude, the highly energy-optimised cell proved to be sensitive to higher current amplitudes, corresponding to a more aggressive driving style. Thus, the amplitude of the dynamic current can for some cells be a factor that needs to be considered for lifetime predictions, while it can be neglected for other cells.",2022.0,2022-09-16,5,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0042c8b6e5e509c1b19eca934fe8bb01a16c1d7a

This study explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and citizen engagement in improving road safety for vulnerable populations (pedestrians, cyclists) in Genoa, Italy. Aligned with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the project aims for a 50% reduction in traffic accidents by 2030.The AI4PublicPolicy initiative introduces the Virtual Policy Management Environment (VPME) platform. VPME utilizes ML, Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and chatbots to empower the policy development lifecycle. Citizen feedback is integrated through workshops and surveys, fostering a citizen-centric approach. The Genoa pilot program demonstrates VPME's capabilities. ML models analyse historical accident and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to predict future high-risk areas. These predictions inform resource allocation and targeted interventions for pedestrian crossings and school walking routes (""Pedibus""). Dashboards visualize the model outputs, allowing users to assess risk levels and predict accident occurrences. Future improvements include incorporating additional data sources (demographics, real-time traffic) for enhanced model accuracy. Citizen engagement played a vital role. Co-creation workshops facilitated stakeholder participation in defining Use Cases, User Stories, and project objectives. Discussions focused on integrating data from environmental, traffic, and citizen reporting systems with VPME solutions. Participants evaluated the project approach and provided valuable feedback. The project highlights the potential of AI and citizen collaboration for data-driven policymaking. This approach empowers municipalities to make informed decisions that prioritize public safety and well-being.

10.2196/50935,Evaluation of a Natural Language Processing Approach to Identify Diagnostic Errors and Analysis of Safety Learning System Case Review Data: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND
Diagnostic errors are an underappreciated cause of preventable mortality in hospitals and pose a risk for severe patient harm and increase hospital length of stay.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to explore the potential of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in improving diagnostic safety surveillance. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of the feasibility and potential to use electronic health records clinical notes and existing case review data.


METHODS
Safety Learning System case review data from 1 large health system composed of 10 hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from February 2016 to September 2021 were analyzed. The case review outcome included opportunities for improvement including diagnostic opportunities for improvement. To supplement case review data, electronic health record clinical notes were extracted and analyzed. A simple logistic regression model along with 3 forms of logistic regression models (ie, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Ridge, and Elastic Net) with regularization functions was trained on this data to compare classification performances in classifying patients who experienced diagnostic errors during hospitalization. Further, statistical tests were conducted to find significant differences between female and male patients who experienced diagnostic errors.


RESULTS
In total, 126 (7.4%) patients (of 1704) had been identified by case reviewers as having experienced at least 1 diagnostic error. Patients who had experienced diagnostic error were grouped by sex: 59 (7.1%) of the 830 women and 67 (7.7%) of the 874 men. Among the patients who experienced a diagnostic error, female patients were older (median 72, IQR 66-80 vs median 67, IQR 57-76; P=.02), had higher rates of being admitted through general or internal medicine (69.5% vs 47.8%; P=.01), lower rates of cardiovascular-related admitted diagnosis (11.9% vs 28.4%; P=.02), and lower rates of being admitted through neurology department (2.3% vs 13.4%; P=.04). The Ridge model achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.885), specificity (0.797), positive predictive value (PPV; 0.24), and F1-score (0.369) in classifying patients who were at higher risk of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing can be a potential solution to more effectively identifying and selecting potential diagnostic error cases for review and therefore reducing the case review burden.",2024.0,2024-08-26,1,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004442d02b543868c4c89d52ed038aff794f6108
10.17762/ijritcc.v11i5.6523,Remote Health Monitoring IoT Framework using Machine Learning Prediction and Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) Model,"Real intervention and treatment standards drew attention to remote health monitoring frameworks. Remote monitoring frameworks for disease detection at an early stage are opposed by most conventional works. Even so, it ran into issues like increased operational complexity, higher resource costs, inaccurate predictions, longer data collection times, and a lower convergence rate. A remote health monitoring framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict heart disease and diabetes from medical datasets is the goal of this project. Patients' health data is collected via smart devices, and the resulting data is then combined using a variety of nodes, including a detection node, a visualisation node, and a prognostic node. People with long-term illnesses (such as the elderly and disabled) are in such greater demand than ever before that a new approach to healthcare delivery is essential. In the evolved paradigm, conventional physical medical services foundations like clinics, nursing homes, and long haul care offices will be old. Due to recent advancements in modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the smart healthcare system has become increasingly necessary (ML). This paper will discuss wearable and smartphone technologies, AI for medical diagnostics, and assistive structures, including social robots, that have been created for the surrounding upheld living climate. The review presents programming reconciliation structures that are urgent for consolidating information examination and other man-made consciousness instruments to develop brilliant medical care frameworks (AI).",2023.0,2023-05-17,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00449468f147c5c0ac3345ffad4018bd36ec92c1

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT. Materials and Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I–II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors. Results Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794–0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873–0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789–0.915), respectively.

Although CaOx crystallization inhibitors have been suggested as a therapeutic modality already decades ago, limited progress has been made in the discovery of potent molecules with efficacy in animal disease models. Herein, an image‐based machine learning approach to systematically screen chemically modified myo‐inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) analogues is utilized, which enables the identification of a highly active divalent inositol phosphate molecule. To date, this is the first molecule shown to completely inhibit the crystallization process in the nanomolar range, reduce crystal–cell interactions, thereby preventing CaOx‐induced transcriptomic changes, and decrease renal CaOx deposition and kidney injury in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria.

10.3389/fneur.2023.1189076,Experimental verification and identifying biomarkers related to insomnia,"Introduction Insomnia is the most common form of sleep deprivation (SD) observed in clinics. Although there are differences between insomnia and SD, they have similar symptoms and the same animal model. Currently, there is a lack of microarray data on insomnia. Therefore, for now, we are going to apply the SD data to insomnia. Although many studies have explained the possible mechanisms associated with insomnia, no previous studies have considered the key genes associated with insomnia or the relationship between insomnia and immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between key genes and immune cells by identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of insomnia. Next, we verified the efficacy of these biomarkers experimentally. Methods First, we downloaded four microarrays (GSE11755, GSE12624, GSE28750, and GSE48080) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 239 normal human blood samples and 365 blood specimens from patients with SD. Then, we analyzed two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model to investigate these key genes. Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not. Discussion In summary, we identified a key gene (C2CD2L) that may facilitate the development of biomarkers for insomnia.",2023.0,2023-11-28,2,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00471583b7d751fc7043be63f18eaa4b25985bec

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011010,Combining phylogeny and coevolution improves the inference of interaction partners among paralogous proteins,"Predicting protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important goal of computational biology. Various sources of information can be used to this end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of sequences is modest. Author summary When two protein families interact, their sequences feature statistical dependencies. First, interacting proteins tend to share a common evolutionary history. Second, maintaining structure and interactions through the course of evolution yields coevolution, detectable via correlations in the amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",2022.0,2022-08-24,6,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0047d0cad12b452bb9d27d81105380f589085199
10.1063/5.0126358,Recent trends in marine microplastic modeling and machine learning tools: Potential for long-term microplastic monitoring,"The increase in the global demand for plastics, and more recently during the pandemic, is a major concern for the future of plastic waste pollution and microplastics. Efficient microplastic monitoring is imperative to understanding the long-term effects and progression of microplastic effects in the environment. Numerical models are valuable in studying microplastic transport as they can be used to examine the effects of different parameters systematically to help elucidate the fate and transport processes of microplastics, thus providing a holistic view of microplastics in the ocean environment. By incorporating physical parameters (such as size, shape, density, and identity of microplastics), numerical models have gained better understanding of the physics of microplastic transport, predicted sinking velocities more accurately, and estimated microplastic pathways in marine environments. However, availability of large amounts of information about microplastic physical and chemical parameters is sparse. Machine learning and computer-vision tools can aid in acquiring environmental information and provide input to develop more accurate models and verify their predictions. More accurate models can further the understanding of microplastic transport, facilitate monitoring efforts, and thus optimize where more data collection can take place to ultimately improve machine learning tools. This review offers a perspective on how image-based machine learning can be exploited to help uncover the physics of microplastic transport behaviors. Additionally, the authors hope the review inspires studies that can bridge the gap between numerical modeling and machine learning for microplastic analysis to exploit their joined potential.",2023.0,2023-01-14,23,58,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004803f2035c025936c33a5ef4445eba34a339ba

As with any machine learning implementation, the challenge on the utilization of MLPNN in rainfall forecasting lies in the development and evaluation of MLPNN models which delivers optimal forecasting performance. This research conducted performance analysis of MLPNN models through data preparation, model designing, and model evaluation in order to determine which parameters are the best-fit configurations for MLPNN model implementation in rainfall forecasting. During rainfall data preparation, imputation process and spatial correlation evaluation of weather variables from various weather stations showed that the geographical location of the chosen weather stations did not have a direct correlation between stations with respect to rainfall behavior leading to the decision of utilizing the weather station having the most complete weather data to be fed in the MLPNN. By conducting performance analysis of MLPNN models with different combinations of training algorithms, activation functions, learning rate, and momentum, it was found out that MLPNN model having 100 hidden neurons with Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm and Sigmoid activation function delivered the lowest RMSE of 0.031537 while another MLPNN model having the same number of hidden neurons, the same activation function but Resilient Propagation as training algorithm had the lowest MAE of 0.0209.

The method for developing recommendations based on collaborative filtering such as Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and hybrid methods of Machine Learning (ML) has been improved. The paper describes the design principles and functional requirements to a recommendation system in the form of a Web application for choosing the content required by user using movies as an example. The research has focused on solving issues related to cold start and scalability within the method of collaborative filtering. To effectively address these tasks, we have used hybrid training methods. A hybrid recommendation system (HRS) has been practically implemented for providing relevant content recommendations using movies as an example, taking into consideration the user's personal preferences based on the constructed hybrid method. We have improved an algorithm for developing content recommendations based on the collaborative filtering and Machine Learning for the combined filtration of similarity indicators among users or goods. The hybrid algorithm receives initial information in a different form, normalizes it, and generates relevant recommendations based on a combination of CF and CBF methods. Machine Learning is capable of defining those factors that influence the selection of relevant films, which improves development of recommendations specific to the user. To solve these tasks, a new improved method has been proposed, underlying which, in contrast to existing systems of recommendations, are the hybrid methods and Machine Learning.

Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2 mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. The F1 scores and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.86, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.86, and 0.81, 0.77, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. The explanation of the model output based on SHAP values can provide a reference basis for medical physicists when adjusting the plan, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of treatment plans.Conclusion: It is feasible to use a machine learning method based on radiomics to establish a gamma pass rate classification prediction model for IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvis. The XGBoost model performs better in classification than the other three tree-based ensemble models, and global explanations and single-sample explanations of the model output through SHAP values may offer reference for medical physicists to provide high-quality plans, promoting the clinical application and implementation of GPR prediction models, and providing safe and efficient personalized QA management for patients.",2023.0,2023-08-10,1,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004abb09f8331e8f161049ca7578bbd3011e0f3c

Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. Methods The multi-institutional PHIS+ clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children’s hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Results Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity . Conclusions NLP-based pneumonia information extraction of pediatric diagnostic imaging reports performed better than domain experts in this pilot study.

However, they have strong relations since a longer processing time triggers a change in schedule. Although promising approaches already exist for mapping the influence of manufacturing processes on production scheduling, the variability of the production environment, including changing process conditions, technological parameters and the status of current orders, is usually ignored. For this reason, this paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that adaptively refines the production schedule by applying Machine Learning (ML)-models during the manufacturing process in order to predict the process-dependent parameters that influence the schedule. With the proper prediction of these parameters based on the process conditions, the production schedule is proactively adjusted to changing conditions not only to ensure the sufficient product quality but also to reduce the negative effects and losses that delayed rescheduling would cause. The proposed approach aims on minimizing the overall lateness by utilizing an active data exchange between the scheduling system and the predictive ML-models on the process level. The efficiency of the solution is demonstrated by a realistic case study using discrete event simulation.",2019.0,2019-11-13,6,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004b6d70928e09cd0a0ce84fc49c270a4b754e41
10.7554/eLife.10047,Active machine learning-driven experimentation to determine compound effects on protein patterns,"High throughput screening determines the effects of many conditions on a given biological target. Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance.

We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), and high (0.5 < z < 1.0). By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for ∼60%–70% of the host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of ∼80%–95%, depending on the redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve a disk precision of 96%/82%/79% and bulge precision of 90%/90%/80% (for the three redshift bins) at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of 30%/43%/42%. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging surveys.",2022.0,2022-12-20,3,76,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c9375fc25383cc6c0e47e28b2eba73002696d
10.3390/en15113895,Projecting the Thermal Response in a HTGR-Type System during Conduction Cooldown Using Graph-Laplacian Based Machine Learning,"Accurate prediction of an off-normal event in a nuclear reactor is dependent upon the availability of sensory data, reactor core physical condition, and understanding of the underlying phenomenon. This work presents a method to project the data from some discrete sensory locations to the overall reactor domain during conduction cooldown scenarios similar to High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). The existing models for conductive cooldown in a heterogeneous multi-body system, such as an assembly of prismatic blocks or pebble beds relies on knowledge of the thermal contact conductance, requiring significant knowledge of local thermal contacts and heat transport possibilities across those contacts. With a priori knowledge of bulk geometry features and some discrete sensors, a machine learning approach was devised. The presented work uses an experimental facility to mimic conduction cooldown with an assembly of 68 cylindrical rods initially heated to 1200 K. High-fidelity temperature data were collected using an infrared (IR) camera to provide training data to the model and validate the predicted temperature data. The machine learning approach used here first converts the macroscopic bulk geometry information into Graph-Laplacian, and then uses the eigenvectors of the Graph-Laplacian to develop Kernel functions. Support vector regression (SVR) was implemented on the obtained Kernels and used to predict the thermal response in a packed rod assembly during a conduction cooldown experiment. The usage of SVR modeling differs from most models today because of its representation of thermal coupling between rods in the core. When trained with thermographic data, the average normalized error is less than 2% over 400 s, during which temperatures of the assembly have dropped by more than 500 K. The rod temperature prediction performance was significantly better for rods in the interior of the assembly compared to those near the exterior, likely due to the model simplification of the surroundings.",2022.0,2022-05-25,1,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c9f94e112605e0cae7497d8a31e2d44ee0c10

10.1017/S1751731120000312,Review: Synergy between mechanistic modelling and data-driven models for modern animal production systems in the era of big data.,"Mechanistic models (MMs) have served as causal pathway analysis and 'decision-support' tools within animal production systems for decades. Such models quantitatively define how a biological system works based on causal relationships and use that cumulative biological knowledge to generate predictions and recommendations (in practice) and generate/evaluate hypotheses (in research). Their limitations revolve around obtaining sufficiently accurate inputs, user training and accuracy/precision of predictions on-farm. The new wave in digitalization technologies may negate some of these challenges. New data-driven (DD) modelling methods such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) examine patterns in data to produce accurate predictions (forecasting, classification of animals, etc.). The deluge of sensor data and new self-learning modelling techniques may address some of the limitations of traditional MM approaches - access to input data (e.g. sensors) and on-farm calibration. However, most of these new methods lack transparency in the reasoning behind predictions, in contrast to MM that have historically been used to translate knowledge into wisdom. The objective of this paper is to propose means to hybridize these two seemingly divergent methodologies to advance the models we use in animal production systems and support movement towards truly knowledge-based precision agriculture. In order to identify potential niches for models in animal production of the future, a cross-species (dairy, swine and poultry) examination of the current state of the art in MM and new DD methodologies (ML, DL analytics) is undertaken. We hypothesize that there are several ways via which synergy may be achieved to advance both our predictive capabilities and system understanding, being: (1) building and utilizing data streams (e.g. intake, rumination behaviour, rumen sensors, activity sensors, environmental sensors, cameras and near IR) to apply MM in real-time and/or with new resolution and capabilities; (2) hybridization of MM and DD approaches where, for example, a ML framework is augmented by MM-generated parameters or predicted outcomes and (3) hybridization of the MM and DD approaches, where biological bounds are placed on parameters within a MM framework, and the DD system parameterizes the MM for individual animals, farms or other such clusters of data. As animal systems modellers, we should expand our toolbox to explore new DD approaches and big data to find opportunities to increase understanding of biological systems, find new patterns in data and move the field towards intelligent, knowledge-based precision agriculture systems.",2020.0,2020-03-06,38,58,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004e1e48c8b5bf4d159d683d722604ee0ba37be1

It is no longer a dream to assist the development of pedagogical expert systems to solve the current problems of insufficient teachers and single teaching tools in music pedagogy reform and to realize the sharing of teaching resources. Artificial intelligence system under music education and education not only breaks the traditional music education model but also promotes the development of music education. This paper introduces the principle of artificial intelligence and analyzes the problems faced by university music education, and the implementation method of vocal education system based on artificial intelligence for music majors is also specifically studied in this paper. This mainly involves the design of the system architecture, such as the system architecture, which is designed to meet the requirements of the whole system. A survey of 100 students found that 82% of students preferred computer-based education to traditional music education. An artificial intelligence-based vocal teaching system for music majors is a system with good applications, where teachers keep track of students’ learning through reasoning and analysis, enabling students to learn on their own. Learning music requires constant practice, expanding horizons, and accepting new ways of teaching, and the combination of music and the Internet is the latest option to use resources wisely, optimize them, and provide comprehensive resources. Although a variety of music education aids have emerged, few are actually suitable for music classroom education, so it is important to study and implement AI-based speech education systems for music majors.",2022.0,2022-05-18,27,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00011146c48e52a8447773b714a8432cda04020a
10.1080/0964704X.2018.1561070,Neuroanniversary 2019,"Josef Gerstmann (1887–1969) graduated at the Medical University in Vienna in 1912. He worked there with Julius Wagner von Jauregg (1857–1940), lectured in neurology and psychiatry, and became a professor in 1930. He emigrated to the United States in 1938, working in Ohio, Washington, and New York, where he died in 1969. He published his best-known paper on finger-agnosia in 1924. The Gerstmann syndrome is characterized by finger agnosia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, and left-right syndrome and has been associated with damage to the inferior parietal lobe of the dominant hemisphere. American neurophysiologist Warren Sturgish McCullough (1898–1969) and logician and computer scientist Walter Pitts (1923–1969) both passed away in 1969. McCulloch and Pitts created computational models based on mathematical algorithms called threshold logic, which split the inquiry into two distinct approaches, one focused on biological processes in the brain (single cell recording) and the other on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. Johannes Maagaard Nielsen (1890–1969), born in Aarslev, Denmark, moved to the United States in 1896. He became clinical professor of neurology at the University of California at Los Angeles. He was one of the founders of the Society of Biological Psychiatry and was its president from 1947 to 1948. In 1936, he published Agnosia, Apraxia, Aphasia: Their Value in Cerebral Localization, a textbook for neurologists. The Society for Neuroscience was founded in 1969 by Ralph W. Gerard (1900–1974), an American neurophysiologist and behavioral scientist. The first annual meeting of the society was held in Washington, D.C., in 1971, and it was attended by 1,396 scientists. The Society publishes the Journal of Neuroscience. In 1969, Suzuki Jiro and Takaku Akira published their study on “cerebrovascular moyamoya disease.” The disease produces an abnormal net-like blood vessel picture, characterized with the Japanese word moyamoya—an expression for something hazy like a puff of cigarette smoke drifting in the air.

Technology has evolved and, recently, the Scheimpflug principle was associated with a non-contact air-puff tonometer, allowing a thorough analysis of corneal biomechanics and a biomechanically corrected intraocular pressure assessment, opening up new perspectives both in ophthalmology and in other medical areas. Data from corneal biomechanics assessment are being integrated in artificial intelligence models in order to increase its value in clinical practice. Objective To review the state of the art in the field of corneal biomechanics assessment with special emphasis to the technology based on ultra-high-speed Scheimpflug imaging during non-contact tonometry.

10.2196/25312,Voice-Controlled Intelligent Personal Assistants in Health Care: International Delphi Study,"Background Voice-controlled intelligent personal assistants (VIPAs), such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, involve artificial intelligence–powered algorithms designed to simulate humans. Their hands-free interface and growing capabilities have a wide range of applications in health care, covering off-clinic education, health monitoring, and communication. However, conflicting factors, such as patient safety and privacy concerns, make it difficult to foresee the further development of VIPAs in health care. Objective This study aimed to develop a plausible scenario for the further development of VIPAs in health care to support decision making regarding the procurement of VIPAs in health care organizations. Methods We conducted a two-stage Delphi study with an internationally recruited panel consisting of voice assistant experts, medical professionals, and representatives of academia, governmental health authorities, and nonprofit health associations having expertise with voice technology. Twenty projections were formulated and evaluated by the panelists. Descriptive statistics were used to derive the desired scenario. Results The panelists expect VIPAs to be able to provide solid medical advice based on patients’ personal health information and to have human-like conversations. However, in the short term, voice assistants might neither provide frustration-free user experience nor outperform or replace humans in health care. With a high level of consensus, the experts agreed with the potential of VIPAs to support elderly people and be widely used as anamnesis, informational, self-therapy, and communication tools by patients and health care professionals. Although users’ and governments’ privacy concerns are not expected to decrease in the near future, the panelists believe that strict regulations capable of preventing VIPAs from providing medical help services will not be imposed. Conclusions According to the surveyed experts, VIPAs will show notable technological development and gain more user trust in the near future, resulting in widespread application in health care. However, voice assistants are expected to solely support health care professionals in their daily operations and will not be able to outperform or replace medical staff.",2020.0,2020-10-27,48,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0006350033ebe684682a0d301d4561cd401e9eae

It generates text based on the information provided by users. It is currently being evaluated in medical research, publishing, and healthcare. However, there has been no prior study on the evaluation of its ability to help in kidney transplant research. This feasibility study aimed to evaluate the application and accuracy of ChatGPT in the field of kidney transplantation. Methods: On two separate dates, February 21 and March 2, 2023, ChatGPT 3.5 was questioned regarding the medical treatment of kidney transplants and related scientific facts. The responses provided by the chatbot were compiled, and a panel of two specialists reviewed the correctness of each answer. Results: We demonstrated that ChatGPT possessed substantial general knowledge of kidney transplantation; however, they lacked sufficient information and had inaccurate information that necessitates a deeper understanding of the topic. Moreover, ChatGPT failed to provide references for any of the scientific data it provided regarding kidney transplants, and when requested for references, it provided inaccurate ones. Conclusion: The results of this short feasibility study indicate that ChatGPT may have the ability to assist in data collecting when a particular query is posed. However, caution should be exercised and it should not be used in isolation as a supplement to research or decisions regarding healthcare because there are still challenges with data accuracy and missing information.",2023.0,2023-07-01,14,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0007296308bf0ea5f03ba0771607a12b21e78ff0

10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3346187,An Autonomous Deployment Mechanism for AI Security Services,"Future network architectures are expected to be autonomous, intelligent, and service-based, posing new security challenges. To address these challenges, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) security service emerges as a promising solution. However, the complex service configurations and performance guarantees hinder the autonomous deployment of the AI security service. This paper proposes an autonomous deployment mechanism in Software-Defined Networking/Network Function Virtualization (SDN/NFV) enabled networks. First, our mechanism introduces user and decision planes on top of the control plane, enabling hierarchical intent expression and translation from user security intent to security policies. Then, we analyze the embedding problem of the AI-based Security Function Chain (AISFC) during security policy generation. We formulate the AISFC embedding problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task to minimize the total response delay. By decomposing it into AISF placement and routing, we design a heuristic algorithm with polynomial time complexity. Finally, we validate the proposed mechanism through a prototype system and numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to autonomously translate, implement, and guarantee the user security intent. Comparative analysis shows that our approach considering the relationship between available computing resources and delay achieves smaller response delays than the baseline. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves a gap from optimality approximately 28.57% smaller than the greedy algorithm and supports networks that are 4.34 times larger in scale than the exact solution within a 2-second execution time.",2024.0,,0,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000ac518ae147334a91f4b7859641d9254099bf3

10.3390/biomedicines10020285,Pseudoprogression in Glioblastoma: Role of Metabolic and Functional MRI-Systematic Review,"Background: Glioblastoma is the most frequent malignant primitive brain tumor in adults. The treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. During follow-up, combined chemoradiotherapy can induce treatment-related changes mimicking tumor progression on medical imaging, such as pseudoprogression (PsP). Differentiating PsP from true progression (TP) remains a challenge for radiologists and oncologists, who need to promptly start a second-line treatment in the case of TP. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion MRI, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging are more efficient than conventional MRI in differentiating PsP from TP. None of these techniques are fully effective, but current advances in computer science and the advent of artificial intelligence are opening up new possibilities in the imaging field with radiomics (i.e., extraction of a large number of quantitative MRI features describing tumor density, texture, and geometry). These features are used to build predictive models for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response. Method: Out of 7350 records for MR spectroscopy, GBM, glioma, recurrence, diffusion, perfusion, pseudoprogression, radiomics, and advanced imaging, we screened 574 papers. A total of 228 were eligible, and we analyzed 72 of them, in order to establish the role of each imaging modality and the usefulness and limitations of radiomics analysis.",2022.0,2022-01-26,24,87,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d8a391629e924c2d28b787eae0454ce38abc4

10.3390/su15043057,A Composite Resilience Index (CRI) for Developing Resilience and Sustainability in University Towns,"Globally, most higher educational institutions can no longer house their students within their campuses due to the increased number of enrolments and the unavailability of land for spatial expansion, especially in urban areas. This leads to studentification which negatively impacts university towns. Developing resilience against the negative impacts of studentification will make university towns more sustainable. However, there is no existing community resilience index designed for that purpose. Thus, this study develops a composite resilience index for university towns, using Akoka, a university town in Lagos, Nigeria, as a case study. The composites of the index were determined by prioritizing online user-generated content mined from Twitter between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2021 using artificial intelligence, while the elements of resilience and risk reduction were developed through the Delphi and analytic hierarchy process. The research outcomes showed that the physical, economic, social, and cultural criteria subjected to comparisons represented ≥70% of the total weights. These criteria made up the outcome indicators, while the integrated community-based risk reduction program model was adopted for the process indicators. Both outcome and process indicators formed the localized composite resilience index for Akoka, Lagos, Nigeria. This proposed composite resilience index would help the town to assess and build resilience against the negative impacts of studentification and provide a methodology for other university towns to create theirs using similar methods.",2023.0,2023-02-08,1,77,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0016fbbc401b76f230c7c2d3f1857c1db2d3a6a4

10.1093/europace/euad122.531,Comparison of amplified P-wave analysis to artificial intelligence-derived analysis for diagnosis of atrial cardiomyopathy and outcome prediction following pvi for persistent atrial fibrillation,"Abstract Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: None. Introduction Left atrial cardiomyopathy (ACM) is invasively diagnosed by presence of low voltage substrate (LVS) in electro-anatomical mapping. ACM is associated with high (50%) AF recurrence rates after PVI, but also with increased risk for de-novo AF and ischemic stroke. Aims We establish and compare ACM-diagnosis based on 12-lead-ECG analysis, using (A) digital amplified p-wave analysis during SR versus (B) a neural network trained to diagnose ACM using automatically determined sinus-p-wave features (duration, morphology) in 12-lead-ECG as inputs. Methods Left atrial (LA) voltage mapping was acquired during SR in 270 AF (50% paroxysmal; 43% female; age: 64+/-11years) prior to PVI. ACM was defined as presence of left atrial LVS<0.5mV at >2cm2 during SR, and was detected in 95/270 (35.2%) of patients. P-wave-analysis was assessed for outcome prediction in a prospective cohort of persistent AF patients undergoing rhythm monitoring using 7-day Holter at 6 and 12 months post PVI-only approach. Results The duration of amplified sinus-p-wave (APWD) >151ms (left top panel) enabled to diagnose ACM with an AUC 0.87 (sensitivity: 78% and specificity: 76%, left bottom panel). The accuracy of the AI-neural-network-derived ECG-analysis (using automatically determined APWD and p-morphology criteria) for ACM diagnosis was: AUC 0.85, sensitivity 74%, specificity 78%, accuracy: 77% (see right panel top and bottom). Application of AI-derived ACM-diagnosis on a prospective cohort of persistent AF patients undergoing PVI-only approach (n=58) enabled arrhythmia outcome prediction: Patients with vs. without ACM (based on AI-derived p-wave-analysis) had significantly higher arrhythmia recurrences at 12 months following PVI (46% vs. 23%, p=0.017). Conclusion Both the measurement of the APWD and the automatic neural network-based p-wave-analysis enable diagnosis of individuals with left atrial cardiomyopathy with high accuracy in a large cohort of patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF. Diagnosis of ACM based on automatic neural-network-based P-wave analysis enables identification of patients at high risk for arrhythmia recurrence post PVI-only ablation approach.",2023.0,2023-05-24,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001956ba9e06394ca0d500ae50f21d0f10d7a88a

10.24818/ea/2024/65/241,Artificial Intelligence in Business Education: Benefits and Tools,"Understanding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on education is vital for guiding teachers in developing educational tools. AI in education (AIEd) comes not only with opportunities but mostly with challenges for both educators and learners. Finding the proper tools to integrate AI into the learning framework represents a test for current and future generations. Even if most students acknowledged AI as a valuable tool, their interaction with AI in education seems more limited than expected. They mainly concentrated on few tools with higher awareness. This paper examines AI’s support for educational activities, key drivers, and tools for business education. Survey data collected from 254 learners were analysed using multivariate binary logistic regression. Two research questions were formulated to verify if AI supports educational activities and what AI tools support business educational activities. Results show learners appreciate AI for aiding teachers in administrative tasks, personalising learning plans, and saving time. However, learners are unfamiliar with most benefits of AI tools, except computer vision, edge computing, and AI chatbots.

10.1109/TGRS.2023.3293270,Spotting Virus From Satellites: Modeling the Circulation of West Nile Virus Through Graph Neural Networks,"The occurrence of West Nile virus (WNV) represents one of the most common mosquito-borne zoonosis viral infections. Its circulation is usually associated with climatic and environmental conditions suitable for vector proliferation and virus replication. On top of that, several statistical models have been developed to shape and forecast WNV circulation: in particular, the recent massive availability of Earth observation (EO) data coupled with the continuous advances in the field of artificial intelligence offer valuable opportunities. In this article, we seek to predict WNV circulation by feeding deep neural networks (DNNs) with satellite images, which have been extensively shown to hold environmental and climatic features. Notably, while previous approaches analyze each geographical site independently, we propose a spatial-aware approach that considers also the characteristics of close sites. Specifically, we build upon graph neural networks (GNNs) to aggregate features from neighboring places and further extend these modules to consider multiple relations, such as the difference in temperature and soil moisture between two sites, as well as the geographical distance. Moreover, we inject time-related information directly into the model to take into account the seasonality of virus spread. We design an experimental setting that combines satellite images—from Landsat and Sentinel missions—with ground-truth observations of WNV circulation in Italy. We show that our proposed multiadjacency graph attention network (MAGAT) consistently leads to higher performance when paired with an appropriate pretraining stage. Finally, we assess the importance of each component of MAGAT in our ablation studies.",2022.0,2022-09-07,3,76,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d3a973be3e277960937febacc47bb38825fe6
10.1145/3625287,Explainable Deep Learning Methods in Medical Image Classification: A Survey,"The remarkable success of deep learning has prompted interest in its application to medical imaging diagnosis. Even though state-of-the-art deep learning models have achieved human-level accuracy on the classification of different types of medical data, these models are hardly adopted in clinical workflows, mainly due to their lack of interpretability. The black-box nature of deep learning models has raised the need for devising strategies to explain the decision process of these models, leading to the creation of the topic of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this context, we provide a thorough survey of XAI applied to medical imaging diagnosis, including visual, textual, example-based and concept-based explanation methods. Moreover, this work reviews the existing medical imaging datasets and the existing metrics for evaluating the quality of the explanations. In addition, we include a performance comparison among a set of report generation–based methods.

10.3121/cmr.2024.1934,Diagnostic Accuracy of AI Algorithms in Aortic Stenosis Screening: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Aortic stenosis (AS) is frequently identified at an advanced stage after clinical symptoms appear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for AS screening.Methods: We conducted a thorough search of six databases. Several evaluation parameters, such as sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and area under the curve (AUC) value were employed in the diagnostic meta-analysis of AI-based algorithms for AS screening. The AI algorithms utilized diverse data sources including electrocardiograms (ECG), chest radiographs, auscultation audio files, electronic stethoscope recordings, and cardio-mechanical signals from non-invasive wearable inertial sensors.Results: Of the 295 articles identified, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates for AI-based algorithms in diagnosing AS were as follows: sensitivity 0.83 (95% CI: 0.81-0.85), specificity 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79-0.84), PLR 4.78 (95% CI: 3.12-7.32), NLR 0.20 (95% CI: 0.13-0.28), and DOR 27.11 (95% CI: 14.40-51.05). The AUC value was 0.909 (95% CI: 0.889-0.929), indicating outstanding diagnostic accuracy. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses showed that continent, type of AS, data source, and type of AI-based method constituted sources of heterogeneity. Furthermore, we demonstrated proof of publication bias for DOR values analyzed using Egger's regression test (P = 0.002) and a funnel plot.Conclusion: Deep learning approaches represent highly sensitive, feasible, and scalable strategies to identify patients with moderate or severe AS.",2024.0,2024-09-01,2,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0025816e118e438fe57202c44ffc14999564d059

10.31026/j.eng.2020.07.04,Using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System to Predict Rate of Penetration from Dynamic Elastic Properties,"Rate of penetration plays a vital role in field development process because the drilling operation is expensive and include the cost of equipment and materials used during the penetration of rock and efforts of the crew in order to complete the well without major problems. It’s important to finish the well as soon as possible to reduce the expenditures. So, knowing the rate of penetration in the area that is going to be drilled will help in speculation of the cost and that will lead to optimize drilling outgoings. In this research, an intelligent model was built using artificial intelligence to achieve this goal.  The model was built using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system to predict the rate of penetration in Mishrif formation in Nasiriya oil field for the selected wells. The mean square error for the results obtained from the ANFIS model was 0.015. The model was trained and simulated using MATLAB and Simulink platform. Laboratory measurements were conducted on core samples selected from two wells. Ultrasonic device was used to measure the transit time of compressional and shear waves and to compare these results with log records. Ten wells in Nasiriya oil field had been selected based on the availability of the data. Dynamic elastic properties of Mishrif formation in the selected wells were determined by using Interactive Petrophysics (IP V3.5) software and based on the las files and log records provided. The average rate of penetration of the studied wells was determined and listed against depth with the average dynamic elastic properties and fed into the fuzzy system. The average values of bulk modulus for the ten wells ranged between (20.57) and (27.57) . For shear modulus, the range was from (8.63) to (12.95) GPa. Also, the Poisson’s ratio values varied from (0.297) to (0.307). For the first group of wells (NS-1, NS-3, NS-4, NS-5, and NS-18), the ROP values were taken from the drilling reports and the lowest ROP was at the bottom of the formation with a value of (3.965) m/hrs while the highest ROP at the top of the formation with a value (4.073) m/hrs. The ROP values predicted by the ANFIS for this group were (3.181) m/hrs and (4.865) m/hrs for the lowest and highest values respectively. For the second group of wells (NS-9, NS-15, NS-16, NS-19, and NS-21), the highest ROP obtained from drilling reports was (4.032) m/hrs while the lowest value was (3.96) m/hrs. For the predicted values by ANFIS model were (2.35) m/hrs and (4.3) m/hrs for the lowest and highest ROP values respectively.",2020.0,2020-07-01,1,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002672661e7976ee10ff6e81ebfa55606d4f7e09

There is a linear trend of advancement and automation in the medical field for the early diagnosis of several diseases. One of the critical and challenging diseases in the medical field is coma. In the medical research field, currently, the prediction of these diseases is performed only using the data gathered from the devices only; however, the human's input is much essential to accurately understand their health condition to take appropriate decision on time. Therefore, we have proposed a healthcare framework involving the concept of artificial intelligence in the human-in- the-loop cyber-physical system. This model works via a response loop in which the human's intention is concluded by gathering biological signals and context data, and then, the decision is interpreted to a system action that is recognizable to the human in the physical environment, thereby completing the loop. In this paper, we have designed a model for early prognosis of coma using the electroencephalogram dataset. In the proposed approach, we have achieved the best results using a statistical learning algorithm called autoregressive integrated moving average in comparison to artificial neural networks and long short-term memory models. In order to measure the efficiency of our model, we have used the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) value to evaluate the linear models as it gives the difference between the measured value and true or correct value.

10.3390/cancers14153686,The Significance of External Quality Assessment Schemes for Molecular Testing in Clinical Laboratories,"Simple Summary Patients and clinicians often rely on the outcome of laboratory tests, but can we really trust these test results? Good quality management is key for laboratories to guarantee reliable test results. This review focusses on external quality assessment (EQA) schemes which are a tool for laboratories to examine and improve the quality of their testing routines. In this review, an overview of the role and importance of EQA schemes for clinical laboratories is given, and different types of EQA schemes and EQA providers available on the market are discussed, as well as recent developments in the EQA landscape. Abstract External quality assessment (EQA) schemes are a tool for clinical laboratories to evaluate and manage the quality of laboratory practice with the support of an independent party (i.e., an EQA provider). Depending on the context, there are different types of EQA schemes available, as well as various EQA providers, each with its own field of expertise. In this review, an overview of the general requirements for EQA schemes and EQA providers based on international guidelines is provided. The clinical and scientific value of these kinds of schemes for clinical laboratories, clinicians and patients are highlighted, in addition to the support EQA can provide to other types of laboratories, e.g., laboratories affiliated to biotech companies. Finally, recent developments and challenges in laboratory medicine and quality management, for example, the introduction of artificial intelligence in the laboratory and the shift to a more individual-approach instead of a laboratory-focused approach, are discussed. EQA schemes should represent current laboratory practice as much as possible, which poses the need for EQA providers to introduce latest laboratory innovations in their schemes and to apply up-to-date guidelines. By incorporating these state-of-the-art techniques, EQA aims to contribute to continuous learning.",2022.0,2022-07-28,13,74,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002cbe30e89dc716070fe624625d573541eae428

The consequences of 3 major approaches of the architectural dimension for the development of Knowledge Engineering (KE) tools are discussed in this study. The methodology is shown by a hierarchy of KE tools to enable systems management and knowledge development at the architectural design dimension, as well as architecture for controlling uncertainty through reasoning about actions. This article discusses architecture-dimension tools for KE. Knowledge architecture is a way of tailoring conventional AI problem-solving strategies to a specific set of activities. Architecture describes a certain kind of issue solution (e.g., diagnostic or reconfiguration) at a theoretical dimension above the application, indicating which parts of a problem class are fundamental to the issue and which are integration artifacts. An information system's design is a partial model in which certain choices are taken ahead of time to accommodate specific job characteristics. Many medical diagnostic systems, for example, evaluate data from the bottom up to identify ""triggered"" illness hypotheses, and then create top-down tasks to gather evidence for and against the hypotheses.

10.3390/rs14143450,Multi-Task Learning of Relative Height Estimation and Semantic Segmentation from Single Airborne RGB Images,"The generation of topographic classification maps or relative heights from aerial or remote sensing images represents a crucial research tool in remote sensing. On the one hand, from auto-driving, three-dimensional city modeling, road design, and resource statistics to smart cities, each task requires relative height data and classification data of objects. On the other hand, most relative height data acquisition methods currently use multiple images. We find that relative height and geographic classification data can be mutually assisted through data distribution. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it has become possible to estimate the relative height from a single image. It learns implicit mapping relationships in a data-driven manner that may not be explicitly available through mathematical modeling. On this basis, we propose a unified, in-depth learning structure that can generate both estimated relative height maps and semantically segmented maps and perform end-to-end training. Compared with the existing methods, our task is to perform both relative height estimation and semantic segmentation tasks simultaneously. We only need one picture to obtain the corresponding semantically segmented images and relative heights simultaneously. The model’s performance is much better than that of equivalent computational models. We also designed dynamic weights to enable the model to learn relative height estimation and semantic segmentation simultaneously. At the same time, we have conducted good experiments on existing datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed Transformer-based network architecture is suitable for relative height estimation tasks and vastly outperforms other state-of-the-art DL (Deep Learning) methods.",2022.0,2022-07-18,9,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00378414366fad5acae9ad8e05f2fb2bb8981951

10.22114/AJEM.v1i1.11,Artificial Intelligence-Based Triage for Patients with Acute Abdominal Pain in Emergency Department; a Diagnostic Accuracy Study,"Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems which are capable of doing human intelligence tasks such as decision making and problem solving. AI-based tools have been used for predicting various factors in medicine including risk stratification, diagnosis and choice of treatment. AI can also be of considerable help in emergency departments, especially patients’ triage. Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the application of AI in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain to estimate emergency severity index version 4 (ESI-4) score without the estimate of the required resources. Methods: A mixed-model approach was used for predicting the ESI-4 score. Seventy percent of the patient cases were used for training the models and the remaining 30% for testing the accuracy of the models. During the training phase, patients were randomly selected and were given to systems for analysis. The output, which was the level of triage, was compared with the gold standard (emergency medicine physician). During the test phase of the study, another group of randomly selected patients were evaluated by the systems and the results were then compared with the gold standard. Results: Totally, 215 patients who were triaged by the emergency medicine specialist were enrolled in the study. Triage Levels 1 and 5 were omitted due to low number of cases. In triage Level 2, all systems showed fair level of prediction with Neural Network being the highest. In Level 3, all systems again showed fair level of prediction. However, in triage Level 4, decision tree was the only system with fair prediction. Conclusion: The application of AI in triage of patients with acute abdominal pain resulted in a model with acceptable level of accuracy.

10.3389/fphar.2024.1472396,The future of pharmacology and therapeutics of the arachidonic acid cascade in the next decade: Innovative advancements in drug repurposing,"Many drugs can act on multiple targets or disease pathways, regardless of their original purpose. Drug repurposing involves reevaluating existing compounds for new medical uses. This can include repositioning approved drugs, redeveloping unapproved drugs, or repurposing any chemical, nutraceutical, or biotherapeutic product for new applications. Traditional drug development is slow, expensive, and has high failure rates. Drug repurposing can speed up the process, costing less and saving time. This approach can save 6–7 years of early-stage research time. Drug repurposing benefits from existing compounds with optimized structures and approved for clinical use with associated structure-activity relationship publications, supporting the development of new effective compounds. Drug repurposes can now utilize advanced in silico screening enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) and sophisticated tissue and organ-level in vitro models. These models more accurately replicate human physiology and improve the selection of existing drugs for further pre-clinical testing and, eventually, clinical trials for new indications. This mini-review discusses some examples of drug repurposing and novel strategies for further development of compounds for targets of the arachidonic acid cascade. In particular, we will delve into the prospect of repurposing antiplatelet agents for cancer prevention and addressing the emerging noncanonical functionalities of 5-lipoxygenase, potentially for leukemia therapy.",2024.0,2024-08-29,1,41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003c2ab371a7ef328b190538b56d4d6b1dc10470

10.57187/s.3954,Chatbots in medicine: certification process and applied use case.,"Chatbots are computer programs designed to engage in natural language conversations in an easy and understandable way. Their use has been accelerated recently with the advent of large language models. However, their application in medicine and healthcare has been limited due to concerns over data privacy, the risk of providing medical diagnoses, and ensuring regulatory and legal compliance. Medicine and healthcare could benefit from chatbots if their scope is carefully defined and if they are used appropriately and monitored long-term. The confIAnce chatbot, developed at the Geneva University Hospitals and the University of Geneva, is an informational tool aimed at providing simplified information to the general public about primary care and chronic diseases. In this paper, we describe the certification and regulatory aspects applicable to chatbots in healthcare, particularly in primary care medicine. We use the confIAnce chatbot as a case study to explore the definition and classification of a medical device and its application to chatbots, considering the applicable Swiss regulations and the European Union AI Act. Chatbots can be classified anywhere from non-medical devices (informational tools that do not handle patient data or provide recommendations for treatment or diagnosis) to Class III medical devices (high-risk tools capable of predicting potentially fatal events and enabling a pre-emptive medical intervention). Key considerations in the definition and certification process include defining the chatbot's scope, ensuring compliance with regulations, maintaining security and safety, and continuously evaluating performance, risks, and utility. A lexicon of relevant terms related to artificial intelligence in healthcare, medical devices, and regulatory frameworks is also presented in this paper. Chatbots hold potential for both patients and healthcare professionals, provided that their scope of practice is clearly defined, and that they comply with regulatory requirements.

10.1002/advs.202407222,Ginkgetin Alleviates Inflammation and Senescence by Targeting STING,"Abstract Ginkgo biloba extract is reported to have therapeutic effects on aging‐related disorders. However, the specific component responsible for this biological function and its mechanism of action remain largely unknown. This study finds that Ginkgetin, an active ingredient of Ginkgo biloba extract, can alleviate cellular senescence and improve pathologies in multiple tissues of aging mice. To reveal the molecular mechanism of Ginkgetin's anti‐aging effect, a graph convolutional network‐based drug “on‐target” pathway prediction algorithm for prediction is employed. The results indicate that the cGAS‐STING pathway may be a potential target for Ginkgetin. Subsequent cell biological and biophysical data confirmed that Ginkgetin directly binds to the carboxy‐terminal domain of STING protein, thereby inhibiting STING activation and signal transduction. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacodynamic data showed that Ginkgetin effectively alleviates systemic inflammation in Trex1 −/− mice and inhibits the abnormally activated STING signaling in aging mouse model. In summary, this study, utilizing an artificial intelligence algorithm combined with pharmacological methods, confirms STING serves as a critical target for Ginkgetin in alleviating inflammation and senescence. Importantly, this study elucidates the specific component and molecular mechanism underlying the anti‐aging effect of Ginkgo biloba extract, providing a robust theoretical basis for its therapeutic use.",2024.0,2024-11-19,4,53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00425a95851a6fbc8fbccaa027b3cf938540d006

Patients and methods Between January 2020 and July 2022, a total of 61 patients with DDH (31 males, 30 females, mean age: 59.2±10.4 years; range, 35 to 78 years) were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups as those in the observation group of AI-assisted 3D preoperative planning technology (n=34) and the control group of traditional two-dimensional X-ray template planning technology (n=27). Perioperative data of the patients were recorded and analyzed. Results All patients were followed for more than one year, and no hip dislocation, aseptic loosening, periprosthetic fracture, periprosthetic infection or revision occurred. The accuracy of the planning was based on the agreement between the preoperative planning model and the intraoperative model. The accuracy of preoperative planning for the acetabular prosthesis and femoral prosthesis in the observation group was significantly higher than in the control group. No statistically significant difference was found in the postoperative abduction (p=0.416) and anteversion (p=0.225) between the groups. In the observation group, 91.2% of the acetabular cups were implanted within the Lewinnek safe zone (66.7% in the control group) and 88.2% were within the Callanan safe zone (63% in the control group). There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the postoperative lower-limb length discrepancy (p=0.004), which was significantly improved in both groups compared to preoperative values (p<0.01 for all). The postoperative Harris hip score in both groups was significantly improved compared to preoperative scores (p<0.01); however, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.098). Conclusion Our study results suggest that AI-assisted 3D preoperative planning is evidently more successful than traditional 2D X-ray template planning for predicting prosthesis size.

We argue that the increasing adoption of AI to augment human decision-making would benefit from a framework that can characterize such interactions. Thus, the current research invokes judgment and decision-making research on advice from human advisors and uses a conceptual “fit”-based model to: (1) summarize how the characteristics of the AI advisor, human decision-maker, and advice environment influence advice exchanges and outcomes (including informed speculation about the durability of such findings in light of rapid advances in AI technology), (2) delineate future research directions (along with specific predictions), and (3) provide practical implications involving the use of AI advice by human decision-makers in applied settings.",2024.0,2024-10-08,0,147,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0044799d68e9b514c9191c622580840b79b1ee8b

One area where social media advertising is just gaining a foothold is in the recruitment of clinical study participants. Here, as everywhere, social media advertising promises more yield per money spent because the technology can better reach highly specialised groups. In this article, we point out severe societal risks posed by advertising for clinical studies on social media. We show that social media advertising for clinical studies in many cases violates the privacy of individual users (R1), creates collective privacy risks by helping platform companies train predictive models of medical information that can be applied to all their users (R2), exploits the weaknesses of existing guidelines in (biomedical) research ethics (R3) and is detrimental to the quality of (biomedical) research (R4). We argue that the well-intentioned promises, which are often associated with the use of social media advertising for clinical studies, are untenable from a balanced point of view. Consequently, we call for updates of research ethics guidelines and better regulation of Big Data and inferential analytics. We conclude that social media advertising – especially with vulnerable patient populations – is not suitable as a recruitment tool for clinical studies as long as the processing of (even anonymised) social media usage data and the training of predictive models by data analytics and artificial intelligence companies is not sufficiently regulated.",2023.0,2023-01-01,18,96,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0044c601098d7cda2c551d3c8111f4ad5440d6b1

10.3390/a16120541,A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Algorithm to Apply Artificial Intelligence-Based Maintenance in Electrolysers,"Hydrogen provides a clean source of energy that can be produced with the aid of electrolysers. For electrolysers to operate cost-effectively and safely, it is necessary to define an appropriate maintenance strategy. Predictive maintenance is one of such strategies but often relies on data from sensors which can also become faulty, resulting in false information. Consequently, maintenance will not be performed at the right time and failure will occur. To address this problem, the artificial intelligence concept is applied to make predictions on sensor readings based on data obtained from another instrument within the process. In this study, a novel algorithm is developed using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to select the best feature(s) among measured data of the electrolyser, which can best predict the target sensor data for predictive maintenance. The features are used as input into a type of deep neural network called long short-term memory (LSTM) to make predictions. The DLR developed has been compared with those found in literatures within the scope of this study. The results have been excellent and, in fact, have produced the best scores. Specifically, its correlation coefficient with the target variable was practically total (0.99).

However, all applications use individual solutions highly specialized for a particular task. Here, we present an easy-to-use, adaptable, open source software, called AIDeveloper (AID) to train neural nets (NN) for image classification without the need for programming. The software provides a variety of NN-architectures that can be simply selected for training. AID allows the user to apply trained models on new data, obtain metrics for classification performance, and export final models to different formats. The working principles of AID are first illustrated by training a convolutional neural net (CNN) on a large dataset consisting of images of different objects (CIFAR-10). We further explore the potential of AID by training a model to distinguish areas of differentiated and non-differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in culture. Additionally, we compare a conventional clinical whole blood cell count with a whole blood cell count performed by an NN-trained, using a dataset of more than 1.2 million images obtained by real-time deformability cytometry, delivering comparable results. Finally, we demonstrate how AID can be used for label-free classification of B- and T-cells derived from human blood, which currently requires costly and time-consuming sample preparation. Thus, AID can empower anyone to develop, train, and apply NNs for image classification. Moreover, models can be generated by non-programmers, exported, and used on different devices, which allows for an interdisciplinary use.",2020.0,2020-03-05,39,60,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004adca8c810327b796856790f089fc6c7a29dde

10.17083/ijsg.v8i4.456,Design methodology of analytical games for knowledge acquisition,"Analytical games explore a problem or a domain with a research purpose. Considerable research is ongoing to investigate improvements to analytical game design, execution and exploitation. Moreover, the fast-paced technological developments in many fields, such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality, make it even more compellingto account for the advantages and limitations of these new capabilities. In game design, the use of digital means is often regarded as a mere technical factor that relates to the platform selection, facilitator support and data recording processes. In this work a shift in perspective is proposed, to move from technology-oriented design selection criteria towards a broader assessment of the design choices. In fact, the introductionof technology (i.e., automation and autonomy) will not lead to a substitution of tasks, but will intrinsically change the game environment. This work introduces a framework to provide a structured guidance on the aspects to be factored in the different design phases of an analytical game, including the potential impact of the adoption of automation and autonomy. The proposed approach is based on previous research in the fieldof simulation-based serious gaming, model-driven engineering and human factors engineering.

However, these applications require circuits for complex arithmetic computation. The logarithmic number system is a method to reduce the implementation area and transmission delay for arithmetic computation in DSP. In this study, we propose antilogarithmic converters with efficient error–area–delay products (eADPs) based on the fractional-bit compensation scheme. We propose three mathematical approximations—case 1, case 2, and case 3—to approximate the accurate antilogarithmic curve with different DSP requirements. The maximum percentage errors of conversion for case 1, case 2, and case 3 are 1.9089%, 1.7330%, and 1.2063%, respectively. Case 1, case 2, and case 3 can achieve eADP savings of 15.66%, 80.80%, and 84.61% compared with other methods reported in the literature. The proposed eADP-efficient antilogarithmic converters can achieve lower eADP and digitalized circuit implementation. The hardware implementation utilizes Verilog Hardware Description Language and the digital circuits are created via very-large-scale integration by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company with 0.18 µm CMOS technology.

10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3452272,An Improved Bayesian Knowledge Tracking Model for Intelligent Teaching Quality Evaluation in Digital Media,"With the deepening application of artificial intelligence in the field of education, teaching quality evaluation has become the key to improving educational effectiveness. In order to quantify the effectiveness of knowledge transmission and mastery in digital media teaching, this paper proposes an improved Bayesian knowledge tracking model (BF-BKT), which has been specifically optimized for teaching quality evaluation. The motivation stems from the shortcomings of existing technology in evaluating teaching quality, especially the lack of effective integration of student learning behavior and forgetting patterns. This article describes the development process of the BF-BKT model, which innovatively combines learning behavior data and forgetting patterns by introducing behavioral forgetting features to more accurately predict students’ learning status and teaching effectiveness. The BF-BKT model not only considers whether students have mastered a certain knowledge point, but also further analyzes their forgetting situation at different time points, providing a more comprehensive perspective for evaluating teaching quality. To validate the performance of the BF-BKT model, we compared it with the traditional BKT model and two diverse BKT variants. We conducted systematic experiments and analysis by selecting public datasets as simulation scenarios. The experimental results show that the BF-BKT model performs well in predicting students’ knowledge mastery and evaluating teaching quality, and its performance is superior to other comparative methods, proving the effectiveness and superiority of the model.",2024.0,,0,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005c5de9db147eefeaa8055283c283c36bd34b72

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), is a key factor of smart home user experience, the optimization of its mode and attributes is crucial to improve user satisfaction. Smart home system provides a convenient life experience, but the complex interaction mode and unclear interaction attributes may lead to user operation difficulties and affect user acceptance. Therefore, a further study of the mode and attributes of HCI is of great significance for the design of a more humanized intelligent home system. The purpose of this study is to explore the variables related to the characteristics and attributes of HCI in the existing smart homes. The key variables are extracted through an extensive literature review, collecting and organizing existing relevant studies of smart home HCI characteristics and attributes. A comprehensive framework of HCI characteristics is constructed based on the literature findings while the interactions are revealed through the constructed model towards theoretical support and practical guidance for future smart home design. The findings will help smart home developers and designers gain a deeper understanding of user needs in designing a more efficient, intuitive, and satisfactory smart home interaction system.",2024.0,2024-12-31,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005f2df2b3cb350f81f26534962b978bf6dbb453

However, the climate impacts of such intervention are unclear. Here, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework is introduced to quantify how distinguishable an SAI climate might be from a pre‐deployment climate. A suite of neural networks is trained on Earth system model data to learn to distinguish between pre‐ and post‐deployment periods across a variety of climate variables. The network accuracy is analogous to the “climate distinguishability” between the periods, and the corresponding distinctive patterns are identified using XAI methods. For many variables, the two periods are less distinguishable under SAI than under a no‐SAI scenario, suggesting that the specific intervention modeled decelerates future climatic changes and leads to a less novel climate than the no‐SAI scenario. Other climate variables for which the intervention has negligible effect are also highlighted.",2023.0,2023-10-12,3,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006040efea30c6fb8797e3a0463d45ea32fb836f

Location-based advertising (LBA) are utilized for abandoning the user location and to offer assistance by using the obtained information. Therefore, an efficient machine learning and metaheuristic-based model referred as GANM is designed for LBS. Initially, the potential location information is evaluated utilizing the geographic information system (GIS). Thereafter, significant features are computed using the location data. Obtained features are then segmented to improve the process of LBS. Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is then utilized to efficiently classify the user data. Finally, the optimization of classified documents is achieved using the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III). Extensive experiments are performed to validate GANM for LBS. Comparative analyses reveal that GANM outperforms the competitive LBS models in terms of F-score, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve by 2.2734%, 2.3981%, 2.3947%, 2.4271%, and 2.1638%, respectively.",2022.0,2022-03-31,12,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0066112dd5342c7bb5bfc495a4a42ed9e93b1fcf
10.3390/su14127267,Management of Smart and Sustainable Cities in the Post-COVID-19 Era: Lessons and Implications,"Nowadays, the concept of smart sustainable governance is wrapped around basic principles such as: (i) transparency, (ii) accountability, (iii) stakeholders’ involvement, and iv) citizens’ participation. It is through these principles that are influenced by information and communication technologies (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, that the practices employed by citizens and their interaction with electronic government (e-government) are diversified. Previously, the misleading concepts of the smart city implied only the objective of the local level or public officials to utilize technology. However, the recent European experience and research studies have led to a more comprehensive notion that refers to the search for intelligent solutions which allow modern sustainable cities to enhance the quality of services provided to citizens and to improve the management of urban mobility. The smart city is based on the usage of connected sensors, data management, and analytics platforms to improve the quality and functioning of built-environment systems. The aim of this paper is to understand the effects of the pandemic on smart cities and to accentuate major exercises that can be learned for post-COVID sustainable urban management and patterns. The lessons and implications outlined in this paper can be used to enforce social distancing community measures in an effective and timely way, and to optimize the use of resources in smart and sustainable cities in critical situations. The paper offers a conceptual overview and serves as a stepping-stone to extensive research and the deployment of sustainable smart city platforms and intelligent transportation systems (a sub-area of smart city applications) after the COVID-19 pandemic using a case study from Russia. Overall, our results demonstrate that the COVID-19 crisis encompasses an excellent opportunity for urban planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more intelligent and sustainable.",2022.0,2022-06-14,30,92,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00664bcb5ec4f20a5bd7cb00711d48d29531dfe0
10.1101/2021.10.08.463027,Global Plant Extinction Risk Assessment Inform Novel Biodiversity Hotspots,"Curbing biodiversity loss and its impact on ecosystem services, resilience and Nature’s Contributions to People is one of the main challenges of our generation (IPBES, 2019b, 2019a; Secretariat of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020). A global baseline assessment of the threat status of all of biodiversity is crucial to monitor the progress of conservation policies worldwide (Mace & al., 2000; Secretariat of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, 2021) and target priority areas for conservation (Walker & al., 2021). However, the magnitude of the task seems insurmountable, as even listing the organisms already known to science is a challenge (Nic Lughadha & al., 2016; Borsch & al., 2020; Govaerts & al., 2021). A new approach is needed to overcome this stumbling block and scale-up the assessment of extinction risk. Here we show that analyses of natural history mega-datasets using artificial intelligence allows us to predict a baseline conservation status for all vascular plants and identify target areas for conservation corresponding to hotspots optimally capturing different aspects of biodiversity. We illustrate the strong potential of AI-based methods to reliably predict extinction risk on a global scale. Our approach not only retrieved recognized biodiversity hotspots but identified new areas that may guide future global conservation action (Myers & al., 2000; Brooks & al., 2006). To further work in this area and guide the targets of the post-2020 biodiversity framework (Díaz & al., 2020a; Secretariat of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020; Mair & al., 2021), it will be necessary to accelerate the acquisition of fundamental data and allow inclusion of social and economic factors (Possingham & Wilson, 2005).",2021.0,2021-10-09,0,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00665cf9b1ebbdbd66dd684d4f9b820c9fc58522

These include entities as diverse as Crohn’s disease, autism, diabetes, cancer or situations as prevalent today as obesity. In view of this situation, different recommendations have been performed regarding the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics as modulators of the microbiota and the microbiome, seeking both preventive and therapeutic effects, and faecal material transfer (FMT) is proposed as an alternative. The latter has emerged as the only proven beneficial intervention on the intestinal microbiome, specifically in the treatment of recurrent colitis associated with Clostridioides difficile (R-CDI). In the rest of the entities, the lowering of laboratory costs has favored the study of the microbiome, which is resolved by delivering reports with catalogs of microorganisms, metabolites or supposed biomarkers without consensus on their composition associated with healthy or diseased microbiota and the disease. There is still insufficient evidence in any disease for interventions on the microbiome beyond FMT and R-CDI.

In order to optimize the operation of a gas turbine, it is necessary to develop system identification models that allow for the development of studies and analyses to increase the system’s reliability. Current strategies for modeling complex and non-linear systems can be based on artificial intelligence techniques, using autoregressive neural networks of the NARX and LSTM type. In this context, this work aims to develop a model of a gas turbine capable of estimating the rotation speed of the turbine and simultaneously estimating the uncertainty associated with the estimation. These methodologies are based on artificial neural networks and the Monte Carlo dropout simulation method. The results were obtained from experimental data from a 215 MW gas turbine, getting the best model with a MAPE of 0.02% and an uncertainty associated with the turbine rotation speed of 2.2 RPM.",2024.0,2024-01-01,1,20,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0067a61c515bd4d10030da27adfab8b0597aea61

Initially, it was limited by poor image quality and short battery time, but due to technical improvements, it has become an equal diagnostic alternative to optical colonoscopy (OC). Hastened by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, CCE has been introduced in clinical practice to relieve overburdened endoscopy units and move investigations to out-patient clinics. A wider adoption of CCE would be bolstered by positive patient experience, as it offers a diagnostic investigation that is not inferior to other modalities. The shortcomings of CCE include its inability to differentiate adenomatous polyps from hyperplastic polyps. Solving this issue would improve the stratification of patients for polyp removal. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in polyp detection and characterization to minimize incomplete CCEs and avoid needless examinations. Onboard AI appears to be a needed application to enable near-real-time decision-making in order to diminish patient waiting times and avoid superfluous subsequent OCs.

10.21037/ATM.2019.12.102,Web-based study on Chinese dermatologists’ attitudes towards artificial intelligence,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool and is attracting more attention in the field of medicine. There are a number of AI studies focusing on skin diseases, and there are many AI products that have been applied in dermatology. However, the attitudes of dermatologists, specifically those from China, towards AI, is not clear as few, if any studies have focused on this issue. Methods A web-based questionnaire was designed by experts from the Chinese Skin Image Database (CSID) and published on the UMER Doctor platform (an online learning platform for dermatologists developed by the Shanghai Wheat Color Intelligent Technology Company, China). A total of 1,228 Chinese dermatologists were recruited and provided answers to the questionnaire online. The differences of dermatologists' attitudes towards AI among the different groups (stratified by age, gender, hospital level, education degree, professional title, and hospital ownership) were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The correlations between stratified factors and dermatologists’ attitudes towards AI were calculated by using the Spearman’s rank correlation test. SPSS (version 22.0) was utilized for all analyses. A two-sided P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses. Results A total of 1,228 Chinese dermatologists from 30 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and other regions (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) participated in this survey. The dermatologists who participated acquired AI-related information mainly through the Internet, meetings or forums, and 70.51% of participated dermatologists acquired AI-related information by two or more approaches. In total, 99.51% of participated dermatologists pay attention (general, passive-active, and active attention) to information pertaining to AI. Stratified analyses revealed statistically significant differences in their attention levels (unconcerned, general, passive-active, and active attention) to AI-related information by gender, hospital level, education degree, and professional title (P values ≤1.79E−02). In total, 95.36% of the participated dermatologists thought the role of AI to be in “assisting the daily diagnosis and treatment activities for dermatologists”. Stratified analyses about the thought of AI roles (unconcerned, useless, assist, and replace) showed that there was no statistically significant difference except for the hospital level (P value =4.09E−03). The correlations between stratified factors with attention levels and the opinions of AI roles showed extremely weak correlations. Furthermore, 64.17% of participated dermatologists thought secondary hospitals in China are in most need of the application AI, and 91.78% of participated dermatologists thought the priority implementation of AI should be in skin tumors. Conclusions The majority of Chinese dermatologists are interested in AI information and acquired information about AI through a variety of approaches. Nearly all dermatologists are attentive to information on AI and think the role of AI is in “assisting the daily diagnosis and treatment activities for dermatologists”. Future AI implementation should be primarily focused on skin tumors and utilized in in secondary hospitals.",2020.0,2020-06-01,21,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00691939060d805fe59d7d32c4c4a6a7f5cc4461

10.3390/app12178657,Building Better Digital Twins for Production Systems by Incorporating Environmental Related Functions—Literature Analysis and Determining Alternatives,"The digital twin solution is an industry 4.0 specific tool that has grown in the past decade, stemming from the modelling and simulation approaches that existed before, complemented by new sensor capabilities, cloud processing, big data analytics, and implementation mechanisms. As it is being used mostly in the present by manufacturing companies, the primary focus of the solution is to enhance productivity and reduce costs by optimizing processes and enabling real-time problem-solving, sometimes based on decision-making systems and artificial intelligence. However, as companies are being faced with an increasingly steep list of environmental requirements and regulations, ranging from the classical pollution control and waste recycling to full-scale economic models based on circular economy and transformative carbon dioxide elimination programs, the features of the manufacturing digital twins must also evolve to provide an appropriate answer to these challenges. In this paper, the authors propose a framework for building better digital twins for production systems by incorporating environmental-related functions. The demarches start from analysing existing solutions presented in literature from the point of view of environmental suitability, based on the use of the MoSCoW method for differentiating attributes (into Must have, Should have, Could have, Will not have elements) and determining development alternatives based on the employment of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for feature selection, and the TRIZ method (Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) for application guidelines. The MCDA was performed within a focus group of nine production specialists from regionally successful sectors. We arrive at the conclusion that environmental-related functions are poorly implemented in the digital twins of the present (although more so in integrated solutions and custom-built applications) and that the development of the proper tools, databases, and interpretation keys should proceed immediately in the fields of production engineering, industrial ecology, and software development to support them.",2022.0,2022-08-29,16,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00697929a6f957e8fbb06378c76d314441248dfc

10.3390/ijerph20156499,The Language of Nature and Artificial Intelligence in Patient Care,"Given the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and the conditions of vulnerability of large sectors of the population, the question emerges: what are the ethical limits of technologies in patient care? This paper examines this question in the light of the “language of nature” and of Aristotelian causal analysis, in particular the concept of means and ends. Thus, it is possible to point out the root of the distinction between the identity of the person and the entity of any technology. Nature indicates that the person is always an end in itself. Technology, on the contrary, should only be a means to serve the person. The diversity of their respective natures also explains why their respective agencies enjoy diverse scopes. Technological operations (artificial agency, artificial intelligence) find their meaning in the results obtained through them (poiesis). Moreover, the person is capable of actions whose purpose is precisely the action itself (praxis), in which personal agency and, ultimately, the person themselves, is irreplaceable. Forgetting the distinction between what, by nature, is an end and what can only be a means is equivalent to losing sight of the instrumental nature of AI and, therefore, its specific meaning: the greatest good of the patient. It is concluded that the language of nature serves as a filter that supports the effective subordination of the use of AI to its specific purpose, the human good. The greatest contribution of this work is to draw attention to the nature of the person and technology, and about their respective agencies.

10.3390/app10072376,Model-Informed Drug Discovery and Development Strategy for the Rapid Development of Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Combinations,"The increasing emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis requires new effective and safe drug regimens. However, drug discovery and development are challenging, lengthy and costly. The framework of model-informed drug discovery and development (MID3) is proposed to be applied throughout the preclinical to clinical phases to provide an informative prediction of drug exposure and efficacy in humans in order to select novel anti-tuberculosis drug combinations. The MID3 includes pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and quantitative systems pharmacology models, machine learning and artificial intelligence, which integrates all the available knowledge related to disease and the compounds. A translational in vitro-in vivo link throughout modeling and simulation is crucial to optimize the selection of regimens with the highest probability of receiving approval from regulatory authorities. In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling provide powerful tools to predict pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions based on preclinical information. Mechanistic or semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models have been successfully applied to predict the clinical exposure-response profile for anti-tuberculosis drugs using preclinical data. Potential pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions can be predicted from in vitro data through IVIVC and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling accounting for translational factors. It is essential for academic and industrial drug developers to collaborate across disciplines to realize the huge potential of MID3.",2020.0,2020-03-31,12,150,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006cc0a7ee64935d1ff7454efd6c724ca3a4dd6c

Remote manipulation devices extend human capabilities over vast distances or in inaccessible environments, removing constraints between patients and treatment. The integration of therapeutic and assistive devices with the Internet of Things (IoT) has demonstrated high potential to develop and enhance intelligent rehabilitation systems in the e‐health domain. Within such devices, soft robotic products distinguish themselves through their lightweight and adaptable characteristics, facilitating secure collaboration between humans and robots. The objective of this research is to combine a textile‐based sensorized glove with an air‐driven soft robotic glove, operated wirelessly using the developed control system architecture. The sensing glove equipped with capacitive sensors on each finger captures the movements of the medical staff's hand. Meanwhile, the pneumatic rehabilitation glove designed to aid patients affected by impaired hand function due to stroke, brain injury, or spinal cord injury replicates the movements of the medical personnel. The proposed artificial intelligence‐based system detects finger gestures and actuates the pneumatic system, responding within an average response time of 48.4 ms. The evaluation of the system further in terms of accuracy and transmission quality metrics verifies the feasibility of the proposed system integrating textile gloves into IoT infrastructure, enabling remote motion sensing and actuation.",2025.0,2025-02-17,0,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006d1ce3406e6d5ca71a9ddda35e75515108311b

10.1088/1361-6579/acf643,B3X: a novel efficient algorithm for accurate automated auscultatory blood pressure estimation,"Objective. The auscultatory technique is still considered the most accurate method for non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement, although its reliability depends on operator’s skills. Various methods for automated Korotkoff sounds analysis have been proposed for reliable estimation of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures. To this aim, very complex methodologies have been presented, including some based on artificial intelligence (AI). This study proposes a relatively simple methodology, named B3X, to estimate SBP and DBP by processing Korotkoff sounds recordings acquired during an auscultatory NIBP measurement. Approach. The beat-by-beat change in morphology of adjacent Korotkoff sounds is evaluated via their cross-correlation. The time series of the beat-by-beat cross-correlation and its first derivative are analyzed to locate the timings of SBP and DBP values. Extensive tests were performed on a public database of 350 annotated measurements, and the performance was evaluated according to the BHS, AAMI/ANSI, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) quality standards. Main results. The proposed approach achieved ‘A’ scores for SBP and DBP in the BHS grading system, and passed the quality tests of AAMI/ANSI and ISO standards. The B3X algorithm outperformed two well-established algorithms for oscillometric NIBP measurement in both SBP and DBP estimation. It also outperformed four AI-based algorithms in DBP estimation, while providing comparable performance for SBP, at the cost of a much lower computational burden. The full code of the B3X algorithm is provided in a public repository. Significance. The very good performances ensured by the proposed B3X algorithm, at a low computational cost and without the need for parameter training, support its direct implementation into clinical blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices. The results of this study pave the way for solving/overcoming the trade-off between the accuracy of the auscultatory technique and the objectivity of oscillatory measurements, by bringing an automated auscultatory BP measurement method in clinical practice.",2023.0,2023-09-02,1,64,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006d4c22d58abc2d87b1b651525f819e4969f186
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3397616,FEA Simulations for Thermal Distributions of Large Scale 3DIC Packages,"As the market increases for Artificial Intelligence and High-Performance Computing applications, the geometry of 3-Dimensional Integrated Circuit packages becomes more complicated; therefore, predicting the thermal distributions of the structures becomes not only more important but also more challenging. The physics governing the thermal distribution is a 3-dimensional partial differential equation. In order to predict the thermal distributions, various approaches such as the layer modeling method have been invented. While practical, these approaches solve a simplified version of the differential equation placing an inherent limitation on their capabilities which may be improved upon. In this research we solve the actual differential equation using Finite Element Analysis. Finite Element Analysis is known to produce accurate solutions, albeit being computationally intensive, and may take days to run even with a powerful computer, making it impractical for some applications. In this paper, we present case studies of computing the thermal distributions of large scale 3-dimensional integrated circuit models using XSim. We find that XSim’s solving capabilities are capable of computing accurate thermal distributions of large-scale models in minutes instead of days. This suggests a new way to compute the thermal distributions rapidly and accurately for large 3-Dimensional Integrated Circuit packages, which may bring potential benefits in research, design and development of 3-Dimensional Integrated Circuit packages.",2024.0,,1,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006d81022148dd5d820e7d44519e72b62c557d36

DNA is strongly nominated by researchers in this field to exceed other data covering mediums like video, image, and text due to its structural characteristics. Features like enormous hiding capacity, high computational power, and the randomness of its building contents, all sustained to prove DNA supremacy. There are mainly three types of DNA-based algorithms. These are insertion, substitution, and complementary rule-based algorithms. In the last few years, a new generation of DNA-based steganography approaches has been proposed by researchers. These modern algorithms overpass the performance of the old ones either by exploiting a biological factor that exists in the DNA itself or by using a suitable technique available in another field of computer science like artificial intelligence, data structure, networking, etc. The main goal of this paper is to thoroughly analyze these modern DNA-based steganography approaches. This will be achieved by explaining their working mechanisms, stating their pros and cons, and proposing suggestions to improve these methods. Additionally, a biological background about DNA structure, the main security parameters, and classical concealing approaches will be illustrated to give a comprehensive picture of the field.

10.3390/electronics12010028,Design and Implementation: An IoT-Framework-Based Automated Wastewater Irrigation System,"Automation is being fueled by a multifaceted approach to technological advancements, which includes advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, sensors, and cloud computing. The use of automated, as opposed to conventional, systems, has become more popular in recent years. Modern agricultural technology has played an important role in the development of Saudi Arabia in addition to upgrading infrastructure and plans. Agriculture in Saudi Arabia is dependent upon wells, which are insufficient in terms of water supplies. Thus, irrigation is used for agricultural fields, depending on the soil type, and water is provided to the plants. Two essential elements are necessary for farming, the first is the ability to determine the soil’s fertility, and the second is the use of different technologies to reduce the dependence of water on electrical power and on/off schedules. The purpose of this study is to propose a system in which moisture sensors are placed under trees or plants. The gateway unit transmits sensor information to the controller, which then turns on the pump and recycles the water flow. A farmland’s water pump can be remotely controlled and parameters such as moisture and flow rate can be monitored using an HTTP dashboard.

Ten continuous and categorical flood conditioning factors were chosen based on the 201 flood locations, including topographic wetness index (TWI), river density, stream power index (SPI), curvature, distance from river, lithology, elevation, ground slope, land use, and rainfall. The step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) model was adopted for the assessment of relationship between flood locations and conditioning factors. The ANFIS model, based on SWARA weights, was employed for providing FSMs with three optimization models to enhance the accuracy of prediction. To evaluate the model performance and prediction capability, root-mean-square error (RMSE) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under the ROC (AUROC)) were used. Results showed that ANFIS-IWO with lower RMSE (0.359) had a better performance, while ANFIS-BA with higher AUROC (94.4%) showed a better prediction capability, followed by ANFIS0-IWO (0.939) and ANFIS-CA (0.921).

It is a general descriptor of water properties in terms of physical, chemical, thermal, and/or biological characteristics. Laboratory analysis is used to measure and analyze water quality parameter, however, it is a conventional, time-consuming, and expensive approach often providing discrete data at a single point in space and time and making it difficult to characterize a larger waterbody, while remote sensing methods is a cost effective and accurate methods of water quality monitoring with a high spatial and temporal resolution for large area of waterbodies. To this end, this review focused on novel findings in the field of water quality estimation using remote sensing techniques, and the result revealed that remote sensing method has used to retrieve water quality parameters which are optically active (Chlorophyll-a, Secchi Disk depth, Water temperature, Turbidity, Total Suspended Matter, Electrical conductivity, Sea Surface Salinity and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter), and optically non active (Dissolved Oxygen, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Total Nitrogen, Ammonia Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus).

10.1371/journal.pone.0267851,Using deep transfer learning to detect scoliosis and spondylolisthesis from x-ray images,"Recent years have witnessed wider prevalence of vertebral column pathologies due to lifestyle changes, sedentary behaviors, or injuries. Spondylolisthesis and scoliosis are two of the most common ailments with an incidence of 5% and 3% in the United States population, respectively. Both of these abnormalities can affect children at a young age and, if left untreated, can progress into severe pain. Moreover, severe scoliosis can even lead to lung and heart problems. Thus, early diagnosis can make it easier to apply remedies/interventions and prevent further disease progression. Current diagnosis methods are based on visual inspection by physicians of radiographs and/or calculation of certain angles (e.g., Cobb angle). Traditional artificial intelligence-based diagnosis systems utilized these parameters to perform automated classification, which enabled fast and easy diagnosis supporting tools. However, they still require the specialists to perform error-prone tedious measurements. To this end, automated measurement tools were proposed based on processing techniques of X-ray images. In this paper, we utilize advances in deep transfer learning to diagnose spondylolisthesis and scoliosis from X-ray images without the need for any measurements. We collected raw data from real X-ray images of 338 subjects (i.e., 188 scoliosis, 79 spondylolisthesis, and 71 healthy). Deep transfer learning models were developed to perform three-class classification as well as pair-wise binary classifications among the three classes. The highest mean accuracy and maximum accuracy for three-class classification was 96.73% and 98.02%, respectively. Regarding pair-wise binary classification, high accuracy values were achieved for most of the models (i.e., > 98%). These results and other performance metrics reflect a robust ability to diagnose the subjects’ vertebral column disorders from standard X-ray images.

10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039474,"Evaluation of a wearable wireless device with artificial intelligence, iThermonitor WT705, for continuous temperature monitoring for patients in surgical wards: a prospective comparative study","Objectives To evaluate a new-generation, non-invasive, wireless axillary thermometer with artificial intelligence, iThermonitor (WT705, Raiing Medical, Beijing, China), and to ascertain its feasibility for perioperative continuous body temperature monitoring in surgical patients. Setting Departments of Biliary Surgery and Operating Room and the post-anaesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital in Chengdu, China. Participants A total of 526 adult surgical patients were consecutively enrolled. Design This was a prospective observational study. Axillary temperatures were continuously recorded with iThermonitor throughout the whole perioperative period. The temperatures of the contralateral armpit were measured with mercury thermometers at 8:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 every day and were used as references. Outcome measures The outcomes were the accuracy and precision of the temperatures measured with iThermonitor, the validity to detect fever and the feasibility of continuous wear. Pairs of temperatures were evaluated with Student’s t-test, Pearson’s correlation and repeated-measures Bland-Altman plot. Results A total of 3621 pairs of body temperatures were obtained. The temperatures measured with iThermonitor agreed with those measured with the mercury thermometers overall, with a mean difference of 0.03°C±0.35°C and a moderate correlation (r=0.755, p<0.001). The 95% limits of agreement (LoA) ranged from −0.63°C to 0.73°C, with 5.11% of the differences outside the 95% LoA. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.753. Continuous temperature monitoring captured more fevers than intermittent observation (117/526 vs 91/526, p<0.001), detected fever up to 4.35 hours earlier, and captured a higher peak temperature (0.29°C±0.27°C, 95% CI: 0.26–0.31). All subjects felt that wearing iThermonitor was more or less comfortable and did not affect their daily activities. Conclusions iThermonitor is promising for continuous remote temperature monitoring in surgical patients. However, further developments are still needed to improve the precision of this device, especially for temperature detection in underweight patients and those with lower body temperature.

10.3390/su16156472,Associations between Grand Challenges and Multinational Enterprises: A Bibliometric and Thematic Analysis,"Grand challenges are defined as wicked problems that affect a significant number of people on a global scale. To overcome these challenges and ensure the continued existence of humanity, a greater focus has been placed on addressing the underlying issues. This has led to an increase in research and literature on grand challenges affecting both international business and multinational enterprises. The aim of this study is to assess the status of grand challenge literature in all areas connected to multinational enterprises and grand challenges, which are global issues with significant implications. From 2013 to 2023, the Web of Science database was used to investigate eight search terms from the literature, and bibliometric and thematic analyses were carried out based on the principles of the systematic literature analysis. The most focused areas of the research are performance, foreign direct investment, management, firms’ innovation, knowledge, corporate social responsibility, international business, and impact. Asian, African, European, and other countries may emerge together in different clusters depending on whether the grand challenges they are struggling with are similar or identical. The terms ‘grand challenges’, ‘innovation’ (open and social), ‘technology transfer’, ‘R&D internalization’, ‘digital transformation’, ‘technology’ and ‘artificial intelligence’ in the literature of multinational enterprises indicate that these themes are used as tools to solve grand challenges.",2024.0,2024-07-29,2,53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0078fdcbe1c6f5c8aa4e6fb4e40228082db75976

10.1371/journal.pone.0273941,COVID-19 and public support for autonomous technologies—Did the pandemic catalyze a world of robots?,"By introducing a novel risk to human interaction, COVID-19 may have galvanized interest in uses of artificial intelligence (AI). But was the pandemic a large enough catalyst to change public attitudes about the costs and benefits of autonomous systems whose operations increasingly rely on AI? To answer this question, we use a preregistered research design that exploits variation across the 2018 and 2020 waves of the CCES/CES, a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States. We compare support for autonomous cars, autonomous surgeries, weapons, and cyber defense pre- and post-the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that, despite the incentives created by COVID-19, the pandemic did not increase support for most of these technologies, except in the case of autonomous surgery among those who know someone who died of COVID-19. The results hold even when controlling for a variety of relevant political and demographic factors. The pandemic did little to push potential autonomous vehicle users to support adoption. Further, American concerns about autonomous weapons, including cyber defense, remain sticky and perhaps exacerbated over the last two years. These findings suggest that the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of many of these systems is far more nuanced and complex than headlines may suggest.",2022.0,2022-09-28,2,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007ad29ec998b8544afa4032b4dd57b40ff1e3ef
10.1371/journal.pdig.0000394,The First Generative AI Prompt-A-Thon in Healthcare: A Novel Approach to Workforce Engagement with a Private Instance of ChatGPT,"Background Healthcare crowdsourcing events (e.g. hackathons) facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and encourage innovation. Peer-reviewed research has not yet considered a healthcare crowdsourcing event focusing on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), which generates text in response to detailed prompts and has vast potential for improving the efficiency of healthcare organizations. Our event, the New York University Langone Health (NYULH) Prompt-a-thon, primarily sought to inspire and build AI fluency within our diverse NYULH community, and foster collaboration and innovation. Secondarily, we sought to analyze how participants’ experience was influenced by their prior GenAI exposure and whether they received sample prompts during the workshop. Methods Executing the event required the assembly of an expert planning committee, who recruited diverse participants, anticipated technological challenges, and prepared the event. The event was composed of didactics and workshop sessions, which educated and allowed participants to experiment with using GenAI on real healthcare data. Participants were given novel “project cards” associated with each dataset that illuminated the tasks GenAI could perform and, for a random set of teams, sample prompts to help them achieve each task (the public repository of project cards can be found at https://github.com/smallw03/NYULH-Generative-AI-Prompt-a-thon-Project-Cards). Afterwards, participants were asked to fill out a survey with 7-point Likert-style questions. Results Our event was successful in educating and inspiring hundreds of enthusiastic in-person and virtual participants across our organization on the responsible use of GenAI in a low-cost and technologically feasible manner. All participants responded positively, on average, to each of the survey questions (e.g., confidence in their ability to use and trust GenAI). Critically, participants reported a self-perceived increase in their likelihood of using and promoting colleagues’ use of GenAI for their daily work. No significant differences were seen in the surveys of those who received sample prompts with their project task descriptions Conclusion The first healthcare Prompt-a-thon was an overwhelming success, with minimal technological failures, positive responses from diverse participants and staff, and evidence of post-event engagement. These findings will be integral to planning future events at our institution, and to others looking to engage their workforce in utilizing GenAI.",2024.0,2024-07-01,1,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007b1516308e4bfc4dfac6af6d42fc2b4a9815f2

10.36941/ajis-2019-0015,Image of God and Image of Human Being: A Philosophical Investigation of the God-Human and Human-Machine Relationships,"One of the answers to the question of the human nature was provided by the mystical philosophers such as Ibn ‘Arab ī through the theory of divine form of human being. This theory in Judeo-Christian tradition is known as imago Dei. It means God created human being in His image/form. The main effort of the scholars in both Judeo-Christian and Islamic tradition has been to interpret the imago Dei and to find an explanation for man-God relationship. The present paper indicated that the meaning and functions of the theory could be understood in the light of philosophical investigations on the artificial intelligence. The paper outlined the wish of God to be seen outside of His Essence in His ‘image’ (human) based on Ibn‘Arab ī ’s interpretation. Then, we indicated that human being similarly tries to find the ‘other’ outside of his being, AI-based machines, to see his potentialities in his form (machines). Man can know himself through other (machine) which has similarities with him. We argued that this investigation helps to understand more explicit meaning of the theory and the goal of creation of the human being based on the interpretation of imago Dei in Ibn‘Arab ī ’s perspective. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensible meaning of imago Dei based on Ibn ‘Arab ī ’s interpretation regarding the philosophical bases of the need for AI-based machines. The method that used for this investigation is the conceptual analysis; also, we considered pluridisciplinary which opens new possibilities of understanding of the meanings in art and philosophy.",2019.0,2019-11-10,0,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007cdc4264548aee65fd736c6d33340142e65be2

Our research results show five profiles of entrepreneurs, mainly differentiated by age and entrepreneurial motives, as well as the identification of relevant skills, capacities, and capabilities for entrepreneurship, such as creativity, learning, and leadership. The sample consists of 633 young people aged between 14 and 28 years in Medellín. The data treatment was approached through cluster analysis using the K-means algorithm to obtain information about the underlying nature and structure of the data. These data analysis techniques provide valuable information that can help to better understand the behaviour of Colombian entrepreneurs. They also reveal hidden information in the data. Therefore, one of the advantages of using statistical and artificial intelligence techniques in this type of study is to extract valuable information that might otherwise go unnoticed. The clusters generated show correlations with profiles that can support the design of policies in Colombia to promote an entrepreneurial ecosystem and the creation and development of new businesses through business regulation.",2023.0,2023-06-29,1,73,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007d6e6be042e11559022f7a4141a7bb8701f5a1

10.25073/2588-1086/VNUCSCE.267,An Elasticity Framework for Distributed Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Brokers,"Internet of Things (IoT) applications are increasingly making impact in all areas of humanlife. Day by day, its chatty embedded devices have been generating tons of data requiring effectivenetwork infrastructure. To deliver millions of IoT messages back and fort with as few faults aspossible, participation of communication protocols like MQTT is a must. Lightweight blueprintand friendly battery are just two of many advantages of this protocol making it become a dominantin IoT world. In real application scenarios, distributed MQTT solutions are usually required sincecentralized MQTT approach is incapable of dealing with huge amount of data. Although distributedMQTT solutions are scalable, they do not adapt to fluctuations of traffic workload. This might costIoT service provider because of redundant computation resources. This leads to the need of a novelapproach that can adapt its size changes in workload. This article proposes such an elastic solutionby proposing a flexible MQTT framework. Our MQTT framework uses off-the-shelf componentsto obtain server’s elasticity while keeping IoT applications intact. Experiments are conducted tovalidate elasticity function provided by an implementation of our framework.

10.3390/s22010279,Physical Distancing Device with Edge Computing for COVID-19 (PADDIE-C19),"The most effective methods of preventing COVID-19 infection include maintaining physical distancing and wearing a face mask while in close contact with people in public places. However, densely populated areas have a greater incidence of COVID-19 dissemination, which is caused by people who do not comply with standard operating procedures (SOPs). This paper presents a prototype called PADDIE-C19 (Physical Distancing Device with Edge Computing for COVID-19) to implement the physical distancing monitoring based on a low-cost edge computing device. The PADDIE-C19 provides real-time results and responses, as well as notifications and warnings to anyone who violates the 1-m physical distance rule. In addition, PADDIE-C19 includes temperature screening using an MLX90614 thermometer and ultrasonic sensors to restrict the number of people on specified premises. The Neural Network Processor (KPU) in Grove Artificial Intelligence Hardware Attached on Top (AI HAT), an edge computing unit, is used to accelerate the neural network model on person detection and achieve up to 18 frames per second (FPS). The results show that the accuracy of person detection with Grove AI HAT could achieve 74.65% and the average absolute error between measured and actual physical distance is 8.95 cm. Furthermore, the accuracy of the MLX90614 thermometer is guaranteed to have less than 0.5 °C value difference from the more common Fluke 59 thermometer. Experimental results also proved that when cloud computing is compared to edge computing, the Grove AI HAT achieves the average performance of 18 FPS for a person detector (kmodel) with an average 56 ms execution time in different networks, regardless of the network connection type or speed.",2021.0,2021-12-30,3,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0081723367a54da78b39dc85d6ebf1318a1b2b47

To summarize how big data and artificial intelligence technologies have evolved, their current state, and next steps to enable future generations of artificial intelligence for ophthalmology.


RECENT FINDINGS
Big data in health care is ever increasing in volume and variety, enabled by the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and standards for health data information exchange, such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. Simultaneously, the development of powerful cloud-based storage and computing architectures supports a fertile environment for big data and artificial intelligence in health care. The high volume and velocity of imaging and structured data in ophthalmology and is one of the reasons why ophthalmology is at the forefront of artificial intelligence research. Still needed are consensus labeling conventions for performing supervised learning on big data, promotion of data sharing and reuse, standards for sharing artificial intelligence model architectures, and access to artificial intelligence models through open application program interfaces (APIs).


SUMMARY
Future requirements for big data and artificial intelligence include fostering reproducible science, continuing open innovation, and supporting the clinical use of artificial intelligence by promoting standards for data labels, data sharing, artificial intelligence model architecture sharing, and accessible code and APIs.",2020.0,2020-07-09,35,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00825fd3c7c7d216f6f5bf6b7f18d4818d3a378c

10.3390/fi12110196,Proposal and Investigation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Based Cloud Resource Allocation Algorithm in Network Function Virtualization Architectures,"The high time needed to reconfigure cloud resources in Network Function Virtualization network environments has led to the proposal of solutions in which a prediction based-resource allocation is performed. All of them are based on traffic or needed resource prediction with the minimization of symmetric loss functions like Mean Squared Error. When inevitable prediction errors are made, the prediction methodologies are not able to differently weigh positive and negative prediction errors that could impact the total network cost. In fact if the predicted traffic is higher than the real one then an over allocation cost, referred to as over-provisioning cost, will be paid by the network operator; conversely, in the opposite case, Quality of Service degradation cost, referred to as under-provisioning cost, will be due to compensate the users because of the resource under allocation. In this paper we propose and investigate a resource allocation strategy based on a Long Short Term Memory algorithm in which the training operation is based on the minimization of an asymmetric cost function that differently weighs the positive and negative prediction errors and the corresponding over-provisioning and under-provisioning costs. In a typical traffic and network scenario, the proposed solution allows for a cost saving by 30% with respect to the case of solution with symmetric cost function.",2020.0,2020-11-13,10,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00832f1172c46c5de07f3b460dc92b3fe711e0fb
10.2196/54029,Development of an Artificial Intelligence–Based Tailored Mobile Intervention for Nurse Burnout: Single-Arm Trial,"Background Nurse burnout leads to an increase in turnover, which is a serious problem in the health care system. Although there is ample evidence of nurse burnout, interventions developed in previous studies were general and did not consider specific burnout dimensions and individual characteristics. Objective The objectives of this study were to develop and optimize the first tailored mobile intervention for nurse burnout, which recommends programs based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, and to test its usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction. Methods In this study, an AI-based mobile intervention, Nurse Healing Space, was developed to provide tailored programs for nurse burnout. The 4-week program included mindfulness meditation, laughter therapy, storytelling, reflective writing, and acceptance and commitment therapy. The AI algorithm recommended one of these programs to participants by calculating similarity through a pretest consisting of participants’ demographics, research variables, and burnout dimension scores measured with the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. After completing a 4-week program, burnout, job stress, stress response using the Stress Response Inventory Modified Form, the usability of the app, coping strategy by the coping strategy indicator, and program satisfaction (1: very dissatisfied; 5: very satisfied) were measured. The AI recognized the recommended program as effective if the user’s burnout score reduced after the 2-week program and updated the algorithm accordingly. After a pilot test (n=10), AI optimization was performed (n=300). A paired 2-tailed t test, ANOVA, and the Spearman correlation were used to test the effect of the intervention and algorithm optimization. Results Nurse Healing Space was implemented as a mobile app equipped with a system that recommended 1 program out of 4 based on similarity between users through AI. The AI algorithm worked well in matching the program recommended to participants who were most similar using valid data. Users were satisfied with the convenience and visual quality but were dissatisfied with the absence of notifications and inability to customize the program. The overall usability score of the app was 3.4 out of 5 points. Nurses’ burnout scores decreased significantly after the completion of the first 2-week program (t=7.012; P<.001) and reduced further after the second 2-week program (t=2.811; P=.01). After completing the Nurse Healing Space program, job stress (t=6.765; P<.001) and stress responses (t=5.864; P<.001) decreased significantly. During the second 2-week program, the burnout level reduced in the order of participation (r=–0.138; P=.04). User satisfaction increased for both the first (F=3.493; P=.03) and second programs (F=3.911; P=.02). Conclusions This program effectively reduced burnout, job stress, and stress responses. Nurse managers were able to prevent nurses from resigning and maintain the quality of medical services using this AI-based program to provide tailored interventions for nurse burnout. Thus, this app could improve qualitative health care, increase employee satisfaction, reduce costs, and ultimately improve the efficiency of the health care system.",2024.0,2024-06-21,4,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008372366afd08733661b1ddc439a9b2bf2bce7f

It is a challenging task for a computer vision to recognize as same as humans through AI. Face detection plays a vital role in emotion recognition. Emotions are classified as happy, sad, disgust, angry, neutral, fear, and surprise. Other aspects such as speech, eye contact, frequency of the voice, and heartbeat are considered. Nowadays face recognition is more efficient and used for many real-time applications due to security purposes. We detect emotion by scanning (static) images or with the (dynamic) recording. Features extracting can be done like eyes, nose, and mouth for face detection. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm follows steps as max-pooling (maximum feature extraction) and flattening.",2019.0,2019-11-30,11,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0083a957cdba73dfbb7e8d1fc1b5ba22c221615a

AI operates through the utilization of specialized algorithms, and it includes techniques such as deep (DL), and machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP). As a result, AI has found its application in the study of pharmaceutical chemistry and healthcare. The AI models employed encompass a spectrum of methodologies, including unsupervised clustering techniques applied to drugs or patients to discern potential drug compounds or appropriate patient cohorts. Additionally, supervised ML methodologies are utilized to enhance the efficacy of therapeutic drug monitoring. Further, AI-aided prediction of the clinical outcomes of clinical trials can improve efficiency by prioritizing therapeutic intervention that are likely to succeed, hence benefiting the patient. AI may also help create personalized treatments by locating potential intervention targets and assessing their efficacy. Hence, this review provides insights into recent advances in the application of AI and different tools used in the field of pharmaceutical medicine.",2024.0,2024-03-01,1,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0087e8dde3d13ba543e74995d92ae86144a6bd70
10.1101/133504,Deep Neural Networks in Computational Neuroscience,"The goal of computational neuroscience is to find mechanistic explanations of how the nervous system processes information to give rise to cognitive function and behaviour. At the heart of the field are its models, i.e. mathematical and computational descriptions of the system being studied, which map sensory stimuli to neural responses and/or neural to behavioural responses. These models range from simple to complex. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term “neural network” suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNNs neglect many details of biological neural networks. These simplifications contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling them to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs excel at predicting neural responses to novel sensory stimuli with accuracies well beyond any other currently available model type. DNNs can have millions of parameters, which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for successful task performance. Contrary to the intuition that this renders them into impenetrable black boxes, the computational properties of the network units are the result of four directly manipulable elements: input statistics, network structure, functional objective, and learning algorithm. With full access to the activity and connectivity of all units, advanced visualization techniques, and analytic tools to map network representations to neural data, DNNs represent a powerful framework for building task-performing models and will drive substantial insights in computational neuroscience.",2018.0,2018-06-05,168,160,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0088113537d166efc0384a710aed99dddfa73184

10.15802/ampr.v0i24.295317,Artificial Intelligence as a Socio-Cultural Phenomenon: the Educational Dimension,"Purpose. The study aims to understand artificial intelligence as a socio-cultural phenomenon and its impact on education, where the spiritual sphere of humanity, moral norms, values, and human cognitive abilities are preserved, transferred as well as reproduced. A new discourse on the interaction of artificial and authentic human intelligence becomes inevitable, which has led to a situation of uncertainty. Changes in the socio-cultural environment under the influence of artificial intelligence increase potential threats to the educational space, which stimulates to find the ways to eliminate them. Theoretical basis. Various approaches of classical and postmodern philosophical heritage were taken as a theoretical basis for the research. The originality of the study is in the interpretation of artificial intelligence as a modern form of alienation of essential human characteristics in the socio-cultural context of information technology. The expansion of artificial intelligence raises awareness of the existential threat to the basic socio-cultural, moral and ethical principles of humanism. It is proved that various forms of alienation in the current existing socio-cultural space are typical of our reality, which changes the system of values, moral principles, and social organization of the community. Conclusions. In conclusion, it is proved that AI is a natural stage of scientific and technological progress, which reflects its secondary, derivative nature from human (authentic) intelligence. Human intelligence will always have advantages over AI due to its ability to create, communicate socially and culturally, and be emotional. The dilemma of the counterbalance between human and artificial intelligence is perceived mainly at the emotional level of people. The millennial understanding of the primacy of the creator over his creation can traditionally overcome this contradiction. The universality of human thinking is an undeniable advantage of human intelligence and a guarantee of its, i.e. our, priority.",2023.0,2023-12-29,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0089b7c8508f9e349d34fe2c77960383ae09b99f

However, the current digitalization level of cage aquaculture is low, and the farming risks are high. Research and development of digital management of the fish population in cages are greatly desired. Real-time monitoring of the activity status of the fish population and changes in the fish population size in cages is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. This paper proposes an improved network called CC-YOLOv5 by embedding CoordConv modules to replace the original ConV convolution modules in the network, which improves the model’s generalization capability. By using two-stage detection logic, the target detection accuracy is enhanced to realize prediction of the number of fish populations. OpenCV is then used to measure fish tail lengths to establish growth curves of the fish and to predict the output of the fish population in the cages. Experimental results demonstrate that the mean average precision (mAP) of the improved algorithm increases by 14.9% compared to the original YOLOv5, reaching 95.4%. This research provides an effective solution to promote the intelligentization of cage aquaculture processes.

Theoretical basis. The research base is the practical communicative philosophy. Originality. It lies in the fact that the article considered a moral interaction between a person and artificial intelligence. Conclusions. Nowadays modern digital technologies have acquired a new importance. Previously, they were only passive assistants. But now they are able to actively influence human nature not only from the outside, yet also from the inside. Now they influence not only the form of thoughts but also their character. It is artificial intelligence that is the cause of the phenomenon of the ""information bubble"" (""echo chamber""). They are formed by mathematical algorithms for each individual user of the Internet. It is because of these algorithms, which are the basis of artificial intelligence, that we can conclude: they are guided only by strategic rationality. Therefore, they relate to the Internet user only as an object. That is why such a situation can also be a manifestation of the expansion of strategic rationality into the lifeworld, which gives rise to social pathologies. New digital technologies (first of all, social networks) are becoming an integral part of a person’s everyday life, and therefore the background of his/her life world. Virtual life becomes an important part of real life. However, virtual life is formed by the influence of the information stream, which constantly sets new ""trends"", including ""trends"" on morality. That is why a person begins to perceive only those events that are contained in this stream. Moreover, s\he can express his\her empathy only when s/he him/herself is able to join this stream and express it in virtual life.",2023.0,2023-06-30,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008c6b9ffc5a44e649c27edfea8849856753e5c1

10.1002/aisy.202200026,Mixed‐Precision Continual Learning Based on Computational Resistance Random Access Memory,"Artificial neural networks have acquired remarkable achievements in the field of artificial intelligence. However, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting when dealing with continual learning problems, i.e., the loss of previously learned knowledge upon learning new information. Although several continual learning algorithms have been proposed, it remains a challenge to implement these algorithms efficiently on conventional digital systems due to the physical separation between memory and processing units. Herein, a software–hardware codesigned in‐memory computing paradigm is proposed, where a mixed‐precision continual learning (MPCL) model is deployed on a hybrid analogue–digital hardware system equipped with resistance random access memory chip. Software‐wise, the MPCL effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and circumvents the requirement for high‐precision weights. Hardware‐wise, the hybrid analogue–digital system takes advantage of the colocation of memory and processing units, greatly improving energy efficiency. By combining the MPCL with an in situ fine‐tuning method, high classification accuracies of 94.9% and 95.3% (software baseline 97.0% and 97.7%) on the 5‐split‐MNIST and 5‐split‐FashionMNIST are achieved, respectively.

Menstrual hygiene is a global concern because there are over 0.6 billion teenage females (about 8% of the population). The Asian and African continents are home to over 80% of these teenagers. Throughout, 355 million girls and women in India have periods. However, MHM causes discomfort and a lack of respect for millions of women all over the country. In alignment with today's technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT), the MHM can be handled effectively. A quantitative survey was carried out among 184 random volunteers aged 18-22 to reveal the current status of MHM in India.

This facilitated an early diagnosis by the biopsy of AL cardiac amyloidosis and the prompt initiation of targeted therapy. This case highlights the utilization of an AI clinical tool and its impact on clinical care, particularly for the early detection of a rare and difficult to diagnose condition where early therapy is critical.",2024.0,2024-05-24,0,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008ee0853367d021b8794ea482112d443a07c043

Not only can the efficiency of crystallization/production processes and product quality be increased but also new equipment can be qualitatively characterized. A large variety of analytical methods for PSDs is available, most of which have underlying assumptions and corresponding errors affecting the measurement of the volume of individual particles. In this work we present a method for the determination of particle volumes in a bulk sample via micro-computed tomography and the application of artificial intelligence. The particle size of bulk samples of sucrose were measured with this method and compared to classical indirect measurement methods. Advantages of the workflow are presented.",2023.0,2023-01-21,6,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008ee322893e2afbe6336a69ffc8c4ac8c2c6f70
10.3390/ijtm2010002,Artificial Intelligence and Democratization of the Use of Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19: On the Feasibility of Automatic Calculation of Lung Ultrasound Score,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, lung ultrasound has been revealed as a powerful technique for diagnosis and follow-up of pneumonia, the principal complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, being a relatively new and unknown technique, the lack of trained personnel has limited its application worldwide. Computer-aided diagnosis could possibly help to reduce the learning curve for less experienced physicians, and to extend such a new technique such as lung ultrasound more quickly. This work presents the preliminary results of the ULTRACOV (Ultrasound in Coronavirus disease) study, aimed to explore the feasibility of a real-time image processing algorithm for automatic calculation of the lung ultrasound score (LUS). A total of 28 patients positive on COVID-19 were recruited and scanned in 12 thorax zones following the lung score protocol, saving a 3 s video at each probe position. Those videos were evaluated by an experienced physician and by a custom developed automated detection algorithm, looking for A-Lines, B-Lines, consolidations, and pleural effusions. The agreement between the findings of the expert and the algorithm was 88.0% for B-Lines, 93.4% for consolidations and 99.7% for pleural effusion detection, and 72.8% for the individual video score. The standard deviation of the patient lung score difference between the expert and the algorithm was ±2.2 points over 36. The exam average time with the ULTRACOV prototype was 5.3 min, while with a conventional scanner was 12.6 min. Conclusion: A good agreement between the algorithm output and an experienced physician was observed, which is a first step on the feasibility of developing a real-time aided-diagnosis lung ultrasound equipment. Additionally, the examination time was reduced to less than half with regard to a conventional ultrasound exam. Acquiring a complete lung ultrasound exam within a few minutes is possible using fairly simple ultrasound machines that are enhanced with artificial intelligence, such as the one we propose. This step is critical to democratize the use of lung ultrasound in these difficult times.",2022.0,2022-01-13,10,12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008f8dc46e65150cc570aad5715481c9319427ff

10.3390/s21175723,Safe Hb Concentration Measurement during Bladder Irrigation Using Artificial Intelligence,"We have developed a sensor for monitoring the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration in the effluent of a continuous bladder irrigation. The Hb concentration measurement is based on light absorption within a fixed measuring distance. The light frequency used is selected so that both arterial and venous Hb are equally detected. The sensor allows the measurement of the Hb concentration up to a maximum value of 3.2 g/dL (equivalent to ≈20% blood concentration). Since bubble formation in the outflow tract cannot be avoided with current irrigation systems, a neural network is implemented that can robustly detect air bubbles within the measurement section. The network considers both optical and temporal features and is able to effectively safeguard the measurement process. The sensor supports the use of different irrigants (salt and electrolyte-free solutions) as well as measurement through glass shielding. The sensor can be used in a non-invasive way with current irrigation systems. The sensor is positively tested in a clinical study.",2021.0,2021-08-25,3,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0091fa7e5a77675e02d48f7958f0ba68c0cc8d2d

10.1055/a-1522-3029,The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Automation in the Fields of Gynaecology and Obstetrics – an Assessment of the State of Play,"Abstract The long-awaited progress in digitalisation is generating huge amounts of medical data every day, and manual analysis and targeted, patient-oriented evaluation of this data is becoming increasingly difficult or even infeasible. This state of affairs and the associated, increasingly complex requirements for individualised precision medicine underline the need for modern software solutions and algorithms across the entire healthcare system. The utilisation of state-of-the-art equipment and techniques in almost all areas of medicine over the past few years has now indeed enabled automation processes to enter – at least in part – into routine clinical practice. Such systems utilise a wide variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the majority of which have been developed to optimise medical image reconstruction, noise reduction, quality assurance, triage, segmentation, computer-aided detection and classification and, as an emerging field of research, radiogenomics. Tasks handled by AI are completed significantly faster and more precisely, clearly demonstrated by now in the annual findings of the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVCR), first conducted in 2015, with error rates well below those of humans. This review article will discuss the potential capabilities and currently available applications of AI in gynaecological-obstetric diagnostics. The article will focus, in particular, on automated techniques in prenatal sonographic diagnostics. Zusammenfassung Mit dem Fortschreiten der längst notwendigen Digitalisierung werden täglich riesige Mengen an medizinischen Daten generiert, deren manuelle Analyse und zielgerichtete patientenorientierte Auswertung zunehmend schwieriger bis unmöglich wird. Dieser Umstand und die damit verbundenen, immer komplexer werdenden Anforderungen an eine individualisierte Präzisionsmedizin verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit moderner Softwarelösungen und Algorithmen im gesamten Gesundheitswesen. Tatsächlich haben in den letzten Jahren in nahezu allen Bereichen der Medizin mit dem Einsatz modernster Apparaturen und Techniken nun auch automatisierte Prozessabläufe – zumindest teilweise – Einzug in die klinische Routine gehalten. Diese Systeme nutzen verschiedenste Anwendungen der künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) und sind mehrheitlich dazu konzipiert worden, um die medizinische Bildrekonstruktion, Rauschunterdrückung, Qualitätssicherung, Triage, Segmentierung, computergestützte Erkennung und Klassifizierung oder Radiogenomics als neuartiges Forschungsfeld zu optimieren. Die von der KI übernommenen Aufgaben werden dabei deutlich schneller und präziser erledigt, was sich spätestens mit den jährlichen Auswertungen der ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVCR) ab 2015 mit Fehlerraten deutlich unterhalb der von Menschen zeigt. In diesem Übersichtsartikel soll auf die potenziellen Möglichkeiten und die derzeitig verfügbaren Anwendungen der KI in der gynäkologisch-geburtshilflichen Diagnostik eingegangen werden.

10.1111/all.16100,Patients' values and preferences for health states in allergic rhinitis-An artificial intelligence supported systematic review.,"BACKGROUND
Allergic rhinitis (AR) impacts patients' physical and emotional well-being. Assessing patients' values and preferences (V&P) related to AR is an essential part of patient-centered care and of the guideline development process. We aimed to systematically summarize the information about patients' V&P on AR and its symptoms and impact on daily life.


METHODS
We conducted systematic review in a MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo, and CINAHL databases. We included studies which quantitatively assessed patients' V&P for specific outcomes in AR by assessing utilities, applying discrete choice approaches, or rating and ranking outcomes. We grouped outcomes as AR symptoms, functional status, and care-related patient experience. Study selection and data extraction were supported by the Laser AI tool. We rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) using the GRADE approach.


RESULTS
Thirty-six studies (41 records) were included: nine utility studies, seven direct-choice studies and 21 studies of rating or ranking outcomes. Utilities were lower with increased AR severity and with the concomitant presence of asthma, but not with whether AR was seasonal or perennial (CoE = low-high). Patients rated AR symptom-related outcomes as more important than those related to care-related patient experience and functional status (CoE = very low-moderate). Nasal symptoms (mainly nasal congestion) followed by breathing disorders, general and ocular symptoms were rated as the symptoms with the highest impact.


CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of V&P of patients with AR. Patients generally considered nasal symptoms as the most important. Future studies with standardized methods are needed to provide more information on V&P in AR.",2024.0,2024-03-29,6,52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009bfdee63c54a704e0c6408ddfba17a0512d24e
10.1002/1878-0261.13313,Artificial intelligence‐driven consensus gene signatures for improving bladder cancer clinical outcomes identified by multi‐center integration analysis,"To accurately predict the prognosis and further improve the clinical outcomes of bladder cancer (BLCA), we leveraged large‐scale data to develop and validate a robust signature consisting of small gene sets. Ten machine‐learning algorithms were enrolled and subsequently transformed into 76 combinations, which were further performed on eight independent cohorts (n = 1218). We ultimately determined a consensus artificial intelligence‐derived gene signature (AIGS) with the best performance among 76 model types. In this model, patients with high AIGS showed a higher risk of mortality, recurrence, and disease progression. AIGS is not only independent of traditional clinical traits [(e.g., American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage)] and molecular features (e.g., TP53 mutation) but also demonstrated superior performance to these variables. Comparisons with 58 published signatures also indicated that AIGS possessed the best performance. Additionally, the combination of AIGS and AJCC stage could achieve better performance. Patients with low AIGS scores were sensitive to immunotherapy, whereas patients with high AIGS scores might benefit from seven potential therapeutics: BRD‐K45681478, 1S,3R‐RSL‐3, RITA, U‐0126, temsirolimus, MRS‐1220, and LY2784544. Additionally, some mutations (TP53 and RB1), copy number variations (7p11.2), and a methylation‐driven target were characterized by AIGS‐related multi‐omics alterations. Overall, AIGS provides an attractive platform to optimize decision‐making and surveillance protocol for individual BLCA patients.",2022.0,2022-09-09,14,52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009c41359ec45181cc95942578b39d0c35a138fe
10.1002/smm2.1005,Smart catalytic materials for energy transition,"Energy transition, and the related chemistry transition due to their strong nexus, is creating a major worldwide change in the current production system, driven initially by social and environmental pressures (cleaner production, reduced greenhouse gas emissions), but today instead is pushed by economic (renewable energy sources are becoming progressively the more economic energy form) and geopolitical (energy security) motivations. Oil and natural gases are the building blocks of the current refinery and (petro) chemistry, but going beyond fossil fuels is the challenge associated with this transition. This has also major implications on the technologies and processes actually in use, further pushed from another emerging direction associated with the progressive change from centralized to delocalized productions, for a better link with the territory and the local resources. The combined effect of these two emerging directions determines a radical change in the energy and chemical production systems, with major technological implications. Current process technologies in the area of chemical and fuel production cannot just be adapted, they need to be fully redesigned (also in terms of concepts, materials, engineering) to address the new challenges of using renewable energy sources in delocalized productions (small‐scale production at the regional level using local resources and in strong symbiosis to other local productions). Catalysis, particularly based on the use of solid catalytic materials, was one of the key enabling technologies of the current refinery and petrochemistry, with other 90% of the processes using heterogeneous catalysts and an economic impact (direct and indirect) of about one‐ third of the gross domestic product. This transition in the energy and chemistry requires thus to redesign catalysts because they need to operate under different conditions and for different targets. Rather than operations at high temperatures and sometimes also higher pressure, with heat as the main medium to provide/withdrawn energy to sustain the reaction, the use of renewable energy sources requires to change the catalytic technology, for example, using photons and/or electrons to drive the catalytic reactions, with operations typically at (or close to) ambient conditions. Thus, changing from thermal to photo/electrocatalysis requires a full rethinking of the conceptual aspects of catalyst design. This opens new possibilities for the area of smart catalytic materials. The definition of ""smart catalytic materials"" refers to those where their catalytic performances can be changed by using an external stimulus and thus may be developed a system controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) able to vary dynamically the response, based, for example, to changes in the feed or to reaching some level of deactivation. A sensor may monitor the variation and give feedback to an AI. For example, in the case of deactivation of a solid catalyst, AI may induce a self‐regeneration (in‐situ) of the catalyst by an external stimulus. Some catalysts present in nature, such as enzymes or macrocyclic complexes, possess a self‐regenerative functionality or they can self‐adapt to external responses. For example, in photosynthesis machinery, there are self‐reparation functions that limit activity when too intense light is present. However, these are not considered as ""smart catalytic systems"" because there is no possibility to control these systems by AI, and these systems are the result of evolution processes, not of any specific ad‐hoc synthesis procedures. The term ""smart catalytic materials"" thus indicates two main classes of catalysts. The first (also called intelligent catalysts) is related to those catalysts having self‐ regenerative functionalities. This is an area in which significant effort was made about 15 years ago, particularly in relation to automotive emissions control, although finding then limited commercial uses. It was related to the possibility of a cyclic movement of Palladium (Pd) between the outside (as Pd nanoparticles) and the inside (as Pd cations in the lattice) of the perovskite crystal in synchronization with the inherent fluctuations between reductive and oxidative (redox) atmospheres that occur in real automotive exhaust gases. A more recent example is the application of this concept to La‐ doped strontium titanate (LST) materials for advanced SOFC (solid oxide fuel cells) anodes where nanosized nickel catalyst is repeatedly exsolved from and incorporated back into the LST perovskite host structure, to improve durability and sulfur resistance. Figure 1 illustrates this concept.",2020.0,2020-08-25,57,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009c458f05cc97932dee1cee3cbfa00b0d641284

10.34197/ats-scholar.2022-0118LE,Discourage Paint-by-Numbers Presentations,"To the Editor: We read with interest the recent article by King and colleagues on the use of natural language processing (NLP) as an assessment tool for oral patient presentations (1). Although the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has greatly impacted medicine, no tool is better than the application asked of it. Careful deliberation is needed to understand the potential risks to the learning environment of applying NLP to oral presentations. Oral presentations simultaneously serve a number of rhetorical roles: establishing shared knowledge for decision making, an opportunity to practice integrative clinical reasoning, and case-based review of evidence-based medicine. The relative importance of these purposes shifts with the contextual listening audience and other context. It is unclear to us how using a small collection of model presentations could capture this dynamism. Furthermore, evidence demonstrates learners’ persistent tendency to overlook these multiple objectives in pursuit of the singular goal of demonstrating mastery to their assessor (2). Would this tendency be increased or decreased by the presence of a scoring rubric that assessed only for similarity to a static, gold-standard presentation? There is potentially broad disservice to the educational goals of patient presentation. One major weakness consistently identified in instructor feedback is a lack of contextualization that leads students to learn the wrong lessons (3). NLP-based rubrics would preserve this quality. Although artificial intelligence can highlight how the learner’s work was different, it is silent on why the attending made different choices. Those struggling to improve are as adrift in deriving important principles from these differences as they are in more conventional feedback models. Through these patterns, the use of NLP-based feedback can encourage harmful cognitive schema, such as overconfidence. NLP-based feedback would create an artificial but academically consequential benchmark: the idea that one single form of case presentation is most correct. We are concerned about the implicit impact",2023.0,2023-03-01,0,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009d4316650695e1e31b22b6077392bf652d347b

Broadly speaking, metaverse encompasses technologies as diverse as augmented reality (AR), “lifelogging” (smart watches, smart phones and other wearables), “mirror” worlds (e.g. Google Earth, Waze, …) and virtual reality (VR). There is a pressing need to understand the potential of metaverse for medicine in general and psychiatry in particular. The therapeutic use of VR technologies is already a reality in clinical practice, particularly in terms of online treatments and exposure and response prevention for anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and trauma-related disorders. Avatar integrated therapies may increase treatment seeking via anonymity, decrease in physical and communication barriers, and facilitation of expression.

10.47611/jsrhs.v13i1.5928,AI-assisted teaching as a method for enhancing ballet instruction for people with disabilities and older adults.,"In ballet, students have historically relied on teachers providing them with feedback after executing a combination – a method of teaching that has changed little over the years. Students, especially those with disabilities and older adults, may not receive as much attention or feedback as other students, or may not have the opportunity to practice ballet at all. We argue that this opportunity gap, along with other creative challenges in teaching, may be addressed with artificial intelligence (AI). This paper synthesizes research on the potential for AI to be integrated into ballet teaching, highlighting how it may benefit dancers with different skill levels and access needs, such as people with disabilities and older adults. We discuss how AI may be beneficial in providing personalized feedback, creating choreography, preventing injuries, helping students learn choreography, improving remote ballet classes, and helping teachers generate combinations for class. Importantly, however, AI should not fully replace dance teachers, and engineers should ensure that the AI is trained to support a diverse group of dancers. ",2024.0,2024-02-28,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a5ea256af6c987ab87646bbeef768c4c8ce4fc
10.3390/cancers15205063,AI Deployment on GBM Diagnosis: A Novel Approach to Analyze Histopathological Images Using Image Feature-Based Analysis,"Simple Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common malignant primary brain tumors. The gold standard of cancer diagnosis relies on a medical technologist and a pathologist for feature-based analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. To improve the efficiency of GBM diagnosis, an artificial intelligence model was built based on the TCGA-GBM dataset, and was deployed on an independent dataset collected locally. The support vector machine model showed excellent accuracy with very good sensitivity and specificity. It could potentially be used for GBM diagnosis and future clinical application. Abstract Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common malignant primary brain tumors, which accounts for 60–70% of all gliomas. Conventional diagnosis and the decision of post-operation treatment plan for glioblastoma is mainly based on the feature-based qualitative analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) histopathological slides by both an experienced medical technologist and a pathologist. The recent development of digital whole slide scanners makes AI-based histopathological image analysis feasible and helps to diagnose cancer by accurately counting cell types and/or quantitative analysis. However, the technology available for digital slide image analysis is still very limited. This study aimed to build an image feature-based computer model using histopathology whole slide images to differentiate patients with glioblastoma (GBM) from healthy control (HC). Method: Two independent cohorts of patients were used. The first cohort was composed of 262 GBM patients of the Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiform Collection (TCGA-GBM) dataset from the cancer imaging archive (TCIA) database. The second cohort was composed of 60 GBM patients collected from a local hospital. Also, a group of 60 participants with no known brain disease were collected. All the H&E slides were collected. Thirty-three image features (22 GLCM and 11 GLRLM) were retrieved from the tumor volume delineated by medical technologist on H&E slides. Five machine-learning algorithms including decision-tree (DT), extreme-boost (EB), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and linear model (LM) were used to build five models using the image features extracted from the first cohort of patients. Models built were deployed using the selected key image features for GBM diagnosis from the second cohort (local patients) as model testing, to identify and verify key image features for GBM diagnosis. Results: All five machine learning algorithms demonstrated excellent performance in GBM diagnosis and achieved an overall accuracy of 100% in the training and validation stage. A total of 12 GLCM and 3 GLRLM image features were identified and they showed a significant difference between the normal and the GBM image. However, only the SVM model maintained its excellent performance in the deployment of the models using the independent local cohort, with an accuracy of 93.5%, sensitivity of 86.95%, and specificity of 99.73%. Conclusion: In this study, we have identified 12 GLCM and 3 GLRLM image features which can aid the GBM diagnosis. Among the five models built, the SVM model proposed in this study demonstrated excellent accuracy with very good sensitivity and specificity. It could potentially be used for GBM diagnosis and future clinical application.",2023.0,2023-10-01,7,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a62b8df60f14a262861724d96b82f8538f8705
10.1117/1.JMI.10.4.044504,Predicting intensive care need for COVID-19 patients using deep learning on chest radiography,"Abstract. Purpose Image-based prediction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and resource needs can be an important means to address the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) COVID-19 prognosis method to predict patients’ needs for intensive care by analyzing chest X-ray radiography (CXR) images using deep learning. Approach The dataset consisted of 8357 CXR exams from 5046 COVID-19–positive patients as confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a training/validation/test split of 64%/16%/20% on a by patient level. Our model involved a DenseNet121 network with a sequential transfer learning technique employed to train on a sequence of gradually more specific and complex tasks: (1) fine-tuning a model pretrained on ImageNet using a previously established CXR dataset with a broad spectrum of pathologies; (2) refining on another established dataset to detect pneumonia; and (3) fine-tuning using our in-house training/validation datasets to predict patients’ needs for intensive care within 24, 48, 72, and 96 h following the CXR exams. The classification performances were evaluated on our independent test set (CXR exams of 1048 patients) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between those COVID-19–positive patients who required intensive care following the imaging exam and those who did not. Results Our proposed AI/ML model achieved an AUC (95% confidence interval) of 0.78 (0.74, 0.81) when predicting the need for intensive care 24 h in advance, and at least 0.76 (0.73, 0.80) for 48 h or more in advance using predictions based on the AI prognostic marker derived from CXR images.

Many industries prefer to use hydraulic systems due to their numerous advantages over electrical and mechanical systems. Hence, the growth in demand for hydraulic systems has been increasing over time. Due to its vast variety of applications, the faults in hydraulic systems can cause a breakdown. Using Artificial-Intelligence (AI)-based approaches, faults can be classified and predicted to avoid downtime and ensure sustainable operations. This research work proposes a novel approach for the classification of the cooling behavior of a hydraulic test rig. Three fault conditions for the cooling system of the hydraulic test rig were used. The spectrograms were generated using the time series data for three fault conditions. The CNN variant, the Residual Network, was used for the classification of the fault conditions. Various features were extracted from the data including the F-score, precision, accuracy, and recall using a Confusion Matrix. The data contained 43,680 attributes and 2205 instances.

10.1111/pbi.14533,Harnessing promoter elements to enhance gene editing in plants: perspectives and advances.,"Genome-edited plants, endowed with climate-smart traits, have been promoted as tools for strengthening resilience against climate change. Successful plant gene editing (GE) requires precise regulation of the GE machinery, a process controlled by the promoters, which drives its transcription through interactions with transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerase. While constitutive promoters are extensively used in GE constructs, their limitations highlight the need for alternative approaches. This review emphasizes the promise of tissue/organ specific as well as inducible promoters, which enable targeted GE in a spatiotemporal manner with no effects on other tissues. Advances in synthetic biology have paved the way for the creation of synthetic promoters, offering refined control over gene expression and augmenting the potential of plant GE. The integration of these novel promoters with synthetic systems presents significant opportunities for precise and conditional genome editing. Moreover, the advent of bioinformatic tools and artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the characterization of regulatory elements, enhancing our understanding of their roles in plants. Thus, this review provides novel insights into the strategic use of promoters and promoter editing to enhance the precision, efficiency and specificity of plant GE, setting the stage for innovative crop improvement strategies.",2025.0,2025-02-27,0,238,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a8f6027c4a07784f396e6ed93ce466314eb4de

10.2174/1874120701913010033,An Improved Segmentation and Classifier Approach Based on HMM for Brain Cancer Detection,"
 
 Brain tumors are fatal diseases that are spread worldwide and affect all types of age groups. Due to its direct impact on the central nervous system, if tumor cells prevail at certain locations in the brain, the overall functionality of the body is disturbed and chances of a person approaching death are high. Tumors can be cancerous or non-cancerous but in many cases, the chances of complete recovery are less and as a result death rate has increased all over the world despite recent advancements in technology, equipment and awareness. So the main concern is to detect brain related diseases at early stages so that they do not spread into vital parts of brain and disrupt body functions. Also, more precise and accurate technologies are required to serve as aid in the diagnosis, treatment and surgery of brain. 
 
 
 
 Therefore, its high alarming time to monitor mortality statistics and develop faster and accurate methods to curb the situation by simulating tissue deformation and locating cancerous nodes which is currently the prominent area of interest. 
 
 
 
 A brain tumor is used to design the deformation model. Early stage detection of tumors is difficult from images. Moreover, the accuracy involved is low. Keeping all this into consideration, a machine learning approach has been developed for classification of cancerous and non-cancerous tissues so that the tissues having risk of future problem can also be recognized. The patient’s deformation model can be designed and brain tumor patterns are given as input on the basis of which tumor in the brain is marked. The proposed method of segmentation is based on a statistical model called Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which extricates the cancerous portion out of fed input MRI image along with the calculation of parameters such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), fault rate dust detection and accuracy.
 
 
 
 The results obtained from parametric analysis show that HMM has performed better than the technique of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for brain cancer segmentation in terms of PSNR, MSE, fault rate dust detection and accuracy. So image processing is used in combination with Hidden Markov Model for classification and analysis to which MRI images are fed as input.
 
 
 
 In this way, integration of artificial intelligence techniques with image processing can serve as a good way for segmentation of tumors and for classification purposes with good accuracy.

10.4274/dir.2024.242790,A comparison of two artificial intelligence-based methods for assessing bone age in Turkish children: BoneXpert and VUNO Med-Bone Age.,"PURPOSE
This study aimed to evaluate the validity of two artificial intelligence (AI)-based bone age assessment programs, BoneXpert and VUNO Med-Bone Age (VUNO), compared with manual assessments using the Greulich-Pyle method in Turkish children.


METHODS
This study included a cohort of 292 pediatric cases, ranging in age from 1 to 15 years with an equal gender and number distribution in each age group. Two radiologists, who were unaware of the bone age determined by AI, independently evaluated the bone age. The statistical study involved using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to measure the level of agreement between the manual and AI-based assessments.


RESULTS
The ICC coefficients for the agreement between the manual measurements of two radiologists indicate almost perfect agreement. When all cases, regardless of gender and age group, were analyzed, a nearly perfect positive agreement was observed between the manual and software measurements. When bone age calculations were separated and analyzed separately for girls and boys, there was no statistically significant difference between the two AI-based methods for boys; however, ICC coefficients of 0.990 and 0.982 were calculated for VUNO and BoneXpert, respectively, and this difference of 0.008 was significant (z = 2.528, P = 0.012) for girls. Accordingly, VUNO showed higher agreement with manual measurements compared with BoneXpert. The difference between the agreements demonstrated by the two software packages with manual measurements in the prepubescent group was much more pronounced in girls compared with boys. After the age of 8 years for girls and 9 years for boys, the agreement between manual measurements and both AI software packages was equal.


CONCLUSION
Both BoneXpert and VUNO showed high validity in assessing bone age. Furthermore, VUNO has a statistically higher correlation with manual assessment in prepubertal girls. These results suggest that VUNO may be slightly more effective in determining bone age, indicating its potential as a highly reliable tool for bone age assessment in Turkish children.

The interaction of its cellular components plays a crucial role in tumor development and progression, contributing to the alteration of metabolism and cellular hyperproliferation, as well as to metastatic evolution and abnormal tumor-associated immunity. Furthermore, in response to intrinsic oncogenic alterations and the influence of the tumor microenvironment, cancer cells undergo a complex oncogene-directed metabolic reprogramming that includes changes in glucose utilization, lipid and amino acid metabolism, redox balance, and activation of recycling and scavenging pathways. The advent of omics sciences is revolutionizing the comprehension of the pathogenetic conundrum of pancreatic carcinogenesis. In particular, metabolomics and genomics has led to a more precise classification of PC into subtypes that show different biological behaviors and responses to treatments. The identification of molecular targets through the pharmacogenomic approach may help to personalize treatments. Novel specific biomarkers have been discovered using proteomics and metabolomics analyses. Radiomics allows for an earlier diagnosis through the computational analysis of imaging. However, the complexity, high expertise required, and costs of the omics approach are the main limitations for its use in clinical practice at present. In addition, the studies of extracellular vesicles (EVs), the use of organoids, the understanding of host–microbiota interactions, and more recently the advent of artificial intelligence are helping to make further steps towards precision and personalized medicine. This present review summarizes the main evidence for the application of omics sciences to the study of PC and the identification of future perspectives.",2024.0,2024-07-01,2,145,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00aacd86d95a03369f649646d09d92df9ff80e29

10.3390/s24113608,Multi-Branch Network for Color Image Denoising Using Dilated Convolution and Attention Mechanisms,"Image denoising is regarded as an ill-posed problem in computer vision tasks that removes additive noise from imaging sensors. Recently, several convolution neural network-based image-denoising methods have achieved remarkable advances. However, it is difficult for a simple denoising network to recover aesthetically pleasing images owing to the complexity of image content. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch network to improve the performance of the denoising method. First, the proposed network is designed based on a conventional autoencoder to learn multi-level contextual features from input images. Subsequently, we integrate two modules into the network, including the Pyramid Context Module (PCM) and the Residual Bottleneck Attention Module (RBAM), to extract salient information for the training process. More specifically, PCM is applied at the beginning of the network to enlarge the receptive field and successfully address the loss of global information using dilated convolution. Meanwhile, RBAM is inserted into the middle of the encoder and decoder to eliminate degraded features and reduce undesired artifacts. Finally, extensive experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art deep-learning methods in terms of objective and subjective performances.",2024.0,2024-06-01,6,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001caa75d4244aa916ea99b361afe9e6466c55b

10.3390/app14167140,Multiplatform Computer Vision System to Support Physical Fitness Assessments in Schoolchildren,"Currently, the lack of physical activity can lead to health problems, with the increase in obesity in children between 8 and 18 years old being of particular interest because it is a formative stage. One of the aspects of trying to solve this problem is the need for a standardized, less subjective, and more efficient method of evaluating physical condition in these children compared to traditional approaches. Objective: Develop a multiplatform based on computer vision technology that allows the evaluation of the physical fitness of schoolchildren using smartphones. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on schoolchildren aged 8 to 18 years of both sexes. The sample was 228 schoolchildren (128 boys and 108 girls). Anthropometric measurements of weight, height, and waist circumference were evaluated. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Four physical tests were evaluated: flexibility (sit and reach), horizontal jump (explosive strength), biceps curl (right arm strength resistance), and sit-ups (abdominal muscle resistance). With the information collected traditionally and by filming the physical tests, a computer vision system was developed to evaluate physical fitness in schoolchildren. Results: The implemented system obtained an acceptable level of precision, reaching 94% precision in field evaluations and a percentage greater than 95% in laboratory evaluations for testing. The developed mobile application also obtained a high accuracy percentage, greater than 95% in two tests and close to 85% in the remaining two. Finally, the Systematic Software Quality Model was used to determine user satisfaction with the presented prototype. Regarding usability, a satisfaction level of 97% and a reliability level of 100% was obtained. Conclusion: Compared to traditional evaluation and computer vision, the proposal was satisfactorily validated. These results were obtained using the Expanded Systematic Software Quality Model, which reached an “advanced” quality level, satisfying functionality, usability, and reliability characteristics. This advance demonstrates that the integration of computer vision is feasible, highly effective in the educational context, and applicable in the evaluations of physical education classes.",2024.0,2024-08-14,0,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0006cd96e0079e8cd6497e919ece9dbebae9f662

Despite growing interest in the topic, a comprehensive review of research about smart environments from the architectural perspective is largely missing. In order to provide a formal understanding of smart environments in architecture, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of scholarly sources over the last decade, focusing on four related subjects: (1) responsive architecture, (2) kinetic architecture, (3) adaptive architecture and (4) intelligent buildings. Through this review, the paper identifies and examines interactive and collective behaviors in smart environments, thereby contributing to defining the properties of creative, smart spaces in the contemporary digital ecosystem. In addition, this research offers a means of systematically characterizing and constructing smart environments as interactive and collective platforms, enabling occupants to sense, experience and understand smart spaces.",2021.0,2021-05-01,15,158,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c5df8acf814794e2643c1359f2277c4edaefa

10.3390/app122211414,A Novel Filter-Level Deep Convolutional Neural Network Pruning Method Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in the field of computer vision. The high requirements for memory and storage by DNNs make it difficult to apply them to mobile or embedded devices. Therefore, compression and structure optimization of deep neural networks have become a hot research topic. To eliminate redundant structures in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), we propose an efficient filter pruning framework via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed framework is based on a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for filter pruning rate optimization. The main features of the proposed framework are as follows: (1) AA tailored reward function considering both accuracy and complexity of DCNN is proposed for the training of DDPG and (2) a novel filter sorting criterion based on Taylor expansion is developed for filter pruning selection. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, extensive comparative studies on large public datasets and well-recognized DCNNs are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the Taylor-expansion-based filter sorting criterion is much better than the widely used minimum-weight-based criterion. More importantly, the proposed filter pruning framework can achieve over 10× parameter compression and 3× floating point operations (FLOPs) reduction while maintaining similar accuracy to the original network. The performance of the proposed framework is promising compared with state-of-the-art DRL-based filter pruning methods.",2022.0,2022-11-10,3,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001258fe0ecc32170d38597e7ff9f2ee60562692

10.3390/photonics6040114,Pupil Function in Pseudophakia: Proximal Miosis Behavior and Optical Influence,"The pseudophakic eye lacks the ability to produce a refractive change in response to object proximity. Thus, individual anatomical features such as the pupil size play an important role in achieving functional vision levels. In this work, the range of pupil sizes at varying object distance was measured in pseudophakic participants. Furthermore, the impact of the measured values on eye optical quality was investigated using a computer simulation model. A binocular eye-tracker was used to measure the participants’ pupil sizes at six object distances, ranging from 0.33 m (i.e., vergence of 3.00 D) to 3.00 m (i.e., vergence of 0.33 D), while observing a Maltese cross with a constant angular size of 1 ∘ . In total, 58 pseudophakic participants were enrolled in this study (age mean ± standard deviation: 70.5 ± 11.3 years). The effects of object distance and age on pupil size variation were investigated using linear mixed effects regression models. Age was found to have a small contribution to individual variability. The mean infinite distance pupil size (intercept) was 4.45 ( 95 % CI: 2.74, 6.17) mm and the mean proximal miosis (slope) was − 0.23 ( 95 % CI: −0.53, 0.08) mm/D. The visual acuity (VA) estimation for a distant object ranged from − 0.1 logMAR (smallest pupil) to 0.04 logMAR (largest pupil) and the near VA ( 0.33 m) when mean proximal miosis was considered ranged from 0.28 logMAR (smallest pupil) to 0.42 logMAR (largest pupil). When mean distance pupil was considered, proximal miosis individual variability produced a variation of 0.04 logMAR for the near object and negligible variation for the distant object. These results support the importance of distance pupil size measurement for the prediction of visual performance in pseudophakia, while suggesting that proximal miosis has a negligible impact in VA variability.",2019.0,2019-11-06,3,62,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0043495a4f801d84db77995b9ddc8994e672d271

In a certain video, it seeks to rapidly and precisely detect and locate a huge amount of the objects according to redetermined categories. The two forms of deep learning (DL) algorithms that are used in the model training algorithm are single-stage and 2-stage algorithms of detection. The representative algorithms for every level have been thoroughly discussed in this work. The analysis and comparison of numerous representative algorithms in this subject is after that explained. Last but not least, potential obstacles to target detection are anticipated.

10.1109/JIOT.2022.3215188,Attention-Based Adversarial Robust Distillation in Radio Signal Classifications for Low-Power IoT Devices,"Due to great success of transformers in many applications, such as natural language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or operation of devices in an environment where power supply is limited, we propose a compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks. The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box scenarios, including the fast gradient method and projected gradient descent attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer from the transferability of adversarial examples.",2023.0,2023-02-01,6,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c9fed2512b9cadce82a60c19668289e7148cc

10.5194/ISPRS-ARCHIVES-XLII-2-593-2018,EVALUATION OF DEEP LEARNING BASED STEREO MATCHING METHODS: FROM GROUND TO AERIAL IMAGES,"Abstract. Dense stereo matching has been extensively studied in photogrammetry and computer vision. In this paper we evaluate the application of deep learning based stereo methods, which were raised from 2016 and rapidly spread, on aerial stereos other than ground images that are commonly used in computer vision community. Two popular methods are evaluated. One learns matching cost with a convolutional neural network (known as MC-CNN); the other produces a disparity map in an end-to-end manner by utilizing both geometry and context (known as GC-net). First, we evaluate the performance of the deep learning based methods for aerial stereo images by a direct model reuse. The models pre-trained on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and Driving datasets separately, are directly applied to three aerial datasets. We also give the results of direct training on target aerial datasets. Second, the deep learning based methods are compared to the classic stereo matching method, Semi-Global Matching(SGM), and a photogrammetric software, SURE, on the same aerial datasets. Third, transfer learning strategy is introduced to aerial image matching based on the assumption of a few target samples available for model fine tuning. It experimentally proved that the conventional methods and the deep learning based methods performed similarly, and the latter had greater potential to be explored.

10.21275/sr211102183259,Smart Parking with Prediction of Available Spots: A Proposed Approach,": Parking is the most common and can be an extremely inconvenient thing in our day - to - day life. Every citizen faces this problem at least one time a day. In crowded megacities such as New York, LA, Washington D. C., people face excessive difficulty in finding the right place to park. Because of so much population of the vehicles in the city, there is not much space available for park and also might not enough obtainable space at your preferred destination. In megacities, there is no satisfactory parking space management system available in addition parking cost is outrageous. In this paper, a solution is proposed for the prediction of parking spots and parking spot management with the security of the parking area. Computer vision is the main solution that works on an open - source algorithm to sense the car at the defined space in the parking area. Computer vision might be handier on other solutions too such as parking monitoring, vehicle security, accident avoidance, and parking cost management. A brief discussion over the topic is charted in this document.",2021.0,2021-11-27,0,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005171b3954f04a5ca727a49ac6268c42456794b

Fruit Recognition has been gaining attraction in recent years due to its application in agriculture and food industry. In this project, we propose a multi-fruit classification scheme based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network and we aim to build a Deep Neural Network to correctly identify the fruits and classify them according to their quality that is- into fresh and rotten. A fruit recognition process usually comprises of three steps: 1. Image acquisition 2. Pre-processing 3. Image analysis.

10.1101/2024.05.27.596053,Brain representation in conscious and unconscious vision,"The development of robust frameworks to understand how the human brain represents conscious and unconscious perceptual contents is paramount to make progress in the neuroscience of consciousness. Recent functional MRI studies using multi-voxel pattern classification analyses showed that unconscious contents could be decoded from brain activity patterns. However, decoding does not imply a full understanding of neural representations. Here we re-analysed data from a high-precision fMRI study coupled with representational similarity analysis based on convolutional neural network models to provide a detailed information-based approach to neural representations of both unconscious and conscious perceptual content. The results showed that computer vision model representations strongly predicted brain responses in ventral visual cortex and in fronto-parietal regions to both conscious and unconscious contents. Moreover, this pattern of results generalised when the models were trained and tested with different participants. Remarkably, these observations results held even when the analysis was restricted to observers that showed null perceptual sensitivity. In light of the highly distributed brain representation of unconscious information, we suggest that the functional role of fronto-parietal cortex in conscious perception is unlikely to be related to the broadcasting of information, as proposed by the global neuronal workspace theory, and may instead relate to the generation of meta-representations as proposed by higher-order theories.",2024.0,2024-06-01,0,66,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0054ca0f4c106fc00d35b999be234397ffc7b8ea
10.3390/fi14110319,IoT-Based System for Improving Vehicular Safety by Continuous Traffic Violation Monitoring,"The violation traffic laws by driving at high speeds, the overloading of passengers, and the unfastening of seatbelts are of high risk and can be fatal in the event of any accident. Several systems have been proposed to improve passenger safety, and the systems either use the sensor-based approach or the computer-vision-based approach. However, the accuracy of these systems still needs enhancement because the entire road network is not covered; the approaches utilize complex estimation techniques, and they are significantly influenced by the surrounding environment, such as the weather and physical obstacles. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel IoT-based traffic violation monitoring system that accurately estimates the vehicle speed, counts the number of passengers, and detects the seatbelt status on the entire road network. The system also utilizes edge computing, fog computing, and cloud computing technologies to achieve high accuracy. The system is evaluated using real-life experiments and compared with another system where the edge and cloud layers are used without the fog layer. The results show that adding a fog layer improves the monitoring accuracy as the accuracy of passenger counting rises from 94% to 97%, the accuracy of seatbelt detection rises from 95% to 99%, and the root mean square error of speed estimation is reduced from 2.64 to 1.87.",2022.0,2022-11-02,5,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00563bb9c48a7e5b8328f45eb0c8bf63edc66276

10.3390/agriculture13030574,Machine Learning Techniques for Estimating Soil Moisture from Smartphone Captured Images,"Precise Soil Moisture (SM) assessment is essential in agriculture. By understanding the level of SM, we can improve yield irrigation scheduling which significantly impacts food production and other needs of the global population. The advancements in smartphone technologies and computer vision have demonstrated a non-destructive nature of soil properties, including SM. The study aims to analyze the existing Machine Learning (ML) techniques for estimating SM from soil images and understand the moisture accuracy using different smartphones and various sunlight conditions. Therefore, 629 images of 38 soil samples were taken from seven areas in Sydney, Australia, and split into four datasets based on the image-capturing devices used (iPhone 6s and iPhone 11 Pro) and the lighting circumstances (direct and indirect sunlight). A comparison between Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was presented. MLR was performed with higher accuracy using holdout cross-validation, where the images were captured in indirect sunlight with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value of 0.35, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 0.15, and R2 value of 0.60. Nevertheless, SVR was better with MAE, RMSE, and R2 values of 0.05, 0.06, and 0.96 for 10-fold cross-validation and 0.22, 0.06, and 0.95 for leave-one-out cross-validation when images were captured in indirect sunlight. It demonstrates a smartphone camera’s potential for predicting SM by utilizing ML. In the future, software developers can develop mobile applications based on the research findings for accurate, easy, and rapid SM estimation.",2023.0,2023-02-27,19,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005880e5ec9d3077b03d63d4d8a1ea0e8f3d1476

10.3390/rs11202380,DE-Net: Deep Encoding Network for Building Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery,"Deep convolutional neural networks have promoted significant progress in building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Although most of such work focuses on modifying existing image segmentation networks in computer vision, we propose a new network in this paper, Deep Encoding Network (DE-Net), that is designed for the very problem based on many lately introduced techniques in image segmentation. Four modules are used to construct DE-Net: the inceptionstyle downsampling modules combining a striding convolution layer and a max-pooling layer, the encoding modules comprising six linear residual blocks with a scaled exponential linear unit (SELU) activation function, the compressing modules reducing the feature channels, and a densely upsampling module that enables the network to encode spatial information inside feature maps. Thus, DE-Net achieves stateoftheart performance on the WHU Building Dataset in recall, F1-Score, and intersection over union (IoU) metrics without pretraining. It also outperformed several segmentation networks in our self-built Suzhou Satellite Building Dataset. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of DE-Net on building extraction from aerial imagery and satellite imagery. It also suggests that given enough training data, designing and training a network from scratch may excel fine-tuning models pre-trained on datasets unrelated to building extraction.",2019.0,2019-10-14,57,58,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006176244e7819623a3753b2e709f19ce7b8dff5
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2995788,Deep Learning Based Person Authentication Using Hand Radiographs: A Forensic Approach,"Biometric radiographs have gained importance in recent times owing to the rise in crime and disaster incidents. In recent times, authentication and identification of a person has become an essential part of most of the computer vision automation systems. Conventional fingerprint, iris, face, palm prints fail to recognize the human when the external biometric parts have been damaged due to rashes, wounds, and severe burning. Security, robustness, privacy, and non-forgery are the critical aspects of any person authentication system. In such situations, identification based on radiographs of the skull, hand, and teeth are effective replacement methods. In this paper, a novel forensic hand radiograph based human authentication is proposed using a deep neural network. Three-layered convolutional deep neural network architecture is used for the feature extraction of hand radiographs and for recognition; KNN and SVM classifiers are used. As a part of the experimentation, a total of 750 hand radiographs acquired from 150 subjects of different age groups, professions, and gender are considered. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on cross-validation accuracy by varying striding pixels, polling window size, kernel size, and the number of filters. Our experiment reveals that hand radiographs contain biometric information that can be used to identify humans in disaster victim identification. The experimental study also indicates that the proposed approach is significantly effective than conventional methods for the person authentication using hand radiographs.",2020.0,,16,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006229de3bc0d2176e735e77056282ff34cef926

10.3390/app12189397,Internet of Things Meets Computer Vision to Make an Intelligent Pest Monitoring Network,"With the increase of smart farming in the agricultural sector, farmers have better control over the entire production cycle, notably in terms of pest monitoring. In fact, pest monitoring has gained significant importance, since the excessive use of pesticides can lead to great damage to crops, substantial environmental impact, and unnecessary costs both in material and manpower. Despite the potential of new technologies, pest monitoring is still done in a traditional way, leading to excessive costs, lack of precision, and excessive use of human labour. In this paper, we present an Internet of Things (IoT) network combined with intelligent Computer Vision (CV) techniques to improve pest monitoring. First, we propose to use low-cost cameras at the edge that capture images of pest traps and send them to the cloud. Second, we use deep neural models, notably R-CNN and YOLO models, to detect the Whitefly (WF) pest in yellow sticky traps. Finally, the predicted number of WF is analysed over time and results are accessible to farmers through a mobile app that allows them to visualise the pest in each specific field. The contribution is to make pest monitoring autonomous, cheaper, data-driven, and precise. Results demonstrate that, by combining IoT, CV technology, and deep models, it is possible to enhance pest monitoring.",2022.0,2022-09-19,10,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0063f2cb45e7a6e7cb6f319ad61e573a498d0e06

In this paper, we further investigate the implications of the role of additive shortcut connections, focusing on models such as ResNet, Vision Transformers (ViTs), and MLP-Mixers, given that they are essential in enabling efficient information flow and mitigating optimization challenges such as vanishing gradients. In particular, capitalizing on our recent information bottleneck approach, we analyze how additive shortcuts influence the fitting and compression phases of training, crucial for generalization. We leverage Z-X and Z-Y measures as practical alternatives to mutual information for observing these dynamics in high-dimensional spaces. Our empirical results demonstrate that models with identity shortcuts (ISs) often skip the initial fitting phase and move directly into the compression phase, while non-identity shortcut (NIS) models follow the conventional two-phase process. Furthermore, we explore how IS models are still able to compress effectively, maintaining their generalization capacity despite bypassing the early fitting stages. These findings offer new insights into the dynamics of shortcut connections in neural networks, contributing to the optimization of modern deep learning architectures.",2024.0,2024-11-01,0,52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00799fc143c0216257df3995e69b4bbff3fbafc9

10.37396/jsc.v7i2.416,Streamlined A* for Faster Robotic Inspections in Ports,"Research on automatic port inspections using robots has been carried out in the state-owned company Indonesia Port Corporation, Semarang, Indonesia. However, increasing the efficiency of robotic inspections is critical because robots need to perform these tasks at much higher speeds than humans, while maintaining a high level of accuracy. The robot is equipped with sensors and computer vision technology to detect defects or problems that humans might miss. The aim is to increase overall inspection accuracy at a lower cost. In this research, we introduce an optimized A* path planning algorithm that incorporates the flood algorithm, node reductions process, and linear path planning optimization for an autonomous navigated port inspection robot. Our primary objective is to significantly increase the efficiency of the conventional A* algorithm in guiding robotic systems through complex paths. The proposed algorithm demonstrates exceptional efficiency in generating feasible paths, with success attributed to optimization steps that specifically target reducing node processing and enhancing route finding. The experimentation phase involves a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm using six key parameters: running time, number of nodes, number of turns, maximum turning angle, expansion nodes, and the total distances output. Through rigorous testing, the algorithm's performance is evaluated and compared against seven other current algorithms, namely A*, BestFirst, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, Bidirectional A*, and Geometric A*. Results from the experiments reveal the algorithm's outstanding running time efficiency, surpassing all other algorithms tested. Notably, it exhibits a remarkable 6.5% improvement over the widely recognized Geometric A* algorithm.",2024.0,2024-08-27,0,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0083ee001a01f6fa5386d5bdd95f8ee558f32125

10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3417442,Conditional-GAN-Based Face Inpainting Approaches With Symmetry and View-Degree Utilization,"Recently, image inpainting has been proposed as a solution for restoring the polluted image in the field of computer vision. Further, face inpainting is a subfield of image inpainting, which refers to a set of image editing algorithms re-conducting the missing regions in face smoothly. Actually, face inpainting is more challenging than general image inpainting because it needs more face structure information. Although a number of past studies were proposed for face inpainting by using face segmentation, face edge and face topology, there is some important information ignored, such as geometric and symmetric properties. Based on such concepts, in this paper, we propose a two-stage face inpainting method called CGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) which integrates face landmarks and Generative Adversarial Network (called GAN). In the first stage, the face landmark is predicted as the condition, providing GAN with important information of geometry and symmetry. The main idea in this stage is to dynamically adjust the loss by the proposed view degree. Accordingly, the masked face image and the corresponding face landmark are used as conditions input to the GAN in the second stage. Finally, the missing-regions are inpainted by the proposed CGAN. To reveal the effectiveness of proposed method, a number of evaluations were conducted on real datasets. The experimental results show that, the proposed method predicts a better face landmark by information of geometric structures and symmetric outlooks, and thereupon the proposed CGAN reconstructs the missing regions superior to the compared methods.",2024.0,,1,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0084eb3b3ca30ce8103fb7133f6d44c21bff9262
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3216291,A Survey on Efficient Methods for Adversarial Robustness,"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision with phenomenal success and widespread applications. Despite impressive results in complex problems, neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks: small and imperceptible changes in input space that lead these models to incorrect outputs. Adversarial attacks have raised serious concerns, and robustness to these attacks has become a vital issue. Adversarial training, a min-max optimization approach, has shown promise against these attacks. The computational cost of adversarial training, however, makes it prohibitively difficult to scale as well as to be useful in practice. Recently, several works have explored different approaches to make adversarial training computationally more affordable. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on efficient adversarial robustness methods with an aim to present a holistic outlook to make future exploration more systematic and exhaustive. We start by mathematically defining fundamental ideas in adversarially robust learning. We then divide these approaches into two categories based on underlying mechanisms: methods that modify initial adversarial training and techniques that leverage transfer learning to improve efficiency. Finally, based on this overview, we analyze and present an outlook of future directions.",2022.0,,19,102,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00854b5fb2b36f9d638128e5dfae39d1470ad017

10.1167/iovs.61.8.10,Increased Equivalent Input Noise in Glaucomatous Central Vision: Is it Due to Undersampling of Retinal Ganglion Cells?,"Purpose Recent evidence shows that macular damage is common even in early stages of glaucoma. Here we investigated whether contrast sensitivity loss in the central vision of glaucoma patients is due to an increase in equivalent input noise (Neq), a decrease in calculation efficiency, or both. We also examined how retinal undersampling resulting from loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) may affect Neq and calculation efficiency. Methods This study included 21 glaucoma patients and 23 age-matched normally sighted individuals. Threshold contrast for orientation discrimination was measured with a sinewave grating embedded in varying levels of external noise. Data were fitted to the linear amplifier model (LAM) to factor contrast sensitivity into Neq and calculation efficiency. We also correlated macular RGC counts estimated from structural (spectral-domain optical coherence tomography) and functional (standard automated perimetry Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm 10-2) data with either Neq or efficiency. Furthermore, using analytical and computer simulation approach, the relative effect of retinal undersampling on Neq and efficiency was evaluated by adding the RGC sampling module into the LAM. Results Compared with normal controls, glaucoma patients exhibited a significantly larger Neq without significant difference in efficiency. Neq was significantly correlated with Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity and macular RGC counts. The results from analytical derivation and model simulation further demonstrated that Neq can be expressed as a function of internal noise and retinal sampling. Conclusions Our results showed that equivalent input noise is significantly elevated in glaucomatous vision, thereby impairing foveal contrast sensitivity. Our findings further elucidated how undersampling at the retinal level may increase equivalent input noise.",2020.0,2020-07-01,7,111,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0087ca7a589d7efc73286bacaf42f48e2be21eb2

Over the years, deep learning has showcased remarkable success in diverse computer vision tasks, including sentiment classification. This paper introduces a novel multi-view deep learning framework for emotion recognition from visual data. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) this framework extracts features from visual data to enhance sentiment classification accuracy. Additionally, we enhance the deep learning model through cutting-edge techniques like transfer learning to bolster its generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we develop an efficient deep learning classification algorithm, effectively categorizing visual sentiments based on the extracted features. To assess its performance, we compare our proposed model with state-of-the-art machine learning methods in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and processing speed. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of our framework, showcasing higher classification accuracy, faster training times, and improved processing speed compared to existing methods.

10.3390/f14020218,Research on 3D Phenotypic Reconstruction and Micro-Defect Detection of Green Plum Based on Multi-View Images,"Rain spots on green plum are superficial micro-defects. Defect detection based on a two-dimensional image is easily influenced by factors such as placement position and light and is prone to misjudgment and omission, which are the main problems affecting the accuracy of defect screening of green plum. In this paper, using computer vision technology, an improved structure from motion (SFM) and patch-based multi-view stereo (PMVS) algorithm based on similar graph clustering and graph matching is proposed to perform three-dimensional sparse and dense reconstruction of green plums. The results show that, compared with the traditional algorithm, the running time of this algorithm is lower, at only 26.55 s, and the mean values of camera optical center error and pose error are 0.019 and 0.631, respectively. This method obtains a higher reconstruction accuracy to meet the subsequent plum micro-defect detection requirements. Aiming at the dense point cloud model of green plums, through point cloud preprocessing, the improved adaptive segmentation algorithm based on the Lab color space realizes the effective segmentation of the point cloud of green plum micro-defects. The experimental results show that the average running time of the improved adaptive segmentation algorithm is 2.56 s, showing a faster segmentation speed and better effect than the traditional K-means and K-means++ algorithms. After clustering the micro-defect point cloud, the micro-defect information of green plums was extracted on the basis of random sample consensus (RANSAC) plane fitting, which provides a theoretical model for further improving the accuracy of sorting the appearance quality of green plums.",2023.0,2023-01-23,8,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008b1ff7e30937670cb2fef74ad895f8b749481b
10.15673/atbp.v15i4.2714,AN INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUE FOR CLASSIFICATION AND DETECTION OF SKIN CANCER USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND SVM ALGORITHM,"Skin cancer is a serious health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. One in every three cancers is a skin cancer and, most people fail to identify and get a diagnosis which is why early detection is essential for effective treatment and improving patient outcomes. In recent years, computer vision and machine learning have become important tools for the automatic detection of skin cancer. One of the commonly used machine learning algorithms for this task is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs are a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks. In skin cancer detection, the SVM classifier is trained on a dataset of dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. The first step in the process is feature extraction, where relevant information is extracted from the images to serve as input to the SVM classifier. This information can include color, texture, and shape features, among others. 
The training and testing of the SVM classifier is then performed using a portion of the dataset, with the remainder being used to evaluate its performance. During the testing phase, the SVM classifier is used to predict the class label of each image, which can be malignant or benign. The accuracy of the classifier is evaluated by comparing its predictions to the actual class labels of the images in the evaluation dataset. 
The results of using SVMs in skin cancer detection have been promising, with high accuracy rates being achieved. This highlights the potential of SVMs as a useful tool for skin cancer screening and early detection. In conclusion, the use of SVMs in skin cancer detection provides a fast, automatic, and reliable method for detecting skin cancer, which can help to improve patient outcomes. Currently it is really very important to watch and analyse the cancer disease automatically at intervals the first stages. Irregular streaks square measure one in every of the foremost very important features (included in most of dermoscopy algorithms) that show high association with carcinoma and basal cell malignant growth malady. The diagnostic test technique for the detection is most painful and harmful so we have a tendency to tend to square measure going for the machine-driven detection. Here we have a tendency to tend to square measure practice the GLCM choices for the detection the choices of skin lesions square measure extracted normalized symmetrical grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices GLCM. GLCM based texture choices square measure extracted from each of the four classes and given as input to the Multi-Class Support vector machine that's utilized for classification purpose.",2024.0,2024-01-04,0,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008b7cbaaf4881d67ff49ba7246b8dd7291722bc

Monitoring physical exercise is essential in the process of planning, applying, and controlling loads for performance optimization and health. A lot of research studies applied various statistical approaches to estimate various physiological indices, to our knowledge, no studies found to investigate the relationship of facial color changes and increased exercise intensity. The aim of this study was to develop a non-contact method based on computer vision to determine the heart rate and, ultimately, the exercise intensity. The method was based on analyzing facial color changes during exercise by using RGB, HSV, YCbCr, Lab, and YUV color models. Nine university students participated in the study (mean age = 26.88 ± 6.01 years, mean weight = 72.56 ± 14.27 kg, mean height = 172.88 ± 12.04 cm, six males and three females, and all white Caucasian).

10.21917/ijivp.2023.0448,MACHINE LEARNING-BASED FACIAL RECOGNITION FOR VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS,"Video surveillance systems play a crucial role in ensuring public safety and security. However, the traditional methods of surveillance often fall short in effectively identifying individuals, particularly in crowded or dynamic environments. This research addresses the limitations of conventional video surveillance by proposing a machine learning-based facial recognition system. The increasing demand for robust security measures necessitates the development of advanced technologies in video surveillance. Facial recognition has emerged as a promising solution, but existing systems struggle with accuracy and efficiency. This research aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging machine learning techniques for facial recognition in video surveillance. Conventional video surveillance struggles with accurate and rapid identification of individuals, leading to potential security lapses. This research addresses the challenge of enhancing facial recognition accuracy in real-time video feeds, especially in scenarios with varying lighting conditions and occlusions. While facial recognition has gained traction, there is a significant research gap in the implementation of machine learning algorithms tailored for video surveillance. This study aims to fill this void by proposing a novel methodology that combines deep learning and computer vision techniques for robust facial recognition in dynamic environments. The proposed methodology involves training a deep neural network on a diverse dataset of facial images to enable the model to learn intricate facial features. Additionally, computer vision algorithms will be employed to handle challenges such as occlusions and varying lighting conditions. The model''''s performance will be evaluated using real-world video surveillance data. Preliminary results demonstrate a significant improvement in facial recognition accuracy compared to traditional methods. The machine learning-based system exhibits enhanced performance in challenging scenarios, showcasing its potential for practical implementation in video surveillance systems.",2023.0,2023-11-01,2,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a7779315069f9afe8b1bba1da82cc77415b11d
10.3390/s21227543,A Review of Deep Learning-Based Methods for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction is one of the main concerns of computer vision problems in the automotive industry, especially in the field of advanced driver assistance systems. The ability to anticipate the next movements of pedestrians on the street is a key task in many areas, e.g., self-driving auto vehicles, mobile robots or advanced surveillance systems, and they still represent a technological challenge. The performance of state-of-the-art pedestrian trajectory prediction methods currently benefits from the advancements in sensors and associated signal processing technologies. The current paper reviews the most recent deep learning-based solutions for the problem of pedestrian trajectory prediction along with employed sensors and afferent processing methodologies, and it performs an overview of the available datasets, performance metrics used in the evaluation process, and practical applications. Finally, the current work exposes the research gaps from the literature and outlines potential new research directions.",2021.0,2021-11-01,55,129,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a7ce1a0829fb46fb083f7a6916b54e91ff0f3e

10.26555/IJAIN.V5I1.327,Fast and stable direct relative orientation of UAV-based stereo pair,"Coplanarity-based relative orientation (RO) is one of the most crucial processes to obtain reliable 3D model and point clouds in Computer Vision and Photogrammetry community. Whilst a classical and rigorous procedure requires very close approximate values of five independent parameters, a direct method needs additional constraints to solve the parameters. This paper proposes a new approach that facilitates a very fast but stable and accurate solution from five point correspondences between two overlapping aerial images taken form unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight. Furthermore, if 3D coordinates of perspective centers are available form geotagged images, rotational elements of the RO parameters can be quickly solved using three correspondences only. So it is very reliable for a provision of closed-form solutions for the rigorous methods. Our formulation regards Thompson’s parameterizations of Euler angles in composing a coplanarity condition. Nonlinear terms are subsequently added into a stereo parallax within a constant term under a linear least squares criteria. This strategy is considered new as compared with the known literatures since the proposed approach can find optimal solution. Results from real datasets confirm that our method produces a fast, stable and reliable linear solution by using at least five correspondences or even only three conjugate points of geotagged image pairs.",2019.0,2019-03-23,6,58,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00abb5e2d2bfeb932e65291acc95767d36159b42
10.3389/fmars.2023.1167818,Using computer vision to identify limpets from their shells: a case study using four species from the Baja California peninsula,"The shell morphology of limpets can be cryptic and highly variable, within and between species. Therefore, the visual identification of species can be troublesome even for experts. Here, we demonstrate the capability of computer vision models as a new method to assist with identifications. We investigate the ability of computers to distinguish between four species and two genera of limpets from the Baja California peninsula (Mexico) from digital images of shells from both dorsal and ventral orientations. Overall, the models performed marginally better (97.9%) than experts (97.5%) when predicting the same set of images and did so 240x faster. Moreover, we utilised a heatmap system to both verify that models are focussing on the specimens and to view which features on the specimens the models used to distinguish between species and genera. We then enlisted the expertise of limpet ecologists specialised in identification of species from the Baja peninsula to comment on whether the heatmaps are indeed focusing on specific morphological features per species/genus. They confirm that in their opinion, the majority of the heatmaps appear to be highlighting areas and features of morphological importance for distinguishing between groups. Our findings reveal that the cutting-edge technology of computer vision holds tremendous potential in enhancing species identification techniques used by taxonomists and ecologists. Not only does it provide a complementary approach to traditional methods, but it also opens new avenues for exploring the biology and ecology of limpets in greater detail.",2023.0,2023-07-27,0,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ad51691776c3ea4dd3c6d93c29e0e9b37e4c56

10.3390/mi14061155,An Arrhythmia Classification Model Based on Vision Transformer with Deformable Attention,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a highly effective non-invasive tool for monitoring heart activity and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Automatic detection of arrhythmia based on ECG plays a critical role in the early prevention and diagnosis of CVDs. In recent years, numerous studies have focused on using deep learning methods to address arrhythmia classification problems. However, the transformer-based neural network in current research still has a limited performance in detecting arrhythmias for the multi-lead ECG. In this study, we propose an end-to-end multi-label arrhythmia classification model for the 12-lead ECG with varied-length recordings. Our model, called CNN-DVIT, is based on a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with depthwise separable convolution, and a vision transformer structure with deformable attention. Specifically, we introduce the spatial pyramid pooling layer to accept varied-length ECG signals. Experimental results show that our model achieved an F1 score of 82.9% in CPSC-2018. Notably, our CNN-DVIT outperforms the latest transformer-based ECG classification algorithms. Furthermore, ablation experiments reveal that the deformable multi-head attention and depthwise separable convolution are both efficient in extracting features from multi-lead ECG signals for diagnosis. The CNN-DVIT achieved good performance for the automatic arrhythmia detection of ECG signals. This indicates that our research can assist doctors in clinical ECG analysis, providing important support for the diagnosis of arrhythmia and contributing to the development of computer-aided diagnosis technology.",2023.0,2023-05-30,19,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00aeb0ed9f96946c158b453e2bc773b6a8a5c75b
10.1109/TIP.2022.3214107,Color Alignment for Relative Color Constancy via Non-Standard References,"Relative colour constancy is an essential requirement for many scientific imaging applications. However, most digital cameras differ in their image formations and native sensor output is usually inaccessible, e.g., in smartphone camera applications. This makes it hard to achieve consistent colour assessment across a range of devices, and that undermines the performance of computer vision algorithms. To resolve this issue, we propose a colour alignment model that considers the camera image formation as a black-box and formulates colour alignment as a three-step process: camera response calibration, response linearisation, and colour matching. The proposed model works with non-standard colour references, i.e., colour patches without knowing the true colour values, by utilising a novel balance-of-linear-distances feature. It is equivalent to determining the camera parameters through an unsupervised process. It also works with a minimum number of corresponding colour patches across the images to be colour aligned to deliver the applicable processing. Three challenging image datasets collected by multiple cameras under various illumination and exposure conditions, including one that imitates uncommon scenes such as scientific imaging, were used to evaluate the model. Performance benchmarks demonstrated that our model achieved superior performance compared to other popular and state-of-the-art methods.",2021.0,2021-12-30,2,66,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b0a4959bbdc0ede61fdc5cdad4d1490229b3c5
10.1089/g4h.2016.0100,Impact of Gamification of Vision Tests on the User Experience.,"OBJECTIVE
Gamification has been incorporated into vision tests and vision therapies in the expectation that it may increase the user experience and engagement with the task. The current study aimed to understand how gamification affects the user experience, specifically during the undertaking of psychophysical tasks designed to estimate vision thresholds (chromatic and achromatic contrast sensitivity).


METHODS
Three tablet computer-based games were developed with three levels of gaming elements. Game 1 was designed to be a simple clinical test (no gaming elements), game 2 was similar to game 1 but with added gaming elements (i.e., feedback, scores, and sounds), and game 3 was a complete game. Participants (N = 144, age: 9.9-42 years) played three games in random order. The user experience for each game was assessed using a Short Feedback Questionnaire.


RESULTS
The median (interquartile range) fun level for the three games was 2.5 (1.6), 3.9 (1.7), and 2.5 (2.8), respectively. Overall, participants reported greater fun level and higher preparedness to play the game again for game 2 than games 1 and 3 (P < 0.05). There were significant positive correlations observed between fun level and preparedness to play the game again for all the games (p < 0.05). Engagement (assessed as completion rates) did not differ between the games.


CONCLUSION
Gamified version (game 2) was preferred to the other two versions. Over the short term, the careful application of gaming elements to vision tests was found to increase the fun level of users, without affecting engagement with the vision test.",2017.0,2017-08-01,15,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b0c47e657a105e108ecf2f704cd659dbc7796c

10.1101/2024.03.15.584610,FABEL: Forecasting Animal Behavioral Events with Deep Learning-Based Computer Vision,"Behavioral neuroscience aims to provide a connection between neural phenomena and emergent organism-level behaviors. This requires perturbing the nervous system and observing behavioral outcomes, and comparing observed post-perturbation behavior with predicted counterfactual behavior and therefore accurate behavioral forecasts. In this study we present FABEL, a deep learning method for forecasting future animal behaviors and locomotion trajectories from historical locomotion alone. We train an offline pose estimation network to predict animal body-part locations in behavioral video; then sequences of pose vectors are input to deep learning time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we train an LSTM network that predicts a future food interaction event in a specified time window, and a Temporal Fusion Transformer that predicts future trajectories of animal body-parts, which are then converted into probabilistic label forecasts. Importantly, accurate prediction of food interaction provides a basis for neurobehavioral intervention in the context of compulsive eating. We show promising results on forecasting tasks between 100 milliseconds and 5 seconds timescales. Because the model takes only behavioral video as input, it can be adapted to any behavioral task and does not require specific physiological readouts. Simultaneously, these deep learning models may serve as extensible modules that can accommodate diverse signals, such as in-vivo fluorescence imaging and electrophysiology, which may improve behavior forecasts and elucidate invervention targets for desired behavioral change.",2024.0,2024-03-17,0,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b371cb126f1de468b0994d360dd11489857651

In this paper, a flow-based interpolation method (FI-Net) is proposed. FI-Net is a lightweight end-to-end neural network that takes two frames in arbitrary size as input and outputs the estimated intermediate frame. Novelly, it computes optical flow at feature level instead of image level. Such practice can increase the accuracy of estimated flow. Multi-scale technique is utilized to handle large motions. For training, a comprehensive loss function that contains a novel content loss (Sobolev loss) and a semantic loss is introduced. It forces the generated frame to be close to the ground truth one at both pixel level and semantic level. We compare FI-Net with previous methods and it achieves higher performance with less time consumption and much smaller model size.",2019.0,,10,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b75d8ef0a8250a27e8dacedf8a6f4c4ca126d2

10.3390/sci2010008,Learning to Describe: A New Approach to Computer Vision Based Ancient Coin Analysis,"In recent years, a range of problems under the broad umbrella of computer vision based analysis of ancient coins have been attracting an increasing amount of attention. Notwithstanding this research effort, the results achieved by the state of the art in published literature remain poor and far from sufficiently well performing for any practical purpose. In the present paper we present a series of contributions which we believe will benefit the interested community. We explain that the approach of visual matching of coins, universally adopted in existing published papers on the topic, is not of practical interest because the number of ancient coin types exceeds by far the number of those types which have been imaged, be it in digital form (e.g., online) or otherwise (traditional film, in print, etc.). Rather, we argue that the focus should be on understanding the semantic content of coins. Hence, we describe a novel approach—to first extract semantic concepts from real-world multimodal input and associate them with their corresponding coin images, and then to train a convolutional neural network to learn the appearance of these concepts. On a real-world data set, we demonstrate highly promising results, correctly identifying a range of visual elements on unseen coins with up to 84% accuracy.",2020.0,2020-03-02,10,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ccd7cedaccf0d451621068b2b19b53b06c2af1

Fast classification and training play a key role in the development of the CNN. We hypothesize that the smoother and optimized the training of a CNN goes, the more efficient the end result becomes. Therefore, in this paper, we implement a modified resilient backpropagation (MRPROP) algorithm to improve the convergence and efficiency of CNN training. Particularly, a tolerant band is introduced to avoid network overtraining, which is incorporated with the global best concept for weight updating criteria to allow the training algorithm of the CNN to optimize its weights more swiftly and precisely. For comparison, we present and analyze four different training algorithms for CNN along with MRPROP, i.e., resilient backpropagation (RPROP), Levenberg–Marquardt (LM), conjugate gradient (CG), and gradient descent with momentum (GDM).

10.3390/RS10081299,Extraction of Sample Plot Parameters from 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction Based on Combined RTK and CCD Continuous Photography,"Enriching forest resource inventory is important to ensure the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Obtaining forest inventory data from the field has always been difficult, laborious, time consuming, and expensive. Advances in integrating photogrammetry and computer vision have helped researchers develop some numeric algorithms and methods that can turn 2D (images) into 3D (point clouds) and are highly applicable to forestry. This paper aimed to develop a new, highly accurate methodology that extracts sample plot parameters based on continuous terrestrial photogrammetry. For this purpose, we designed and implemented a terrestrial observation instrument combining real-time kinematic (RTK) and charge-coupled device (CCD) continuous photography. Then, according to the set observation plan, three independent experimental plots were continuously photographed and the 3D point cloud of the plot was generated. From this 3D point cloud, the tree position coordinates, tree DBHs, tree heights, and other plot characteristics of the forest were extracted. The plot characteristics obtained from the 3D point cloud were compared with the measurement data obtained from the field to check the accuracy of our methodology. We obtained the position coordinates of the trees with the positioning accuracy (RMSE) of 0.162 m to 0.201 m. The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of the trunk diameter measurements was 3.07% to 4.51%, which met the accuracy requirements of traditional forestry surveys. The hypsometrical measurements were due to the occlusion of the forest canopy and the estimated rRMSE was 11.26% to 11.91%, which is still good reference data. Furthermore, these image-based point cloud data also have portable observation instruments, low data collection costs, high field measurement efficiency, automatic data processing, and they can directly extract tree geographic location information, which may be interesting and important for certain applications such as the protection of registered famous trees. For forest inventory, continuous terrestrial photogrammetry with its unique advantages is a solution that deserves future attention in the field of tree detection and ecological construction.",2018.0,2018-08-17,38,58,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00d387c1787ad21e16c421d91ad0e7622ccd6497

10.3390/agronomy14102194,Performance Analysis of YOLO and Detectron2 Models for Detecting Corn and Soybean Pests Employing Customized Dataset,"One of the most challenging aspects of agricultural pest control is accurate detection of insects in crops. Inadequate control measures for insect pests can seriously impact the production of corn and soybean plantations. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been extensively used for detecting insect pests in the field. In this line of research, this paper introduces a method to detect four key insect species that are predominant in Brazilian agriculture. Our model relies on computer vision techniques, including You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Detectron2, and adapts them to lightweight formats—TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)—for resource-constrained devices. Our method leverages two datasets: a comprehensive one and a smaller sample for comparison purposes. With this setup, the authors aimed at using these two datasets to evaluate the performance of the computer vision models and subsequently convert the best-performing models into TFLite and ONNX formats, facilitating their deployment on edge devices. The results are promising. Even in the worst-case scenario, where the ONNX model with the reduced dataset was compared to the YOLOv9-gelan model with the full dataset, the precision reached 87.3%, and the accuracy achieved was 95.0%.",2024.0,2024-09-24,2,85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00d83c7c41dc6c40ff6cd444dd4621fdbf4379a7

10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3412412,Optimizing Tumor Classification Through Transfer Learning and Particle Swarm Optimization-Driven Feature Extraction,"Brain tumors pose a significant threat, especially when not detected early. The Inception v3 machine learning model has found extensive applications in computer vision and related fields. This study aims to develop a robust transfer learning model for classification, adaptable to various data modalities through neural networks. However, the training process for these neural networks is complex, being both demanding and computationally intensive. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an innovative training approach for Inception v3 referred to as ‘PSO-INCEPT’ (Particle Swarm Optimization-based Inception v3 training). In this method, the weight vectors for each Inception v3 model are analogized to particle positions in a phase space. The PSO cooperates with the ADAM optimizer in achieving the purpose of training with the best performance and generalization. This research is composed of two main parts, the first stage is being performed by the model independently using the ADAM optimizer. In the following stage, PSO-INCEPT models share the latest weight vectors or particle coordinates and loss function approximations via training. The optimization function then uses them to improve the validation accuracy. The effectiveness of PSO-INCEPT was evaluated through experiments that were conducted on Kaggle datasets that provide a common base ground by having four distinct classes. Experimental studies have proven the extraordinary ability of the proposed model by providing 99.33% validation accuracy and 99.95% training accuracy which shows exceptional performance.",2024.0,,3,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e026460775e8f2522cfeb7c3f77493c703f5a5

10.3390/s23177312,DUA: A Domain-Unified Approach for Cross-Dataset 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Human pose estimation is an important Computer Vision problem, whose goal is to estimate the human body through joints. Currently, methods that employ deep learning techniques excel in the task of 2D human pose estimation. However, the use of 3D poses can bring more accurate and robust results. Since 3D pose labels can only be acquired in restricted scenarios, fully convolutional methods tend to perform poorly on the task. One strategy to solve this problem is to use 2D pose estimators, to estimate 3D poses in two steps using 2D pose inputs. Due to database acquisition constraints, the performance improvement of this strategy can only be observed in controlled environments, therefore domain adaptation techniques can be used to increase the generalization capability of the system by inserting information from synthetic domains. In this work, we propose a novel method called Domain Unified approach, aimed at solving pose misalignment problems on a cross-dataset scenario, through a combination of three modules on top of the pose estimator: pose converter, uncertainty estimator, and domain classifier. Our method led to a 44.1mm (29.24%) error reduction, when training with the SURREAL synthetic dataset and evaluating with Human3.6M over a no-adaption scenario, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",2023.0,2023-08-22,3,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e6a0779194249977f2a36561b7a5d2244a5c37

In this research article, we have proposed a framework for human and object interaction in real-life examples such as sports and other activities. Initially, we reviewed video-based data by considering the three state-of-the-art data sets. Preprocessing steps have been followed to avoid extra costs, such as video-to-frame conversion, noise reduction and background subtraction. Human silhouette extraction has been performed via the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and supper pixel model. Next, human body points and object location detection were performed. Finally, human and object-based features have been extracted. To minimize the features replication and to achieve optimized results, we have applied stochastic gradient descent and Restricted Boltzmann Machine; As a result, we have achieved an accuracy of 88.46%, 82.00%, and 88.30% on human body parts recognition over the MPII dataset, UCF_aerial dataset, and wild Dataset respectively. The classification accuracy for the MPII dataset is 92.71%, for the UCF_aerial dataset is 90.60%, and for sports video in the wild Dataset is 92.42%.

The approach makes use of computer vision techniques and deep learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is used for individual frame classification and image feature extraction, and a deep long short-term memory (LSTM) network, used to capture temporal information present in a sequence of image feature sets and to make a final vapor quality or flow regime classification. This novel architecture for two-phase flow studies achieves accurate flow regime and vapor quality classifications in a practical application to two-phase CO2 flow in vertical tubes, based on offline data and an online prototype implementation, developed as a proof of concept for the use of these models within a feedback control loop. The use of automatically selected image features, produced by a CNN architecture in three distinct tasks comprising flow-image classification, flow-regime classification, and vapor quality prediction, confirms that these features are robust and useful, and offer a viable alternative to manually extracting image features for image-based flow studies.

10.1109/TBME.2022.3212192,A Binocular Vision SSVEP Brain–Computer Interface Paradigm for Dual-Frequency Modulation,"Objective: This study presents a novel brain-computer interface paradigm of dual-frequency modulated steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), aiming to suppress the unpredictable intermodulation components in current applications. This paradigm is especially suitable for training-free scenarios. Approach: This study built a dual-frequency binocular vision SSVEP brain-computer interface system using circularly polarized light technology. Two experiments, including a 6-target offline experiment and a 40-target online experiment, were taken with this system. Meanwhile, an improved algorithm filter bank dual-frequency canonical correlation analysis (FBDCCA) was presented for the dual-frequency SSVEP paradigm. Main results: Energy analysis was conducted for 9 subjects in the 6-target dual-frequency offline experiment, among which the signal-to-noise ratio of target frequency components have increased by 2 dB compared to the one of unpredictable intermodulation components. Subsequently, the online experiment with 40 targets was conducted with 12 subjects. With this new dual-frequency paradigm, the online training-free experiment's average information transmission rate (ITR) reached 104.56 $\pm$ 15.74 bits/min, which was almost twice as fast as the current best dual-frequency paradigm. And the average information transfer rate for offline training analysis of this new paradigm was 180.87 $\pm$ 17.88 bits/min. Significance: These results demonstrate that this new dual-frequency SSVEP brain-computer interface paradigm can suppress the unpredictable intermodulation harmonics and generate higher quality responses while completing dual-frequency encoding. Moreover, its performance shows high ITR in applications both with and without training. It is thus believed that this paradigm is competent for achieving large target numbers in brain-computer interface systems and has more possible practices.",2022.0,2022-10-05,10,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00f90f0446cf66f3c240d233f539afe16e701fba

10.3390/s24227242,Measuring Changes in Upper Body Movement Due to Fasting Using a Camera,"Understanding activity levels during fasting is important for promoting healthy fasting practices. While most existing studies focus on step counts to objectively assess the impact of fasting on activity levels and behavioral changes, the results have been mixed. Despite evidence showing that individuals spend a significant amount of time sitting while fasting, there has been no objective measurement of body movement or activity levels during sitting and fasting. This research employs a video-based, unobtrusive human body movement measurement system to monitor upper body movements during fasting and non-fasting periods over several days. Key movement features, such as inactivity, movement speed, and movement scale, were automatically extracted from the video monitoring data using a computer vision pipeline. These features were then statistically compared using t tests between fasting and non-fasting periods, analyzed by hour of the day and across different days.

10.1109/TMI.2023.3283948,Spatial-Intensity Transforms for Medical Image-to-Image Translation,"Image-to-image translation has seen major advances in computer vision but can be difficult to apply to medical images, where imaging artifacts and data scarcity degrade the performance of conditional generative adversarial networks. We develop the spatial-intensity transform (SIT) to improve output image quality while closely matching the target domain. SIT constrains the generator to a smooth spatial transform (diffeomorphism) composed with sparse intensity changes. SIT is a lightweight, modular network component that is effective on various architectures and training schemes. Relative to unconstrained baselines, this technique significantly improves image fidelity, and our models generalize robustly to different scanners. Additionally, SIT provides a disentangled view of anatomical and textural changes for each translation, making it easier to interpret the model’s predictions in terms of physiological phenomena. We demonstrate SIT on two tasks: predicting longitudinal brain MRIs in patients with various stages of neurodegeneration, and visualizing changes with age and stroke severity in clinical brain scans of stroke patients. On the first task, our model accurately forecasts brain aging trajectories without supervised training on paired scans. On the second task, it captures associations between ventricle expansion and aging, as well as between white matter hyperintensities and stroke severity. As conditional generative models become increasingly versatile tools for visualization and forecasting, our approach demonstrates a simple and powerful technique for improving robustness, which is critical for translation to clinical settings.

Accurate and precise diagnosis of plant diseases has been a significant challenge. Cost-effective automated computational systems for disease diagnosis would facilitate advancements in agriculture. The objective of this paper is to explore computer vision based Artificial Intelligence method for automating the identification of yellow rust disease and improve the accuracy of plant disease identification. The dataset of 2000 images of wheat leaf were collected in the real life experimental conditions of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi in the crop season during January-April, 2019. Based on our experiment, we propose a deep learning-based approach to detect healthy leaves and yellow rust infected leaves in the wheat crop. The experiments are implemented in python with PyCharm IDE, utilizing the Keras deep learning library backend with TensorFlow. The proposed model achieves 97.3% testing accuracy and 98.42% as the training accuracy. The accuracy of the developed model can be improved further by training it with larger size of the dataset in future.

In these domains, users also seek understanding of “why” a class was chosen and “why not” an alternative class. A new GenerAlized expLanatiOn fRamEwork (GALORE) is proposed to satisfy all these requirements, by unifying attributive explanations with explanations of two other types. The first is a new class of explanations, denoted deliberative, proposed to address the “why” question, by exposing the network insecurities about a prediction. The second is the class of counterfactual explanations, which have been shown to address the “why not” question but are now more efficiently computed. GALORE unifies these explanations by defining them as combinations of attribution maps with respect to various classifier predictions and a confidence score. An evaluation protocol that leverages object recognition (CUB200) and scene classification (ADE20 K) datasets combining part and attribute annotations is also proposed.

10.4103/ojo.ojo_283_21,Awareness and practice regarding use of digital devices and ocular health among Saudi adolescents,"PURPOSE: To review the knowledge of ocular health and practices of digital device usage among adolescent Saudi Arabia population. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in 2021 at a university in central Saudi Arabia. We asked questions regarding demographics, knowledge related to computer vision syndrome (CVS), and the use of digital devices for participants' daily activities. The acceptable grades of knowledge (”excellent” and “good”) and practice scores were associated with the determinants using the nonparametric method of analysis. RESULTS: Of 521 participating students, knowledge about CVS and its relation to digital device usage were excellent in 41 students (7.9%), good in 161 (39%), poor in 300 (57.6%), and very poor in 19 (3.6%). Twenty-eight (5.4%) students scored an “excellent” grade on practices for digital device usage, 216 (41.4%) scored “good,” and 277 (53.2%) scored “poor.” The knowledge score median was 1.0 (interquartile range 1.0; 2.0), and the practice score median was 6.0 (4.0; 9.0). Health studies students had better knowledge than other students (P = 0.004). Smartphone users had worse knowledge than users of other devices (P = 0.017).

In daily life, this technology is used in the photo recognition of e-commerce platforms. However, the timing of the identification process grows into a major problem. Therefore, it is particularly important to reduce the recognition time by optimizing the deep learning model.

In the first experiment, the method of scaling down convolutional kernel has an important optimization effect for training the deep learning model of small data sets. In another experiment using L-1 pruning algorithm greatly improves the running speed of models by reducing the size of models. To sum up, the optimization method proposed above for the convolutional neural network model on the mobile end can be applied in the field that requires a large amount of image classification, such as delivery package sorting.

10.1002/ece3.4747,"Animal Scanner: Software for classifying humans, animals, and empty frames in camera trap images","Abstract Camera traps are a popular tool to sample animal populations because they are noninvasive, detect a variety of species, and can record many thousands of animal detections per deployment. Cameras are typically set to take bursts of multiple photographs for each detection and are deployed in arrays of dozens or hundreds of sites, often resulting in millions of photographs per study. The task of converting photographs to animal detection records from such large image collections is daunting, and made worse by situations that generate copious empty pictures from false triggers (e.g., camera malfunction or moving vegetation) or pictures of humans. We developed computer vision algorithms to detect and classify moving objects to aid the first step of camera trap image filtering—separating the animal detections from the empty frames and pictures of humans. Our new work couples foreground object segmentation through background subtraction with deep learning classification to provide a fast and accurate scheme for human–animal detection. We provide these programs as both Matlab GUI and command prompt developed with C++. The software reads folders of camera trap images and outputs images annotated with bounding boxes around moving objects and a text file summary of results. This software maintains high accuracy while reducing the execution time by 14 times. It takes about 6 seconds to process a sequence of ten frames (on a 2.6 GHZ CPU computer). For those cameras with excessive empty frames due to camera malfunction or blowing vegetation automatically removes 54% of the false‐triggers sequences without influencing the human/animal sequences. We achieve 99.58% on image‐level empty versus object classification of Serengeti dataset. We offer the first computer vision tool for processing camera trap images providing substantial time savings for processing large image datasets, thus improving our ability to monitor wildlife across large scales with camera traps.",2019.0,2019-02-01,61,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01266d9db4fc729ed08499fc851f6fd246c03b0b

Large well-defined heterogeneous compositions of pedestrian footfall and physical proximity are difficult to acquire, yet necessary to monitor city-wide activity (busyness) and consequently discern actionable policy decisions. To meet this challenge, we leverage our existing large-scale data processing urban air quality machine learning infrastructure to process over 900 camera feeds in near real-time to generate new estimates of social distancing adherence, group detection and camera stability. In this work, we describe our development and deployment of a computer vision and machine learning pipeline. It provides near immediate sampling and contextualization of activity and physical distancing on the streets of London via live traffic camera feeds. We introduce a platform for inspecting, calibrating and improving upon existing methods, describe the active deployment on real-time feeds and provide analysis over an 18 month period.",2020.0,2020-12-07,5,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012be9ad6062d7a3170f20621c47b042220cc417

Video surveillance is an essential tool for monitoring public areas, buildings, and other locations for security and safety purposes. However, analyzing the vast amount of data generated by video surveillance systems can be challenging. Real-time face detection and object detection systems provide an effective solution to this problem, enabling the identification and tracking of people and objects of interest. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in incorporating age prediction and gender prediction into video surveillance systems. The ability to predict the age and gender of individuals can provide valuable insights to enhance the effectiveness of video surveillance applications. For example, age and gender prediction can be used to detect and prevent potential crimes. This research paper presents a study of a real-time face and object detection system with age and gender prediction for video surveillance applications. The proposed system utilizes deep learning and convolutional neural network techniques to achieve high accuracy in face and object detection, as well as age and gender prediction. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in accurately detecting and tracking faces and objects while predicting their age and gender in real time. The proposed system has potential applications in various fields",2023.0,2023-03-31,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012d304350a4fde3a30a738361710d49fbeda857

10.3390/s23073390,3D-DIoU: 3D Distance Intersection over Union for Multi-Object Tracking in Point Cloud,"Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a prominent and important study in point cloud processing and computer vision. The main objective of MOT is to predict full tracklets of several objects in point cloud. Occlusion and similar objects are two common problems that reduce the algorithm’s performance throughout the tracking phase. The tracking performance of current MOT techniques, which adopt the ‘tracking-by-detection’ paradigm, is degrading, as evidenced by increasing numbers of identification (ID) switch and tracking drifts because it is difficult to perfectly predict the location of objects in complex scenes that are unable to track. Since the occluded object may have been visible in former frames, we manipulated the speed and location position of the object in the previous frames in order to guess where the occluded object might have been. In this paper, we employed a unique intersection over union (IoU) method in three-dimension (3D) planes, namely a distance IoU non-maximum suppression (DIoU-NMS) to accurately detect objects, and consequently we use 3D-DIoU for an object association process in order to increase tracking robustness and speed. By using a hybrid 3D DIoU-NMS and 3D-DIoU method, the tracking speed improved significantly. Experimental findings on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that our multistage data association and tracking technique has clear benefits over previously developed algorithms in terms of tracking accuracy. In comparison with other 3D MOT tracking methods, our proposed approach demonstrates significant enhancement in tracking performances.",2023.0,2023-03-23,7,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01326a7f64af7cd4450cf3612af85f57293ea885

10.1515/cdbme-2019-0053,Modeling and Analysis of a Visual Feedback System to Support Efficient Object Grasping of an EMG-Controlled Prosthetic Hand,"Abstract Millions of people around the world have lost their upper limbs mainly due to accidents and wars. Recently in the Middle East, the demand for prosthetic limbs has increased dramatically due to ongoing wars in the region. Commercially available prosthetic limbs are expensive while the most economical method available for controlling prosthetic limbs is the Electromyography (EMG). Researchers on EMG-controlled prosthetic limbs are facing several challenges, which include efficiency problems in terms of functionality especially in prosthetic hands. A major issue that needs to be solved is the fact that currently available low-cost EMG-controlled prosthetic hands cannot enable the user to grasp various types of objects in various shapes, and cannot provide the efficient use of the object by deciding the necessary hand gesture. In this paper, a computer vision-based mechanism is proposed with the purpose of detecting and recognizing objects and applying optimal hand gesture through visual feedback. The objects are classified into groups and the optimal hand gesture to grasp and use the targeted object that is most efficient for the user is implemented. A simulation model of the human hand kinematics is developed for simulation tests to reveal the efficacy of the proposed method. 80 different types of objects are detected, recognized, and classified for simulation tests, which can be realized by using two electrodes supplying the input to perform the action. Simulation results reveal the performance of proposed EMG-controlled prosthetic hand in maintaining optimal hand gestures in computer environment. Results are promising to help disabled people handle and use objects more efficiently without higher costs.",2019.0,2019-09-01,1,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0136d014f308545cf5bf6927d412e623fce83029
10.3390/educsci13020141,Engagement Assessment for the Educational Web-Service Based on Largest Lyapunov Exponent Calculation for User Reaction Time Series,"Contemporary digital platforms provide a large number of web services for learning and professional growth. In most cases, educational web services only control access when connecting to resources and platforms. However, for educational and similar resources (internet surveys, online research), which are characterized by interactive interaction with the platform, it is important to assess user engagement in the learning process. A fairly large body of research is devoted to assessing learner engagement based on automatic, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Those methods include self-observation, observation checklists, engagement tracing based on learner reaction time and accuracy, computer vision methods (analysis of facial expressions, gestures, and postures, eye movements), methods for analyzing body sensor data, etc. Computer vision and body sensor methods for assessing engagement give a more complete objective picture of the learner’s state for further analysis in comparison with the methods of engagement tracing based on learner’s reaction time, however, they require the presence of appropriate sensors, which may often not be applicable in a particular context. Sensory observation is explicit to the learner and is an additional stressor, such as knowing the learner is being captured by the webcam while solving a problem. Thus, the further development of the hidden engagement assessment methods is relevant, while new computationally efficient techniques of converting the initial signal about the learner’s reaction time to assess engagement can be applied. On the basis of the hypothesis about the randomness of the dynamics of the time series, the largest Lyapunov exponent can be calculated for the time series formed from the reaction time of learners during prolonged work with web interfaces to assess the learner’s engagement. A feature of the proposed engagement assessment method is the relatively high computational efficiency, absence of high traffic loads in comparison with computer vision as well as secrecy from the learner coupled with no processing of learner’s personal or physical data except the reaction time to questions displayed on the screen. The results of experimental studies on a large amount of data are presented, demonstrating the applicability of the selected technique for learner’s engagement assessment.",2023.0,2023-01-30,1,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0136e8e60d72de5b7a4dcb56303d5d764b6cba09
10.3390/rs61212334,Automatic Seamline Network Generation for Urban Orthophoto Mosaicking with the Use of a Digital Surface Model,"Intelligent seamline selection for image mosaicking is an area of active research in the fields of massive data processing, computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing. In mosaicking applications for digital orthophoto maps (DOMs), the visual transition in mosaics is mainly caused by differences in positioning accuracy, image tone and relief displacement of high ground objects between overlapping DOMs. Among these three factors, relief displacement, which prevents the seamless mosaicking of images, is relatively more difficult to address. To minimize visual discontinuities, many optimization algorithms have been studied for the automatic selection of seamlines to avoid high ground objects. Thus, a new automatic seamline selection algorithm using a digital surface model (DSM) is proposed. The main idea of this algorithm is to guide a seamline toward a low area on the basis of the elevation information in a DSM. Given that the elevation of a DSM is not completely synchronous with a DOM, a new model, called the orthoimage elevation synchronous model (OESM), is derived and introduced. OESM can accurately reflect the elevation information for each DOM unit. Through the morphological processing of the OESM data in the overlapping area, an initial path network is obtained for seamline selection. Subsequently, a cost function is defined on the basis of several measurements, and Dijkstra’s algorithm is adopted to determine the least-cost path from the initial network. Finally, the proposed algorithm is employed for automatic seamline network construction; the effective mosaic polygon of each image is determined, and a seamless mosaic is generated. The experiments with three different datasets indicate that the proposed method meets the requirements for seamline network construction. In comparative trials, the generated seamlines pass through fewer ground objects with low time consumption.",2014.0,2014-12-09,40,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0136eb27acace0af14d7457a813b1ceb321e71dd

10.1093/jas/skab022,ASAS-NANP SYMPOSIUM: Applications of machine learning for livestock body weight prediction from digital images,"Abstract Monitoring, recording, and predicting livestock body weight (BW) allows for timely intervention in diets and health, greater efficiency in genetic selection, and identification of optimal times to market animals because animals that have already reached the point of slaughter represent a burden for the feedlot. There are currently two main approaches (direct and indirect) to measure the BW in livestock. Direct approaches include partial-weight or full-weight industrial scales placed in designated locations on large farms that measure passively or dynamically the weight of livestock. While these devices are very accurate, their acquisition, intended purpose and operation size, repeated calibration and maintenance costs associated with their placement in high-temperature variability, and corrosive environments are significant and beyond the affordability and sustainability limits of small and medium size farms and even of commercial operators. As a more affordable alternative to direct weighing approaches, indirect approaches have been developed based on observed or inferred relationships between biometric and morphometric measurements of livestock and their BW. Initial indirect approaches involved manual measurements of animals using measuring tapes and tubes and the use of regression equations able to correlate such measurements with BW. While such approaches have good BW prediction accuracies, they are time consuming, require trained and skilled farm laborers, and can be stressful for both animals and handlers especially when repeated daily. With the concomitant advancement of contactless electro-optical sensors (e.g., 2D, 3D, infrared cameras), computer vision (CV) technologies, and artificial intelligence fields such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), 2D and 3D images have started to be used as biometric and morphometric proxies for BW estimations. This manuscript provides a review of CV-based and ML/DL-based BW prediction methods and discusses their strengths, weaknesses, and industry applicability potential.",2021.0,2021-02-01,49,126,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/013cc41b3b52b95d1e235de6f2aba3f2006e7ef1

The solution enhances accessibility by addressing the needs of individuals with injuries or disabilities who may require help with common manipulation tasks. The aim of this paper is to propose a method involving vision, manipulation, and learning techniques to effectively address the task of bottle opening. The process begins with the acquisition of bottle and cap positions using an RGB-D camera and computer vision. Subsequently, the robot picks the bottle with one gripper and grips the cap with the other, each by planning safe trajectories. Then, the opening procedure is executed via a position and force control scheme that ensures both grippers follow the unscrewing path defined by the cap thread. Within the control loop, force sensor information is employed to control the vertical axis movements, while gripper rotation control is achieved through a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm trained to determine the optimal angle increments for rotation. The results demonstrate the successful training of the learning agent. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in bottle opening with the TIAGo++ robot, showcasing the practical viability of the approach.",2024.0,2024-09-01,1,39,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/013dc1e6469e600db0d11789d975359a5ce67115

These trials consist of thousands of plots, each containing a unique crop variety monitored at intervals during the growing season, requiring considerable manual effort. In this study, we combined satellite imagery and deep learning techniques to automatically collect plot-level phenotypes from plant breeding trials in South Australia and Sonora, Mexico. We implemented two novel methods, utilising state-of-the-art computer vision architectures, to predict plot-level phenotypes: flowering, canopy cover, greenness, height, biomass, and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). The first approach uses a classification model to predict for just the centred plot. The second approach predicts per-pixel and then aggregates predictions to determine a value per-plot. Using a modified ResNet18 model to predict the centred plot was found to be the most effective method.

Within this field, the primate visual pathway and its hierarchical organization have been extensively studied. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the understanding of observed biological structure and function, have been successfully applied to visual recognition and classification tasks. In addition, implementations on neuromorphic hardware have enabled large-scale networks to run in (or even faster than) real time, making spike-based neural vision processing accessible on mobile robots. Neuromorphic sensors such as silicon retinas are able to feed such mobile systems with real-time visual stimuli. A new set of vision benchmarks for spike-based neural processing are now needed to measure progress quantitatively within this rapidly advancing field. We propose that a large dataset of spike-based visual stimuli is needed to provide meaningful comparisons between different systems, and a corresponding evaluation methodology is also required to measure the performance of SNN models and their hardware implementations. In this paper we first propose an initial NE (Neuromorphic Engineering) dataset based on standard computer vision benchmarksand that uses digits from the MNIST database. This dataset is compatible with the state of current research on spike-based image recognition. The corresponding spike trains are produced using a range of techniques: rate-based Poisson spike generation, rank order encoding, and recorded output from a silicon retina with both flashing and oscillating input stimuli. In addition, a complementary evaluation methodology is presented to assess both model-level and hardware-level performance. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the dataset and the evaluation methodology using two SNN models to validate the performance of the models and their hardware implementations. With this dataset we hope to (1) promote meaningful comparison between algorithms in the field of neural computation, (2) allow comparison with conventional image recognition methods, (3) provide an assessment of the state of the art in spike-based visual recognition, and (4) help researchers identify future directions and advance the field.",2016.0,2016-11-02,32,78,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/015146a94f41db5abd92551a4334fd7daae468bf

To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach by using a cograph regularized collective nonnegative matrix factorization method to annotate images, which is referred to as CG-CNMF; CG-CNMF maximizes the annotation consistency for each image and minimizes the semantic gap for good annotation performance. To reduce the computation cost, this method formulates the annotation problem as a recommending issue and uses nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to recover the image-to-label relation for the testing images. Moreover, to find the most similar latent image features and latent label features during the matrix factorization, it exploits the image-to-image relation and label-to-label relation by utilizing the visual content information of images and the semantic cooccurrence information of labels, respectively. To reduce the semantic gap between the image visual content and semantic concepts, both the semantic features and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based visual features are considered. Moreover, to address the label-imbalance and incomplete-label problems, the visual-based label cooccurrence information is also considered. In this way, visually similar images are highly correlated with the true semantics of the test images. The experimental results for three multilabel image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method.",2019.0,,6,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01521631bca8d944a2446bfdaa845dfaa2ad949f

The article discusses the process of creating a computer vision algorithm that allows the user to detect water globules in oil samples and analyze their sizes. The process of developing an algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) YOLOv4 is presented. For this study, our own empirical base was proposed, which comprised microphotographs of samples of raw materials and water–oil emulsions taken at various points and in different operating modes of an oil refinery. The number of images for training the neural network algorithm was increased by applying the authors’ augmentation algorithm. The developed program makes it possible to detect particles in a fluid medium with the level of accuracy required by a researcher, which can be controlled at the stage of training the CNN. Based on the results of processing the output data from the algorithm, a dispersion analysis of localized water globules was carried out, supplemented with a frequency diagram describing the ratio of the size and number of particles found. The evaluation of the quality of the results of the work of the intelligent algorithm in comparison with the manual method on the verification microphotographs and the comparison of two empirical distributions allow us to conclude that the model based on the CNN can be verified and accepted for use in the search for particles in a fluid medium.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993777,Correlation Filter With Motion Detection for Robust Tracking of Shape-Deformed Targets,"Target tracking is an important area of research in computer vision where stable target’s tracking has been well solved. But in real world, it is difficult to ensure that the camera or lens could be fixed and the target could maintain its shape in whole video sequence. And as a result, in these unstable cases, robust tracking algorithms have to deal with the problem of target shape-deforming. Once the scenes video sequence contains shape-deformed target, tracking become a real challenging problem. Most previous tracking algorithms based on craft features only used HOG or/and CN features. This paper proposed an algorithm named as Correlation Filtering with Motion Detection (CFMD). This algorithm takes into account the camera shake and target motion information of the video sequence. After removing the effects of lens shake and camera movement, this algorithm can predict the motion information of the target, thereby effectively improving the tracking accuracy and robustness. In CFMD, the target position is determined by the weighted outputs of motion detection and correlation filter tracker. We evaluated our CMFD algorithm on the OTB-100 and VOT-2018 dataset compared with other target tracking algorithms, including Kernel Correlation Filter (KCF), Scale Adaptive with Multiple Features tracker (SAMF), Discriminative Scale Space Tracker (DSST), and Sum of Template and Pixel-wise LEarners (Staple), Learning Spatial-Temporal Regularized Correlation Filters for Visual Tracking(STRCF), Multi-Cue Correlation Filters for Robust Visual Tracking(MCCT). The experimental results showed that our algorithm owns the property of robust tracking of shape-deformed targets in video sequences containing lens shaking or camera moving and it achieves the state-of-the-art precision and tracking effects.",2020.0,,13,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/016f1d395c5930e027706dad0ea0abccb3e7039c

We characterize a set of computationally derived enzyme-substrate (ES) structures showing an important role of coordination shells of magnesium ions in the solvent accessible active site. In the lowest energy ES conformation, the coordination shell of MgA2+ does not include the Oδ1 atom of the conserved Asp440 residue. Starting from this conformation, a one-step reaction mechanism is characterized which includes proton transfer from the ribose O3'H3' group in ATP to Asp440 via a shuttling water molecule concerted with PA-O3A bond cleavage and O3'-PA bond formation. The energy profile of this route is consistent with the observed reaction kinetics. The computed energy profiles initiated from higher energy ES complexes are characterized by larger energy expenses to complete the reaction. Consistently with experimental data, we show that the Asp440Ala mutant of the enzyme should exhibit a reduced but retained activity.

10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b05384,Human Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 is an Isomerase: Carboxyl Transfer is Activated by Catalytic Effect of Isomerization.,"Obesity and its related diseases such as cancer and diabetics are leading life-threatening issues in modern world. Thus, new drugs toward obesity and obesity caused diseases are highly desired. Human acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (hACC1) in charge of rate-limiting step of human fatty acid synthesis was recognized as an attractive target for rational drug design. The fundamental reaction mechanism and the nature of transtion state of hACC1 remain unclear. In this study, combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy simulations were performed to investigate the catalytic mechanism of hACC1 catalyzed carboxyl transfer reaction. Our computational results show a three-step mechanism for CT catalyzed reaction, including isomerization of carboxybiotin, proton transfer from acetyl-CoA to carboxybiotin, and carboxylation of acetyl-CoA enolate. Interestingly, isomerization of carboxybiotin is the rate-limiting step of the entire reaction pathway, indicating hACC1 has the catalytic effect of isomerization and thus might be an isomerase as well. The activation free energy barrier of carboxyl transfer catalyzed by hACC1 was calculated to be 16.4 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with experimental result (16.7 kcal/mol). The obtained reaction mechanism together with the nature of transition state provide helpful knowledge not only for future investigation of other ACCs but also for rational design of hACC1 inhibitors, such as TS analogue.

10.3390/sym2020970,"Noether Symmetries and Covariant Conservation Laws in Classical, Relativistic and Quantum Physics","We review the Lagrangian formulation of (generalised) Noether symmetries in the framework of Calculus of Variations in Jet Bundles, with a special attention to so-called “Natural Theories” and “Gauge-Natural Theories” that include all relevant Field Theories and physical applications (from Mechanics to General Relativity, to Gauge Theories, Supersymmetric Theories, Spinors, etc.). It is discussed how the use of Poincar´e–Cartan forms and decompositions of natural (or gauge-natural) variational operators give rise to notions such as “generators of Noether symmetries”, energy and reduced energy flow, Bianchi identities, weak and strong conservation laws, covariant conservation laws, Hamiltonian-like conservation laws (such as, e.g., so-calledADMlaws in General Relativity) with emphasis on the physical interpretation of the quantities calculated in specific cases (energy, angular momentum, entropy, etc.). A few substantially new and very recent applications/examples are presented to better show the power of the methods introduced: one in Classical Mechanics (definition of strong conservation laws in a frame-independent setting and a discussion on the way in which conserved quantities depend on the choice of an observer); one in Classical Field Theories (energy and entropy in General Relativity, in its standard formulation, in its spin-frame formulation, in its first order formulation “a la Palatini” and in its extensions to Non-Linear Gravity Theories); one in Quantum Field Theories (applications to conservation laws in Loop Quantum Gravity via spin connections and Barbero–Immirzi connections).",2010.0,2010-01-17,18,39,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e3a6be8537162fd112b3a0a51a6063b640997
10.26740/jpfa.v9n2.p92-104,Quantum Propagator Derivation for the Ring of Four Harmonically Coupled Oscillators,"The ring model of the coupled oscillator has enormously studied from the perspective of quantum mechanics. The research efforts on this system contribute to fully grasp the concepts of energy transport, dissipation, among others, in mesoscopic and condensed matter systems. In this research, the dynamics of the quantum propagator for the ring of oscillators was analyzed anew. White noise analysis was applied to derive the quantum mechanical propagator for a ring of four harmonically coupled oscillators. The process was done after performing four successive coordinate transformations obtaining four separated Lagrangian of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Then, the individual propagator was evaluated via white noise path integration where the full propagator is expressed as the product of the individual propagators. In particular, the frequencies of the first two propagators correspond to degenerate normal mode frequencies, while the other two correspond to non-degenerate normal mode frequencies. The full propagator was expressed in its symmetric form to extract the energy spectrum and the wave function.",2019.0,2019-12-31,0,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e8c39cc860aba71783bd54acd8ac174427153

10.3390/e23081095,The Problem of Engines in Statistical Physics,"Engines are open systems that can generate work cyclically at the expense of an external disequilibrium. They are ubiquitous in nature and technology, but the course of mathematical physics over the last 300 years has tended to make their dynamics in time a theoretical blind spot. This has hampered the usefulness of statistical mechanics applied to active systems, including living matter. We argue that recent advances in the theory of open quantum systems, coupled with renewed interest in understanding how active forces result from positive feedback between different macroscopic degrees of freedom in the presence of dissipation, point to a more realistic description of autonomous engines. We propose a general conceptualization of an engine that helps clarify the distinction between its heat and work outputs. Based on this, we show how the external loading force and the thermal noise may be incorporated into the relevant equations of motion. This modifies the usual Fokker–Planck and Langevin equations, offering a thermodynamically complete formulation of the irreversible dynamics of simple oscillating and rotating engines.",2021.0,2021-08-01,3,97,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0045415ed74f1cb32f12a06a10e4e53d2fa62088

10.1021/acschembio.3c00212,Comprehensive Mechanistic View of the Hydrolysis of Oxadiazole-Based Inhibitors by Histone Deacetylase 6 (HDAC6),"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors used in the clinic typically contain a hydroxamate zinc-binding group (ZBG). However, more recent work has shown that the use of alternative ZBGs, and, in particular, the heterocyclic oxadiazoles, can confer higher isoenzyme selectivity and more favorable ADMET profiles. Herein, we report on the synthesis and biochemical, crystallographic, and computational characterization of a series of oxadiazole-based inhibitors selectively targeting the HDAC6 isoform. Surprisingly, but in line with a very recent finding reported in the literature, a crystal structure of the HDAC6/inhibitor complex revealed that hydrolysis of the oxadiazole ring transforms the parent oxadiazole into an acylhydrazide through a sequence of two hydrolytic steps. An identical cleavage pattern was also observed both in vitro using the purified HDAC6 enzyme as well as in cellular systems. By employing advanced quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and QM calculations, we elucidated the mechanistic details of the two hydrolytic steps to obtain a comprehensive mechanistic view of the double hydrolysis of the oxadiazole ring. This was achieved by fully characterizing the reaction coordinate, including identification of the structures of all intermediates and transition states, together with calculations of their respective activation (free) energies. In addition, we ruled out several (intuitively) competing pathways. The computed data (ΔG‡ ≈ 21 kcal·mol–1 for the rate-determining step of the overall dual hydrolysis) are in very good agreement with the experimentally determined rate constants, which a posteriori supports the proposed reaction mechanism. We also clearly (and quantitatively) explain the role of the −CF3 or −CHF2 substituent on the oxadiazole ring, which is a prerequisite for hydrolysis to occur. Overall, our data provide compelling evidence that the oxadiazole warheads can be efficiently transformed within the active sites of target metallohydrolases to afford reaction products possessing distinct selectivity and inhibition profiles.",2023.0,2023-07-01,9,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c8e0e58a69816da42b34654db8aa577b5aa3a

Through molecular mechanics and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, we explore the conformational landscape of motif V, a conserved loop connecting the active sites for ATP hydrolysis and nucleic acid binding. ATP hydrolysis, initiated by a meta-phosphate group formation, involves the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule activated by Glu286 proton abstraction. Motif V hydrogen bonds to this water via the Gly415 backbone NH group, assisting hydrolysis. Posthydrolysis, free energy is released when the inorganic phosphate moves away from the coordination shell of the magnesium ion, inducing a significant shift in the conformational landscape of motif V to establish a hydrogen bond between the Gly415 NH group and Glu285. According to our simulations, the Zika NS3 helicase acts as a ratchet biological motor with motif V transitions steered by Gly415’s γ-phosphate sensing in the ATPase site.",2023.0,2023-11-03,5,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/008adef08f3e3a6690fca4638d6d8ffd8ed32885

10.32388/6wu1m2,Supersymmetry Via EDM (Electric Dipole Moment),"The article begins by mentioning the accepted correlation between Albert Einstein’s relativistic equations, as well as James Clerk Maxwell’s electromagnetic waves, with the Prandtl-Glauert equations for fluid flow. This equation-free mention nevertheless ends with 180° ΔO = + => - (180 Degree Change in Orientation Equals Positive Becomes Negative). Of course, it also means negative can become positive: 180° ΔO = - => +. Using this article’s new equations, the Electric Dipole Moment is introduced and the charges of the quarks composing a neutron are transformed. EDM’s undetectability is explained from the perspective of a hypothetical someone who doesn’t accept the Big Bang but believes the universe is literally infinite and eternal. Then quantum spin of matter particles is discussed, and extended to astronomy’s black holes, in terms of photons and gravitons not being elementary force-carrying particles but being in possession of EDM. The photon-graviton interaction producing quantum spin is proposed as electromagnetic and gravitational vectors in a figure that might be called “Vector-Tensor-Scalar Geometry”, as well as being related to quaternions plus the Higgs boson and field. Then the article returns to black holes, showing how the inability of light to escape them leads to a 4-dimensional space-time: via binary digits or base 2 mathematics, Mobius bands, figure-8 Klein bottles, and Wick rotation. The electric potential of photons and gravitons is then interpreted not strictly as a neutron-identical Electric Dipole Moment but as a vast array of pulses sharing similarities with modern computers and electronics – the binary digits of the previous sentence. As a consequence of the electric force-carriers bringing them into existence, particles of matter and antimatter are symmetrical with bosons in the sense that every boson or fermion is, at its most fundamental level, composed of binary digits. Imaginary numbers are essential to quantum mechanics, and this article connects the imaginary numbers of Wick rotation to the nature of time. Therefore, the words here are not painting a classical picture of space-time. The 1’s and 0’s of binary digits are compatible with quantum mechanics and may be referred to as the Hidden Variables which Einstein advocated to complete quantum physics, and to give its calculations an exactness which would bring a hidden order to its chaotic randomness and superficial uncertainty. If the universe can be quantized and viewed as comprised of infinitesimal ones and zeros, how could it not obey quantum physics? And if those ones and zeros are all ultimately connected by Quantum Gravity, waves and particles could never be separated but wave-particle duality would rule. To finish, many thanks to Albert Einstein for laying the foundations of this article 105 years ago when he published a paper titled “Do gravitational fields play an essential role in the structure of elementary particles?” Immediately before submission for publication, a few topics were added to this article - dark matter, precession, the Hodge conjecture, and the Riemann hypothesis.

10.3390/e19100513,"""Wave-Packet Reduction"" and the Quantum Character of the Actualization of Potentia","Werner Heisenberg introduced the notion of quantum potentia in order to accommodate the indeterminism associated with quantum measurement. Potentia captures the capacity of the system to be found to possess a property upon a corresponding sharp measurement in which it is actualized. The specific potentiae of the individual system are represented formally by the complex amplitudes in the measurement bases of the eigenstate in which it is prepared. All predictions for future values of system properties can be made by an experimenter using the probabilities which are the squared moduli of these amplitudes that are the diagonal elements of the density matrix description of the pure ensemble to which the system, so prepared, belongs. Heisenberg considered the change of the ensemble attribution following quantum measurement to be analogous to the classical change in Gibbs’ thermodynamics when measurement of the canonical ensemble enables a microcanonical ensemble description. This analogy, presented by Heisenberg as operating at the epistemic level, is analyzed here. It has led some to claim not only that the change of the state in measurement is classical mechanical, bringing its quantum character into question, but also that Heisenberg held this to be the case. Here, these claims are shown to be incorrect, because the analogy concerns the change of ensemble attribution by the experimenter upon learning the result of the measurement, not the actualization of the potentia responsible for the change of the individual system state which—in Heisenberg’s interpretation of quantum mechanics—is objective in nature and independent of the experimenter’s knowledge.",2017.0,2017-09-24,15,16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a71e9aca41f0c15bbc56ff8afec5dde52f9277
10.4314/ajesms.v18i2.6,Students' alternative conceptions in quantum mechanics: The case of one-dimensional potential quantum tunneling,"Quantum mechanics is generally an abstract theory that challenges intuition since it cannot be understood using ordinary experiences. Quantum tunneling is one of the topics which is more counterintuitive and challenges students' conceptual understanding. The study was aimed at investigating if final year undergraduate quantum mechanics students have alternative conceptions regarding quantum tunneling phenomena after a full course of instruction. In this study, students’ alternative conceptions are referred to as any student ideas related to the incorrect belief of scientific principles. Using the deep structured interviews involving 36 students who were registered in a quantum physics course from the University of Malawi, we found that some students hold on to the idea that the energy of a quantum tunneling electron is lost, the wave function graph depicts the physical wave, and the “potential step,” and “barrier” means a physical object/barrier. The study further established that the possible sources of these alternative conceptions emanated from students’ experience with classical tunneling / classical mechanics, quantum mechanics lecturer notes, and previous quantum mechanics lessons. The findings of this study further portray that traditional pedagogy has its limitation in facilitating students' comprehension of quantum tunneling.

10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01542,"Structural, Biochemical, and Computational Characterization of Sulfamides as Bimetallic Peptidase Inhibitors","The sulfonamide function is used extensively as a general building block in various inhibitory scaffolds and, more specifically, as a zinc-binding group (ZBG) of metalloenzyme inhibitors. Here, we provide biochemical, structural, and computational characterization of a metallopeptidase in complex with inhibitors, where the mono- and bisubstituted sulfamide functions are designed to directly engage zinc ions of a bimetallic enzyme site. Structural data showed that while monosubstituted sulfamides coordinate active-site zinc ions via the free negatively charged amino group in a canonical manner, their bisubstituted counterparts adopt an atypical binding pattern divergent from expected positioning of corresponding tetrahedral reaction intermediates. Accompanying quantum mechanics calculations revealed that electroneutrality of the sulfamide function is a major factor contributing to the markedly lower potency of bisubstituted compounds by considerably lowering their interaction energy with the enzyme. Overall, while bisubstituted uncharged sulfamide functions can bolster favorable pharmacological properties of a given inhibitor, their use as ZBGs in metalloenzyme inhibitors might be less advantageous due to their suboptimal metal–ligand properties.",2024.0,2024-01-15,0,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00aee9f0e803967bf79ae76acbb140bdd2763439

10.1021/jacs.3c00377,How the pH Controls Photoprotection in the Light-Harvesting Complex of Mosses,"In response to varying light conditions, light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) switch from a light-harvesting state to a quenched state to protect the photosynthetic organism from excessive light irradiation in a strategy known as nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). NPQ is activated by an acidification of the thylakoid lumen, which is sensed directly or indirectly by the LHC, resulting in a conformational change of the complex that leads to the quenched state. The conformational changes responsible for NPQ activation and their connection to specific quenching mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we investigate the pH-triggered conformational changes in the light-harvesting complex stress-related (LHCSR) of mosses. By combining constant-pH molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling techniques, we find that the pH sensitivity of the complex is driven by the coupled protonation of three residues modulating the conformation of the short amphipathic helix placed at the lumen side of the embedding membrane. Combining these results with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, we show that the quenching mechanism sensitive to the pH goes through a charge-transfer between a carotenoid and an excited chlorophyll, which is controlled by the protein conformation.",2023.0,2023-03-24,9,77,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b57796a4d94d242b0b73d6a17a3af3dc894cae

10.33140/atcp.03.01.02,Revolution of Charged Particles in a Central Field of Attraction with Emission of Radiation,"A particle of mass nm, carrying the electronic charge -e, revolves in an orbit through angle ψ at distances nr from a center of force
of attraction, with angular momenta nL perpendicular to the orbital plane, where n is an integer greater than 0, m the electronic
mass and r1 is the radius of the first circular orbit. The equation of motion of the nth orbit of revolution is derived, revealing
that an excited particle revolves in an unclosed elliptic orbit, with emission of radiation at the frequency of revolution, before
settling down, after many cycles of ψ, in a stable circular orbit. In unipolar revolution, a radiating particle settles in a circular
orbit of radius nr1 round a positively charged nucleus. In bipolar revolution, two radiating particles of the same mass nm and
charges e and –e, settle in a circular stable orbit of radius ns1 round a common center of mass, where s1 is the radius of the first
orbit. Discrete masses nm and angular momenta nL lead to quantization of the orbits outside Bohr’s quantum mechanics. The
frequency of radiation in the bipolar revolution is found to be in conformity with the Balmer-Rydberg formula for the spectral
lines of radiation from the atom hydrogen gas. There is a spread in frequency of emitted radiation, the frequency in the final
circle being the highest, which might explain hydrogen fine structure, as observed with a diffraction grating of high resolution.
The unipolar revolution is identified with the solid or liquid state of hydrogen and bipolar revolution with the gas state.",2020.0,2020-02-01,0,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00cc34ae7bf8be7ccce44c42745266dda231740a

In this paper, it is shown that multiple technical obstacles encountered in such a context can be circumvented via just a mild amendment of the so-called Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation–expansion approach. In particular, the quasi-Hermitian formalism characterized by an enhancement of flexibility is shown to remain mathematically tractable while, on the phenomenological side, opening several new model-building horizons. It is emphasized that they include, i.a., the study of generic random perturbations and/or of multiple specific non-Hermitian toy models.

10.3390/sym16020174,Unified Supersymmetric Description of Shape-Invariant Potentials within and beyond the Natanzon Class,"The transformations of supersymmetric quantum mechanics are discussed within a formalism that employs a six-parameter function, from which the superpotential and the supersymmetric partner potentials V−(x) and V+(x) are constructed in a general form. By specific choice of the parameters, V−(x) and V+(x) are matched with the general form of PI class potentials and their rationally extended versions. The choice of the parameters also determines which of the four possible SUSY transformations Ti, i=1,…4 is in effect. After this general discussion, the formulae are specified to the three members of this potential class, the Scarf I, Scarf II and generalized Pöschl–Teller potentials. Due to the different domains of definition and their consequences on the boundary conditions, the results turn out to be rather diverse for the three potentials, while the mathematical formalism and the network of the potentials interconnected by the SUSYQM transformations still remains common to a large extent. The general framework allows a unified and consistent interpretation of earlier isolated findings.

10.3390/e23020210,Extending Quantum Probability from Real Axis to Complex Plane,"Probability is an important question in the ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics. It has been discussed in some trajectory interpretations such as Bohmian mechanics and stochastic mechanics. New questions arise when the probability domain extends to the complex space, including the generation of complex trajectory, the definition of the complex probability, and the relation of the complex probability to the quantum probability. The complex treatment proposed in this article applies the optimal quantum guidance law to derive the stochastic differential equation governing a particle’s random motion in the complex plane. The probability distribution ρc(t,x,y) of the particle’s position over the complex plane z=x+iy is formed by an ensemble of the complex quantum random trajectories, which are solved from the complex stochastic differential equation. Meanwhile, the probability distribution ρc(t,x,y) is verified by the solution of the complex Fokker–Planck equation. It is shown that quantum probability |Ψ|2 and classical probability can be integrated under the framework of complex probability ρc(t,x,y), such that they can both be derived from ρc(t,x,y) by different statistical ways of collecting spatial points.",2020.0,2020-12-29,9,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014d2ab5ae70a5b366b759c4804e4ff2ee0b575a

10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00654,"Integration of Quantum Chemistry, Statistical Mechanics, and Artificial Intelligence for Computational Spectroscopy: The UV–Vis Spectrum of TEMPO Radical in Different Solvents","The ongoing integration of quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and artificial intelligence is paving the route toward more effective and accurate strategies for the investigation of the spectroscopic properties of medium-to-large size chromophores in condensed phases. In this context we are developing a novel workflow aimed at improving the generality, reliability, and ease of use of the available computational tools. In this paper we report our latest developments with specific reference to unsupervised atomistic simulations employing non periodic boundary conditions (NPBC) followed by clustering of the trajectories employing optimized feature spaces. Next accurate variational computations are performed for a representative point of each cluster, whereas intracluster fluctuations are taken into account by a cheap yet reliable perturbative approach. A number of methodological improvements have been introduced including, e.g., more realistic reaction field effects at the outer boundary of the simulation sphere, automatic definition of the feature space by continuous perception of solute–solvent interactions, full account of polarization and charge transfer in the first solvation shell, and inclusion of vibronic contributions. After its validation, this new approach has been applied to the challenging case of solvatochromic effects on the UV–vis spectra of a prototypical nitroxide radical (TEMPO) in different solvents. The reliability, effectiveness, and robustness of the new platform is demonstrated by the remarkable agreement with experiment of the results obtained through an unsupervised approach characterized by a strongly reduced computational cost as compared to that of conventional quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics models without any accuracy reduction.",2022.0,2022-09-27,18,67,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0165e422d3dab84c1e2d26f50629bd05a3035dca

This ‘relational approach to time’, in which the system’s environment provides a temporal reference, does not only provide insight into foundational issues of physics, but holds the potential for a deeper theoretical understanding as it intimately links statics and dynamics. Reinforcing the significance of this connection, we demonstrate, based on recent progress (Gemsheim and Rost 2023 Phys. Rev. Lett. 131 140202), the role of emergent time as a vital link between time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. We calculate first order contributions, which are often the most significant, and discuss the issue of degenerate spectra.

10.1021/acs.jpca.4c02851,Dissociation Energies via Embedding Techniques,"Due to the large number of interactions, evaluating interaction energies for large or periodic systems results in time-consuming calculations. Prime examples are liquids, adsorbates, and molecular crystals. Thus, there is a high demand for a cheap but still accurate method to determine interaction energies and gradients. One approach to counteract the computational cost is to fragment a large cluster into smaller subsystems, sometimes called many-body expansion, with the fragments being molecules or parts thereof. These subsystems can then be embedded into larger entities, representing the bigger system. In this work, we test several subsystem approaches and explore their limits and behaviors, determined by calculations of trimer interaction energies. The methods presented here encompass mechanical embedding, point charges, polarizable embedding, polarizable density embedding, and density embedding. We evaluate nonembedded fragmentation, QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics), and QM/QM (quantum mechanics/quantum mechanics) embedding theories. Finally, we make use of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory utilizing density functional theory for the monomers to interpret the results. Depending on the strength of the interaction, different embedding methods and schemes prove favorable to accurately describe a system. The embedding approaches presented here are able to decrease the interaction energy errors with respect to full system calculations by a factor of up to 20 in comparison to simple/unembedded approaches, leading to errors below 0.1 kJ/mol.",2024.0,2024-10-15,0,79,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01adf5936ef1501e90b489874d99e412eefbc56f

10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b01512,Photophysics of the LOV-Based Fluorescent Protein Variant iLOV-Q489K Determined by Simulation and Experiment.,"Light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) based fluorescent proteins (FPs) represent a promising alternative to fluorescent reporters of the green fluorescent protein family. For certain applications like multicolor imaging or the design of FRET-based biosensors, the generation of spectrally shifted LOV-based FPs would be required. In a recent theoretical study ( Khrenova J. Phys. Chem. B 2015 , 119 ( 16 ), pp 5176 - 5183 ), the photophysical properties of a variant of the LOV-based fluorescent protein iLOV were predicted using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches. The variant contained a lysine residue at the position of a highly conserved glutamine residue (Q489K), which directly interacts with the O4 and N5 atom of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore. On the basis of QM/MM calculations, iLOV-Q489K was suggested to possess substantially red-shifted absorption and fluorescence-emission maxima with respect to parental iLOV. Here, we describe the experimental characterization of this variant, which, surprisingly contrary to the theoretical prediction, shows blue-shifted absorption and fluorescence-emission maxima. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and QM/MM calculations, the molecular basis for the contradictory theoretical and experimental results is presented. Essentially, our computational analysis suggests that, in the Q489K variant, two possible side-chain conformers exist: (i) a least populated conformer K489in forming a hydrogen bond with the O4 atom of FMN chromophore and (ii) a most populated conformer K489out with the side-chain amino group flipped away from the FMN chromophore forming a new hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of G487. QM/MM calculated spectra of the K489out conformer are blue-shifted compared to the calculated spectra of parental iLOV, which is in accordance with experimental data. This suggests that the change in the conformation of K489 from K498in to K489out accounts for the change in the direction of the spectral shift from red to blue, thus reconciling theory and experiment.",2016.0,2016-03-29,39,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01d702d469ab97b7d15cc371ff64015bb848ee26

10.3390/e22111273,Effective Number Theory: Counting the Identities of a Quantum State,"Quantum physics frequently involves a need to count the states, subspaces, measurement outcomes, and other elements of quantum dynamics. However, with quantum mechanics assigning probabilities to such objects, it is often desirable to work with the notion of a “total” that takes into account their varied relevance. For example, such an effective count of position states available to a lattice electron could characterize its localization properties. Similarly, the effective total of outcomes in the measurement step of a quantum computation relates to the efficiency of the quantum algorithm. Despite a broad need for effective counting, a well-founded prescription has not been formulated. Instead, the assignments that do not respect the measure-like nature of the concept, such as versions of the participation number or exponentiated entropies, are used in some areas. Here, we develop the additive theory of effective number functions (ENFs), namely functions assigning consistent totals to collections of objects endowed with probability weights. Our analysis reveals the existence of a minimal total, realized by the unique ENF, which leads to effective counting with absolute meaning. Touching upon the nature of the measure, our results may find applications not only in quantum physics, but also in other quantitative sciences.",2020.0,2020-11-01,13,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0202fb4ed16e09e6d868e6be3aecc79a739d3acb

10.1371/journal.pone.0169910,Predicting the Metabolic Sites by Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase on Drug Molecules Using SVM Classification on Computed Quantum Mechanics and Circular Fingerprints Molecular Descriptors,"As an important enzyme in Phase I drug metabolism, the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) also metabolizes some xenobiotics with soft nucleophiles. The site of metabolism (SOM) on a molecule is the site where the metabolic reaction is exerted by an enzyme. Accurate prediction of SOMs on drug molecules will assist the search for drug leads during the optimization process. Here, some quantum mechanics features such as the condensed Fukui function and attributes from circular fingerprints (called Molprint2D) are computed and classified using the support vector machine (SVM) for predicting some potential SOMs on a series of drugs that can be metabolized by FMO enzymes. The condensed Fukui function fA− representing the nucleophilicity of central atom A and the attributes from circular fingerprints accounting the influence of neighbors on the central atom. The total number of FMO substrates and non-substrates collected in the study is 85 and they are equally divided into the training and test sets with each carrying roughly the same number of potential SOMs. However, only N-oxidation and S-oxidation features were considered in the prediction since the available C-oxidation data was scarce.

10.3390/e26050411,Does Quantum Mechanics Require “Conspiracy”?,"Quantum states containing records of incompatible outcomes of quantum measurements are valid states in the tensor-product Hilbert space. Since they contain false records, they conflict with the Born rule and with our observations. I show that excluding them requires a fine-tuning to an extremely restricted subspace of the Hilbert space that seems “conspiratorial”, in the sense that (1) it seems to depend on future events that involve records (including measurement settings) and on the dynamical law (normally thought to be independent of the initial conditions), and (2) it violates Statistical Independence, even when it is valid in the context of Bell’s theorem. To solve the puzzle, I build a model in which, by changing the dynamical law, the same initial conditions can lead to different histories in which the validity of records is relative to the new dynamical law. This relative validity of the records may restore causality, but the initial conditions still must depend, at least partially, on the dynamical law. While violations of Statistical Independence are often seen as non-scientific, they turn out to be needed to ensure the validity of records and our own memories and, by this, of science itself. A Past Hypothesis is needed to ensure the existence of records and turns out to require violations of Statistical Independence. It is not excluded that its explanation, still unknown, ensures such violations in the way needed by local interpretations of quantum mechanics. I suggest that an as-yet unknown law or superselection rule may restrict the full tensor-product Hilbert space to the very special subspace required by the validity of records and the Past Hypothesis.",2022.0,2022-09-27,8,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0250065f38fee2163d6032ea851a7a1f5f1dec61

10.56367/oag-037-10539,The Standard Model (SM) and the goal of force unification,"
 
 The unification of gravitational, Strong and Weak Forces has been a long-sought goal [1-3]. In general, force unification refers to the idea that it is possible to view all of the forces of nature as manifestations of one single, all-encompassing force. Today, within the context of the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles, [7] scientists seek to unify Gravity with the Strong force under a Grand Unified Theory which binds quarks together and is responsible for the stability of atomic nuclei. These efforts have not been successful yet, most likely because the SM neglects neutrinos [8,9], gravity [4], special relativity [10] and quantum mechanics [11].

10.3390/e20060466,The Gibbs Paradox and Particle Individuality,"A consensus seems to have developed that the Gibbs paradox in classical thermodynamics (the discontinuous drop in the entropy of mixing when the mixed gases become equal to each other) is unmysterious: in any actual situation, two gases can be separated or not, and the associated harmless discontinuity from “yes” to “no” is responsible for the discontinuity. By contrast, the Gibbs paradox in statistical physics continues to attract attention. Here, the problem is that standard calculations in statistical mechanics predict a non-vanishing value of the entropy of mixing even when two gases of the same kind are mixed, in conflict with thermodynamic predictions. This version of the Gibbs paradox is often seen as a sign that there is something fundamentally wrong with either the traditional expression S=klnW or with the way W is calculated. It is the aim of this article to review the situation from the orthodox (as opposed to information theoretic) standpoint. We demonstrate how the standard formalism is not only fully capable of dealing with the paradox, but also provides an intuitively clear picture of the relevant physical mechanisms. In particular, we pay attention to the explanatory relevance of the existence of particle trajectories in the classical context. We also discuss how the paradox survives the transition to quantum mechanics, in spite of the symmetrization postulates.",2018.0,2018-06-01,11,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02922c86b5f5d4506fe7d0f6c9f01ffde9df32cc

In this paper, the robustness of entanglement of Dicke–W and Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) mixed states under different mixing ratios is calculated using the entanglement witness method. The robustnesses of entanglement of Dicke–W and GHZ mixed states are different when the probability ratio of Dicke to W is greater than 32 and less than 32. For the probability of Dicke and W states greater than or equal to 32, we study the robustness of entanglement of Dicke and GHZ mixed states and analyze and calculate their upper and lower bounds. For the probability of Dicke and W states less than 32, we take the equal probability ratio of Dicke and W states as an example and calculate and analyze the upper and lower bounds of their robustness of entanglement in detail.",2024.0,2024-09-01,0,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/029c25864dcfb3decf78df06842de60a671236f9

10.3390/universe6110194,Making a Quantum Universe: Symmetry and Gravity,"So far, none of attempts to quantize gravity has led to a satisfactory model that not only describe gravity in the realm of a quantum world, but also its relation to elementary particles and other fundamental forces. Here, we outline the preliminary results for a model of quantum universe, in which gravity is fundamentally and by construction quantic. The model is based on three well motivated assumptions with compelling observational and theoretical evidence: quantum mechanics is valid at all scales; quantum systems are described by their symmetries; universe has infinite independent degrees of freedom. The last assumption means that the Hilbert space of the Universe has SU(N→∞)≅areapreservingDiff.(S2) symmetry, which is parameterized by two angular variables. We show that, in the absence of a background spacetime, this Universe is trivial and static. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations break the symmetry and divide the Universe to subsystems. When a subsystem is singled out as reference—observer—and another as clock, two more continuous parameters arise, which can be interpreted as distance and time. We identify the classical spacetime with parameter space of the Hilbert space of the Universe. Therefore, its quantization is meaningless. In this view, the Einstein equation presents the projection of quantum dynamics in the Hilbert space into its parameter space. Finite dimensional symmetries of elementary particles emerge as a consequence of symmetry breaking when the Universe is divided to subsystems/particles, without having any implication for the infinite dimensional symmetry and its associated interaction-percived as gravity. This explains why gravity is a universal force.",2020.0,2020-09-07,7,131,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02caa916a4f9d8be019927c36e6835239192da05

10.1017/S1478951524001202,Measuring compassion in end-of-life cancer patients: The Italian validation of the Sinclair Compassion Questionnaire (SCQit).,"OBJECTIVES
Compassion is acknowledged as a key component of high-quality palliative care, producing positive outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers. The development of the Sinclair Compassion Questionnaire (SCQ) fulfilled the need for a valid and reliable tool to measure patients' experience of compassion. To validate the Italian version of the SCQ and to evaluate its psychometric properties in a sample of cancer patients with a life expectancy of less than 4 months.


METHODS
Cronbach's alpha estimates were computed to evaluate the internal reliability. Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and Item Response Theory analyses were performed to assess the validity of the construct. Divergent validity was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Treatment Satisfaction-Patient Satisfaction, the revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and the Trust in Oncologist Scale-Short Form. Data were collected from 131 patients recruited in either a hospital or a hospice setting.


RESULTS
The analyses confirmed the single factor structure of SCQit, with Confirmatory Factor Analysis factor loadings ranging between 0.81 and 0.92 and satisfactory internal reliability. Hospital setting and high diagnosis/prognosis awareness were associated with significantly lower SCQit scores, whereas practicing a religious faith was associated with greater experiences of compassion.


SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS
The Italian version of the SCQ (SCit) is a valid and reliable measure of patient-reported compassion. The SCQit can be used in clinical practice and research to measure the compassion experiences of terminally ill cancer patients and to evaluate the effectiveness of training to promote compassionate care in healthcare professionals.",2024.0,2024-10-15,0,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00002b17b050f7e68b5b77e5ccb2d8e490adf13b

We aimed to determine the effects of hormones on piRNA expression in breast and prostate cancer. High viability and a decrease in adhesion were observed at the concentrations of the highest proliferation. Furthermore, an increase in adhesion was also observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. After hormone treatment, while piR-651 expression had increased both breast and prostate cancer cell lines, piR-823 expressions increased in prostate cancer cell lines and only in the breast cancer cell line which was malignant. Thus, it was determined that piR-823 might show different expressions in different type of cancers.",2016.0,2016-07-14,46,71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00003014da84880c460d0d0b6b72aa0451ae4600

10.4061/2011/167046,"Effects of the Demethylating Agent, 5-Azacytidine, on Expression of the Kallikrein-Kinin Genes in Carcinoma Cells of the Lung and Pleura","Tissue kallikrein (KLK1) and plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) may regulate the growth and proliferation of tumours of the lung and pleura, through the generation of kinin peptides that signal through the kinin B1 (BDKRB1) and B2 (BDKRB2) receptors. The development and progression of cancer results from genetic mutations, as well as epigenetic changes that include methylation of DNA at CpG islands. The aim of this study was to assess whether expression of the kallikrein-kinin genes in lung cancer and mesothelioma cells is regulated by DNA methylation. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunocytochemistry showed differences in the basal expression of the kallikrein-kinin genes and proteins in lung carcinoma and mesothelioma cells, compared with non-malignant lung epithelial and mesothelial cells, respectively. Following treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), KLKB1 mRNA expression was consistently increased in both lung carcinoma and mesothelioma cells, whereas KLK1, BDKRB1 and BDKRB2 mRNA expression was decreased or unchanged. Increased expression of KLKB1 after 5-AZA treatment suggests it may function as a tumour suppressor gene in cancers of the lung and pleura. Studies on DNA methylation of the kallikrein-kinin genes will enhance understanding of their role in carcinogenesis and provide insights into the importance of kallikreins as tumour biomarkers.",2011.0,2011-09-04,15,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000148329845d8748d8eaa0fca1cf38d9525d1d0

10.4048/jbc.2017.20.4.368,Treatment Patterns and Outcomes in Elderly Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Multicenter Retrospective Study,"Purpose Currently, there is little information regarding optimal treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in elderly patients. In this retrospective study, we examined a cohort of elderly patients with MBC receiving a range of treatments, in terms of demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes. Methods Patients aged 65 years and older, and diagnosed with MBC between 2003 and 2015, were identified from the databases of three academic hospitals in South Korea. A total of 161 cases were eligible for inclusion. We assessed clinicopathologic features, treatment patterns, and outcomes, using the available electronic medical records. Based on age at MBC diagnosis, patients were divided into three groups: 65 to 69, 70 to 74, and ≥75 years. Results Most patients had received active treatment according to biologic subtype as in younger patients, although frequent dose modifications were observed during chemotherapy. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 30.3 months; age (≥70 years), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (≥2), triple-negative cancer, and number of metastatic sites (≥2) were significant poor prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analyses. All types of systemic treatments according to biologic subtype conferred more prolonged OS in patients receiving treatment. Patients aged ≥75 years were more likely to have a poor ECOG PS and advanced comorbidity, and tended to receive less intensive treatments compared to the other age groups. Conclusion Elderly patients with MBC should not be excluded from receiving standard treatments prescribed for younger patients. Future research plans for elderly patients, especially aged ≥75 years with breast cancer, should include a geriatric assessment for identifying individuals at risk for treatment-related toxicity. Overall, this analysis will provide a better understanding of this population and help guide clinical care in real-world practice.",2017.0,2017-12-01,13,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000192389586640fd0395d9471a27040bff23592
10.3389/fonc.2013.00207,A Proposal for a Targeted Screening Program for Renal Cancer,"Renal cancer kills over 26,000 people per year in Europe and 13,000 in the United States (1, 2). If identified before metastatic spread, kidney cancer is usually surgically curable (3), whereas the median survival with disseminated cancer is only 2 years (4). Turney et al. proposed in 2006 that a screening program using ultrasound could have a major impact on renal cancer mortality (5). The suggestion was criticized on the basis that the natural history of renal cancer was poorly understood, and that the treatment of renal masses would not be of net benefit in older populations (6). In the past 7 years, however, the natural history and epidemiology of renal cancer have become much clearer. Moreover, nephron-sparing surgery and minimally invasive ablation are now better established (7), changing the cost-benefit ratio for treatment in older populations. These developments mean that a targeted renal cancer screening program is now a real option. The evidence for such a screening program is presented in three parts: first, an update on the natural history and risk factors; second, a calculation of the benefits and harms of screening in different populations, and third, lessons from other cancer screening programs. Finally, a clinical algorithm to aid with screening and treatment choices is presented.",2013.0,2013-08-20,14,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001cb74f43d157f9a2d2aa59b044d2625469ebe
10.3389/fgene.2014.00150,Characterization of HPV DNA methylation of contiguous CpG sites by bisulfite treatment and massively parallel sequencing—the FRAGMENT approach,"Invasive cervix cancer (ICC) is the third most common malignant tumor in women and human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) causes more than 50% of ICC. DNA methylation is a covalent modification predominantly occurring at CpG dinucleotides and increased methylation across the HPV16 genome is strongly associated with ICC development. Next generation (Next Gen) sequencing has been proposed as a novel approach to determine DNA methylation. However, utilization of this method to survey CpG methylation in the HPV16 genome is not well described. Moreover, it provides additional information on methylation “haplotypes.” In the current study, we chose 12 random samples, amplified multiple segments in the HPV16 bisulfite treated genome with specific barcodes, inspected the methylation ratio at 31 CpG sites for all samples using Illumina sequencing, and compared the results with quantitative pyrosequencing. Most of the CpG sites were highly consistent between the two approaches (overall correlation, r = 0.92), thus verifying that Next Gen sequencing is an accurate and convenient method to survey HPV16 methylation and thus can be used in clinical samples for risk assessment. Moreover, the CpG methylation patterns (methylation haplotypes) in single molecules identified an excess of complete-and non-methylated molecules and a substantial amount of partial-methylated ones, thus indicating a complex dynamic for the mechanisms of HPV16 CpG methylation. In summary, the advantages of Next Gen sequencing compared to pyrosequencing for HPV genome methylation analyses include higher throughput, increased resolution, and improved efficiency of time and resources.",2014.0,2014-03-21,10,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001ddeb4808f9a6f8f6e7e92e282de699f897cd

Methods  HBCR abstracts data from electronic medical records. Trained cancer registry staff abstracts cases in standard pro forma. Dual primary was coded as per the International Agency for Research on Cancer rule and was rechecked by the pathologist. Statistical Analysis  Data about multiple primary was entered and documented in an Excel sheet. Time interval was calculated by subtracting the date of diagnosis for second primary and first primary. Results  A total of 6,933 cases were registered, 45 cases are dual primary (26 females, 19 males) of which 64.4% are synchronous and 35.6% metachronous cases. Seventy-nine percent received cancer-directed treatment for synchronous and 87% for metachronous. The most common sites of the primary tumor were breast (33%), head and neck (22.2%), gynecological sites (11%), prostate (9%), esophagus (4%), and remaining other tumors (20.8%). Most common sites for second malignancies were gastrointestinal (GI) tract (31%), gynecological sites (18%), head and neck (16%), hematological malignancies (7%), soft tissue sarcoma (4%), breast (2%), and other sites (22%). Conclusion  More than 70% of cases of primary tumors were in breast, head and neck, gynecological, and prostate. Of these, more than 60% of the second malignancy was found in the GI tract, gynecological, and head and neck sites. Around two-thirds of dual tumors are synchronous. Breast cancer cases have higher incidence of second malignancy. Regular follow-up is necessary to assess the survival of the second primary.",2022.0,2022-12-26,0,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0002062fa046b68f242275adb9249af2fa7d462e

We hypothesized the negation of off-target toxicity of anthracyclines (e.g., Doxorubicin) by delivering Doxorubicin on magneto-electric silica nanoparticles (Dox-MagSiNs) to cancer cells. Dox-MagSiNs were completely biocompatible with all cell types and are therapeutically inert till the release of Doxorubicin from the MagSiNs at the cancer cells location. The MagSiNs themselves are comprised of biocompatible components with a magnetostrictive cobalt ferrite core (4–6 nm) surrounded by a piezoelectric fused silica shell of 1.5 nm to 2 nm thickness. The MagSiNs possess T2-MRI contrast properties on par with RESOVIST™ due to their cobalt ferrite core. Additionally, the silica shell surrounding the core was volume loaded with green or red fluorophores to fluorescently track the MagSiNs in vitro. This makes the MagSiNs a suitable candidate for trackable, drug nanocarriers. We used metastatic triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDAMB231), ovarian cancer cells (A2780), and prostate cancer cells (PC3) as our model cancer cell lines. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used as control cell lines to represent blood-vessel cells that suffer from the systemic toxicity of Doxorubicin. In the presence of an external magnetic field that is 300× times lower than an MRI field, we successfully nanoporated the cancer cells, then triggered the release of 500 nM of doxorubicin from Dox-MagSiNs to successfully kill >50% PC3, >50% A2780 cells, and killed 125% more MDAMB231 cells than free Dox.HCl. In control HUVECs, the Dox-MagSiNs did not nanoporate into the HUVECS and did not exhibited any cytotoxicity at all when there was no triggered release of Dox.HCl. Currently, the major advantages of our approach are, (i) the MagSiNs are biocompatible in vitro and in vivo; (ii) the label-free nanoporation of Dox-MagSiNs into cancer cells and not the model blood vessel cell line; (iii) the complete cancellation of the cytotoxicity of Doxorubicin in the Dox-MagSiNs form; (iv) the clinical impact of such a nanocarrier will be that it will be possible to increase the current upper limit for cumulative-dosages of anthracyclines through multiple dosing, which in turn will improve the anti-cancer efficacy of anthracyclines.",2022.0,2022-09-30,4,67,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0002417cef6146534eb1697e154a9a2be4cd1b46

Materials and Methods: In order to uncover direct BRD4-regulated targets in MCL, we performed integrated analysis using the pathway database and the results of both gene-expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation with parallel sequencing for BRD4. Results: Treatment with BRD4 inhibitor I-BET151 exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in MCL cell lines. BRD4 was found to directly regulate series of genes involved in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, including B-cell linker (BLNK), paired box 5 (PAX5), and IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (IKZF3), and several oncogenes, such as MYB. Indeed, the combinatory inhibition of BCR pathway and IKZF showed an additive antitumor effect.

10.7150/IJMS.3.1,Polysaccharides from the root of Angelica sinensis protect bone marrow and gastrointestinal tissues against the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in mice,"Cyclophosphamide (CY) is a cytostatic agent that produces systemic toxicity especially on cells with high proliferative capacity, while polysaccharides from Angelica sinensis (AP) have been shown to increase the turnover of gastrointestinal mucosal and hemopoietic stem cells. It is not known whether AP has an effect on CY-induced cytotoxicity on bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we assessed the protective actions of AP on CY-induced leukopenia and proliferative arrest in the gastroduodenal mucosa in mice. Subcutaneous injection of CY (200 mg/kg) provoked dramatic decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count and number of blood vessels and proliferating cells in both the gastric and duodenal mucosae. Subcutaneous injection of AP significantly promoted the recovery from leukopenia and increased number of blood vessels and proliferating cells in both the gastric and duodenal tissues. Western blotting revealed that CY significantly down-regulated the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), c-Myc and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in gastric mucosae but had no effect on epidermal growth factor (EGF) expression. AP also reversed the dampening effect of CY on VEGF expression in the gastric mucosa. These data suggest that AP is a cytoprotective agent which can protect against the cytotoxicity of CY on hematopoietic and gastrointestinal tissues when the polysaccharide is co-administered with CY in cancer patients during treatment regimen.",2006.0,2006-01-01,49,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00036a3493967932ac256f38c0c2419415f04feb

Biomarkers are urgently required for early diagnosis and better prognostic classification, which is essential for risk stratification and optimizing treatment strategies in clinical settings. By analyzing the data extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas database using R, the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 antisense (BACE1-AS) was discovered to have both high diagnostic and prognostic values in liver cancer, which could serve as a promising biomarker in clinical settings. Precisely, lncRNA BACE1-AS is significantly overexpressed in liver cancer and its levels vary within different subgroups, suggesting its tumorigenic role. Furthermore, higher BACE1-AS predicts poorer overall survival and relapse-free survival outcomes. Overall, the present study demonstrated that BACE1-AS may be involved in liver cancer progression and could serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prognostic evaluation.",2020.0,2020-09-08,10,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0003719a5e3d0afd5ad519f3d58553cb910beff0

Case report In this case, we aimed to present the safety and effectiveness of lorlatinib use in a patient diagnosed with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC who underwent hemodialysis 3 days a week. Management & Outcome A 76-year-old female patient has been undergoing regular hemodialysis for about 2 years. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was taken due to headache and a mass was detected. She was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma as a result of excisional biopsy. Positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) showed a mass in the hilar region of the left lung and multiple lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum. In February 2023, 100 mg lorlatinib was started daily. There was no significant regression in PET-CT and no brain MRI residue during follow-up. The patient has been continuing lorlatinib for approximately 1 year with almost complete response, with no side effects other than hypercholesterolemia. Discussion We presented our experience using lorlatinib in a patient with metastatic ALK + NSCLC undergoing hemodialysis. Although the dosage of lorlatinib in hemodialysis patients is still controversial, our case report indicates that 100 mg lorlatinib was safe in this patient.",2024.0,2024-08-14,0,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00049615efee2a9e6b0c74f605d4aae3a663495d

10.21037/tlcr-22-596,"Activity of osimertinib in a patient with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer harboring HER2 exon 19, p.L755P mutation: case report","Background Recurrent in-frame insertions within exon 20 causing duplication of amino acids Tyrosine-Valine-Methionine-Alanine (YVMA) represent 80% of all HER2 alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies and HER2 directed antibody-drug conjugates have been evaluated in patients with HER2 mutated NSCLC. Limited data are available regarding the activity of these agents in exon 19 alterations. Osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI, has been found in pre-clinical studies to decrease growth of NSCLC with HER2 exon 19 aberrations. Case Description A 68-year-old female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and minimal smoking was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC. Next generation sequencing on tumor tissue demonstrated an ERBB2 exon 19 c.2262_2264delinsTCC, p.(L755P) mutation. After five lines of treatment that included chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy and investigational agents the patient’s disease was progressing. At this time her functional status remained good, therefore clinical trials were explored however, none were available. Based on findings from pre-clinical studies, the patient was commenced on osimertinib 80 mg OD and achieved a partial response (PR) according to RESIST criteria both intra- and extracranially. Conclusions This is the first report to our knowledge to demonstrate activity of osimertinib in a patient with NSCLC harboring HER2 exon 19, p.L755P mutation resulting in intra- and extracranial response. In the future, osimertinib could become a targeted treatment for patients harboring exon19 ERBB2 point mutations.",2023.0,2023-01-01,1,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004ce245b5ac8068e80e21916d518ff0c804056

10.1093/hmg/ddac268,TFIIH mutations can impact on translational fidelity of the ribosome,"Abstract TFIIH is a complex essential for transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II, DNA repair of UV-lesions and transcription of rRNA by RNA polymerase I. Mutations in TFIIH cause the cancer prone DNA-repair disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and the developmental and premature aging disorders trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and Cockayne syndrome. A total of 50% of the TTD cases are caused by TFIIH mutations. Using TFIIH mutant patient cells from TTD and XP subjects we can show that the stress-sensitivity of the proteome is reduced in TTD, but not in XP. Using three different methods to investigate the accuracy of protein synthesis by the ribosome, we demonstrate that translational fidelity of the ribosomes of TTD, but not XP cells, is decreased. The process of ribosomal synthesis and maturation is affected in TTD cells and can lead to instable ribosomes. Isolated ribosomes from TTD patients show an elevated error rate when challenged with oxidized mRNA, explaining the oxidative hypersensitivity of TTD cells. Treatment of TTD cells with N-acetyl cysteine normalized the increased translational error-rate and restored translational fidelity. Here we describe a pathomechanism that might be relevant for our understanding of impaired development and aging-associated neurodegeneration.",2022.0,2022-10-29,6,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004dfc4937febb70fc5e8a9b2fc2cd8c85b7dd6
10.3390/ijms22010197,CKAP2L Knockdown Exerts Antitumor Effects by Increasing miR-4496 in Glioblastoma Cell Lines,"Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of the central nervous system malignancy glioma, overall survival remains poor. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 2-like (CKAP2L), which plays key roles in neural progenitor cell division, has also been linked to poor prognosis in lung cancer. In the present study, we investigated the role of CKAP2L in glioma. From bioinformatics analyses of datasets from The Cancer Gene Atlas and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas, we found that CKAP2L expression correlates with tumor grade and overall survival. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that MITOTIC_SPINDLE, G2M_CHECKPOINT, and E2F_TARGETS are crucially enriched phenotypes associated with high CKAP2L expression. Using U87MG, U118MG, and LNZ308 human glioma cells, we confirmed that CKAP2L knockdown with siCKAP2L inhibits glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Interestingly, CKAP2L knockdown also induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, which is consistent with the GSEA finding. Finally, we observed that CKAP2L knockdown led to significant increases in miR-4496. Treating cells with exogenous miR-4496 mimicked the effect of CKAP2L knockdown, and the effects of CKAP2L knockdown could be suppressed by miR-4496 inhibition. These findings suggest that CKAP2L is a vital regulator of miR-4496 activity and that CKAP2L is a potentially useful prognostic marker in glioma.",2020.0,2020-12-27,13,53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004e186b86b9ca862fa1155f044b6285ae77e1a

A potential problem in dealing with those conditions is the risk of misdiagnosing the rare patient who has a neoplastic disease involving the orofacial tissues. The intent of this article was to review the literature and report a case of a paraphayngeal malignant tumorwhich presented with typical signs and symptoms of a temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Summary and Conclusion: This case report and the reviewed articles demonstrated that TMDs should not be the only diagnostic category considered in patients with mandibular dysfunction and facial pain. Symptoms caused by a malignant tumour in the head and neck regions may be masked by or mistaken as a concurrent TMD and thus overlooked for a considerable amount of time. Earlier recognition of head and neck cancer by the clinician, with earlier treatment, is essential for improving the generally poor five-year survival rate of this disease. A narrow ‘TMDoriented’ approach may have fatal consequences on the patient life, therefore, the clinician must constantly pursue alternate paths of diagnosis and treatment when a likely cause of the problem is not obvious and/or the patient is refractory to accepted treatment protocols.",2018.0,2018-06-14,0,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000533653cbbea55412dc7d4a91f1cb9debc6498

However, the anti-cancer effect of CVBD on glioblastoma (GBM) has seldom been investigated. This study explores the activity of CVBD in inducing apoptosis of GBM cells, and examines the related mechanism in depth. Methods GBM cell lines (T98G, U251) and normal human astrocytes (HA) were treated with CVBD. Cell viability was examined by CCK-8 assay, and cell proliferation was evaluated by cell colony formation counts. Apoptosis and mitochondrial superoxide were measured by flow cytometry. All protein expression levels were determined by Western blotting. JC-1 and CM-H2DCFDA probes were used to evaluate the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) change and intracellular ROS generation, respectively. The cell ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Colocalization of cofilin and mitochondria were determined by immunofluorescence assay. Results CVBD showed a greater anti-proliferation effect on the GBM cell lines, T98G and U251, than normal human astrocytes in dose- and time-dependent manners. CVBD induced apoptosis and mitochondrial damage in GBM cells. We found that CVBD led to mitochondrial translocation of cofilin. Knockdown of cofilin attenuated CVBD-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial damage. Additionally, the generation of ROS and mitochondrial superoxide was also induced by CVBD in a dose-dependent manner. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and mitoquinone (MitoQ) pre-treatment reverted CVBD-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial damage. MitoQ pretreatment was able to block the mitochondrial translocation of cofilin caused by CVBD. Conclusions Our data revealed that CVBD induced apoptosis and mitochondrial damage in GBM cells. The underlying mechanism is related to mitochondrial translocation of cofilin caused by mitochondrial oxidant stress.",2021.0,2021-03-19,8,62,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005815eea33c8910e31e8fd0e24b0e544cd200f

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a new and potentially curative method for treating gastrointestinal neoplasms, may have longer procedure time and the risk of complications when compared to conventional endoscopic mucosal resection. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ESD in patients with comorbid diseases.


METHODS
The outcomes of 337 patients who underwent ESD for early gastric cancer at Samsung Medical Center from April 2003 to December 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. The Charlson comorbidity scale was used to divide the patients into low-risk (no risk factor) and high-risk (at least one risk factor) groups. The outcomes and complications were compared between the high- and low-risk groups.


RESULTS
The low- and high-risk groups comprised 240 and 97 patients with mean ages of 61.1 and 64.7 years, respectively (p=0.002). Tumor location, tumor size, depth of invasion, procedure duration, and rates of en bloc resection, complete resection, complication, and recurrence did not differ significantly between the two groups (p>0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
ESD may be a safe and effective treatment for early gastric cancer in patients with comorbid diseases.",2010.0,2010-06-30,26,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000605ab2b245c4984043ee15daf3bb6797fd117

10.3390/nu16132068,Survey of Physicians and Healers Using Amygdalin to Treat Cancer Patients,"Amygdalin is purported to exhibit anti-cancer properties when hydrolyzed to hydrogen cyanide (HCN). However, knowledge about amygdalin efficacy is limited. A questionnaire evaluating the efficacy, treatment, and dosing protocols, reasons for use, HCN levels, and toxicity was distributed to physicians and healers in Germany, providing amygdalin as an anti-cancer drug. Physicians (20) and healers (18) provided amygdalin over 8 (average) years to nearly 80 annually treated patients/providers. Information about amygdalin was predominantly obtained from colleagues (55%). Amygdalin was administered both intravenously (100%) and orally (32%). Intravenous application was considered to maximally delay disease progression (90%) and relieve symptoms (55%). Dosing was based on recommendations from colleagues (71%) or personal experience (47%). If limited success became apparent after an initial 3g/infusion, infusions were increased to 27g/infusion. Treatment response was primarily monitored with established (26%) and non-established tumor markers (19%). 90% did not monitor HCN levels. Negative effects were restricted to a few dizzy spells and nausea. Only 58% were willing to participate in clinical trials or contribute data for analysis (34%). Amygdalin infusions are commonly administered by healers and physicians with few side effects. The absence of standardized treatment calls for guidelines.

10.3390/ma14112968,Lutein Treatment Effects on the Redox Status and Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in Oral Cancer Squamous Cells—Are There Therapeutical Hopes?,"Carotenoids loaded in nanoparticles should be regarded as a promising way to increase the availability in healthy cells and to induce apoptosis in cancer. Lutein is a carotenoid that, in contrast to beta-carotene, has no known toxicities. Oral cancer represents one of the most frequent types of cancer world-wide with an incidence rate of about 9% of all types of cancer. Almost 95% of all oral cancers are represented by squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). The aim of this study was to review and analyse the effects of lutein and Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) Nps containing lutein (Lut Nps) on oxidative stress biomarkers (OXSR-1, FOXO-3, TAC) and collagen degradation biomarker–MMP-9, in human cells BICR10 of buccal mucosa squamous carcinoma. Lut Nps were prepared by the emulsion-solvent evaporation method. MMP, OXSR-1, TAC, FOXO-3 and MMP-9 were measured in tumour cell lysates by the ELISA technique. Our results have shown that in Lut 100 cells and Lut Nps the OXSR1 (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) and TAC (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) values were significantly higher than in control cells. The Lut 100 and Lut Nps FOXO-3 levels revealed no significant differences versus the control. MMP-9 levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) in the Lut Nps cells versus control cells. In our study conditions, lutein and lutein Nps did not trigger an oxidative stress by ROS induction. However, lutein Nps treatment seemed to have a positive effect, by downregulating the MMP-9 levels. Loaded in Nps, lutein could be regarded as a protective factor against local invasiveness, in whose molecular landscape MMPs, and especially MMP-9 are the main actors.",2021.0,2021-05-31,14,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0007767651135e2e809f616c37f72b5246e9e725

The current 5-year survival rate of women diagnosed with breast cancer is nearly 90%, due, in part, to the use of effective adjuvant therapies that often include aromatase inhibitors. However, long-term treatment with these therapies is known to have adverse effects on bone metabolism, leading to bone loss. Bone loss during adjuvant endocrine therapy may be higher than that observed during menopause and may require more potent therapy. Although there are approved treatments for osteolytic bone lesions from bone metastases, there is no approved therapy for bone loss associated with adjuvant cancer therapy.

10.1371/journal.pone.0312577,The impact of financial incentives promoting biosimilar products in oncology: A quasi-experimental study using administrative data,"Background Biosimilars have the potential to save a significant amount of money in cancer treatment costs. However, barriers exist in the adoption of biosimilar products. Japan introduced a new health policy in 2022 to promote the use of biosimilars in oncology by offering financial incentives to eligible hospitals. This study aims to examine the association between these financial incentives and prescription patterns. Methods The study analyzed Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data to assess the impact of the new health policy on the use of biosimilar products in oncology. The policy provided an additional fee for hospitals using biosimilar products. The study included patients with specific types of cancer and analyzed the proportion of monthly biosimilar prescriptions using the number of prescriptions of reference and biosimilar products. A generalized synthetic control method was used for analysis. Results From April 2020 to March 2023, the study involved 27,737 patients in 114 hospitals, with 63 eligible hospitals receiving financial incentives. The average number of prescriptions of the drugs (rituximab, trastuzumab, and bevacizumab) increased gradually in both eligible and ineligible hospitals. The financial incentives were associated with a significant increase in the proportion of biosimilar product prescriptions, with a monthly increase of 0.092 per month (95% CI, 0.040–0.145) [9.2%, 95% CI, 4.0–14.5] compared to ineligible hospitals. Conclusion Our study indicates that providing financial incentives to hospitals to utilize biosimilar products increased their prescriptions.

Based on the results, we tentatively present suggestions for the cancer health care model. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted with 2915 cancer survivors recruited from multi-community cancer rehabilitation centers, all of which were affiliated with the Shanghai Cancer Rehabilitation Club. We collected data including socio-demographic characteristics and information about PA. All the subjects included were asked to complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—General Questionnaire (FACT-G). Multiple linear regression models were employed to control the potential confounding factors. Results Lung cancer survivors reported the worst dyspnea. Colorectal cancer survivors claimed the highest level of constipation and diarrhea. Liver cancer survivors indicated greatest loss of appetite and financial difficulties. Generally, survivors with PA tended to reported better QOL, although these associations among liver cancer survivors were not statistically significant. Moreover, survivors of all cancer types who performed PA did not report significant lower level of constipation or diarrhea. The relationship between PA frequency and QOL among cancer survivors remained unexplored. Conclusions Both QOL and its association with PA vary among survivors of different cancer types.

To compare the effects of two adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, anthracycline-based and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorourical (CMF) on disease free survival for breast cancer patients in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Asia.


METHODS
In a systematic review with a multivariate mixed model meta-analysis, the reported survival proportion at multiple time points in different studies were combined. Our data sources were studies linking the two chemotherapy regimens on an adjuvant basis with disease free survival published in English and Persian in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Asia. All survival curves were generated with Graphdigitizer software.


RESULTS
14 retrospective cohort studies were located from electronic databases. We analyzed data for 1,086 patients who received anthracycline-based treatment and 1,109 given CMF treatment. For determination of survival proportions and time we usesb the transformation Ln (-Ln(S)) and Ln (time) to make precise estimations and then fit the model. All analyses were carried out with STATA software.

The aim was to examine the anti-proliferative effect of a Withania somnifera (WS) root extract in cell cultures and nude mouse xenografts of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.


METHODS
WS root extract was used to treat tumor cells at concentrations up to 100 µg and for nude mouse experiments, the mice received daily WS at 300 mg/kg by oral gavage for 8 weeks.


RESULTS
The WS extract reduced viability of MDA-MB-231 cells by 75% and 88% after exposure of the cells to 50 and 100 µg/mL, respectively, compared to vehicle-treated controls. WS extract caused a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase compared to untreated controls by 6% and 10% after exposure to 25 and 50 µg/mL WS extract, respectively. WS extract also inhibited proliferation of xenografted MDA-MB-231 cells. The WS extract caused reductions in xenograft size by 60% compared to the untreated control after 8 weeks of treatment. Six of ten mice in the control group showed tumor metastasis to the lung, whereas there was none in the mice treated with the WS extract. At the gene level, WS caused a 75% reduction in chemokine CCL2 expression (P < 0.05) in the xenografted tumors of the treated mice.


CONCLUSION
WS root extract inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and significantly reduced expression of the cytokine, CCL2.

10.1111/jdv.18200,Anticancer treatments and photosensitivity,"Drug‐induced photosensitivity is associated with a wide range of anticancer treatments, including conventional chemotherapeutic agents, targeted anticancer therapies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These dermatologic adverse events can have a major impact on the well‐being and quality of life of cancer patients, leading to dose modifications and interruption or discontinuation of anticancer treatments in severe cases. However, the heterogeneous nature of the photosensitive reactions induced by these agents, as well as the common concomitant use of other potentially photosensitizing drugs (antibiotics, voriconazole, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, etc.), can make the diagnosis and, therefore the prevention, of these adverse events particularly challenging. The aim of this review is to describe the most characteristic forms of photosensitivity observed in patients being treated with anticancer treatments, including phototoxicity and photoallergy, and other potentially photo‐induced manifestations such as UV recall, exaggerated sunburn reactions associated with treatment‐related vitiligo, drug‐induced cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and UV‐induced hyperpigmentation. We also discuss the photosensitive reactions recently reported with new‐generation targeted anticancer therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors and highlight the importance of continued surveillance to identify photosensitizing agents, and of educating patients on the need for preventive UVA/UVB photoprotective measures.",2022.0,2022-06-01,8,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00090aff129b5ff82128d58e38e1836e8e21f862

10.3390/cancers14082027,Circulating Nucleic Acids as Novel Biomarkers for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,"Simple Summary Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a particularly aggressive and deadly cancer, primarily due to failure to identify early-stage disease. PDAC is often diagnosed at a late stage due to nonspecific symptoms, and a distinct lack of reliable biomarkers for timely diagnosis. Current PDAC biomarkers are inadequate for the monitoring of a patient’s response to treatment. The aim of this review is to highlight the potential use of circulating nucleic acid-based biomarkers, along with technology facilitating their detection, in liquid biopsies. These biomarkers primarily focus on the detection of PDAC-specific genetic mutations, both freely circulating and contained within exosomes. Abstract Despite considerable advancements in the clinical management of PDAC it remains a significant cause of mortality. PDAC is often diagnosed at advanced stages due to vague symptoms associated with early-stage disease and a lack of reliable diagnostic biomarkers. Late diagnosis results in a high proportion of cases being ineligible for surgical resection, the only potentially curative therapy for PDAC. Furthermore, a lack of prognostic biomarkers impedes clinician’s ability to properly assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Advances in our ability to detect circulating nucleic acids allows for the advent of novel biomarkers for PDAC. Tumor derived circulating and exosomal nucleic acids allow for the detection of PDAC-specific mutations through a non-invasive blood sample. Such biomarkers could expand upon the currently limited repertoire of tests available.

10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-0111,Lactate-Modulated Immunosuppression of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Contributes to the Radioresistance of Pancreatic Cancer,"Pancreatic cancer tends to be radioresistant, but the immune-mediated mechanisms behind this resistance are unclear. Lactate secretion from pancreatic tumor cells leads to immune-suppressive MDSCs via HIF-1α signaling in MDSCs, limiting radiotherapy efficacy in pancreatic cancer. The mechanisms responsible for radioresistance in pancreatic cancer have yet to be elucidated, and the suppressive tumor immune microenvironment must be considered. We investigated whether the radiotherapy-augmented Warburg effect helped myeloid cells acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype, resulting in limited treatment efficacy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Radiotherapy enhanced the tumor-promoting activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in pancreatic cancer. Sustained increase in lactate secretion, resulting from the radiation-augmented Warburg effect, was responsible for the enhanced immunosuppressive phenotype of MDSCs after radiotherapy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was essential for tumor cell metabolism and lactate-regulated activation of MDSCs via the G protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81)/mTOR/HIF-1α/STAT3 pathway. Blocking lactate production in tumor cells or deleting Hif-1α in MDSCs reverted antitumor T-cell responses and effectively inhibited tumor progression after radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Our investigation highlighted the importance of radiation-induced lactate in regulating the inhibitory immune microenvironment of PDAC. Targeting lactate derived from tumor cells and the HIF-1α signaling in MDSCs may hold distinct promise for clinical therapies to alleviate radioresistance in PDAC.",2020.0,2020-09-11,128,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00099abe7c1e473d07f1d3749e685c20d23e4c92

10.1101/2021.03.01.433348,Copy number variant heterogeneity among cancer types reflects inconsistent concordance with diagnostic classifications,"Due to frequent genome instability and accumulation of mutations during the neoplastic process, malignant tumors present with patterns of somatic genome variants on diverse levels of heterogeneity. The delineation of pathophysiological consequences of these patterns remains one of the main challenges in cancer prognosis and treatment. Although continuous efforts aim for better characterization of cancer entities through inclusion of molecular characteristics, current ontology systems still heavily rely on clinico-pathological features. Traditionally, malignant diseases have been classified using domain-specific or generalized classification systems, based on histopathological features and clinical gestalt. Aside from the general purpose “International Classification for Diseases in Oncology” (ICD-O; WHO), hierarchical terminologies such as NCIt promote data interoperability and ontology-driven computational analysis. To evaluate two prominent, general cancer classification systems (NCIt and ICD-O) towards their concordance with genomic mutation patterns we have performed a data-driven meta-analysis of 83’505 curated cancer samples with genome-wide CNA (copy number aberration) profiles from our Progenetix database.

10.7717/peerj.9650,Proteins from Lignosus tigris with selective apoptotic cytotoxicity towards MCF7 cell line and suppresses MCF7-xenograft tumor growth,"Background Lignosus tigris, a recently discovered species of the unique Lignosus family, has been traditionally used by the indigenous communities in Peninsular Malaysia to treat various ailments and as an alternative medicine for cancer treatment. The L. tigris cultivar sclerotia (Ligno TG-K) was found to contain numerous bioactive compounds with beneficial biomedicinal properties and the sclerotial extract exhibited potent antioxidant activity. However, the anticancer property of the Ligno TG-K including in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects as well as its anticancer active compounds and the mechanisms has yet to be investigated. Methods The cytotoxicity of the Ligno TG-K against human breast (MCF7), prostate (PC3) and lung (A549) adenocarcinoma cell lines was evaluated using MTT cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxic mechanisms of the active high molecular weight proteins (HMWp) fraction were investigated through detection of caspases activity and apoptotic-related proteins expression by Western blotting. The in vivo antitumor activity of the isolated HMWp was examined using MCF7 mouse xenograft model. Shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to identify the proteins in the HMWp. Results and Discussion Cold water extract of the sclerotia inhibited proliferation of MCF7, A549 and PC3 cells with IC50 ranged from 28.9 to 95.0 µg/mL. Bioassay guided fractionation of the extract revealed that HMWp exhibited selective cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells via induction of cellular apoptosis by the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. HMWp activated expression of caspase-8 and -9 enzymes, and pro-apoptotic Bax protein whilst inhibiting expression of tumor survivor protein, Bcl-2. HMWp induced tumor-cell apoptosis and suppressed growth of tumor in MCF-7 xenograft mice. Lectins, serine proteases, RNase Gf29 and a 230NA deoxyribonuclease are the major cytotoxic proteins that accounted for 55.93% of the HMWp. Conclusion The findings from this study provided scientific evidences to support the traditional use of the L. tigris sclerotia for treatment of breast cancer. Several cytotoxic proteins with high abundance have been identified in the HMWp of the sclerotial extract and these proteins have potential to be developed into new anticancer agents or as adjunct cancer therapy.",2020.0,2020-08-04,9,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a3cf0e410d81d52f57642ff661690d92b0e24

10.21037/ATM-20-5704,Metformin and oxyphotodynamic therapy as a novel treatment approach for triple-negative breast cancer,"Background Treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a significant challenge due to a lack of targeted therapies. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been utilized as a treatment approach for several types of cancer, oxyphotodynamic therapy (OPDT) is a novel method that improves treatment efficacy by increasing local oxygen concentration. Metformin (MET) has been demonstrated utility as an anti-tumor agent by acting through the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. We hypothesized that MET in combination with heme, a byproduct of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), may increase cytotoxicity for cancer treatment. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of MET and ALA with PDT or OPDT on TNBC tumorigenic cells. Methods The treatment efficacy and phototoxicity of PDT or OPDT were determined using a cell viability assay. PDT/OPDT experiments were carried out in nine groups based on different combinations and concentrations of ALA and/or MET. To calculate the synergistic effect by compuSyn soft for different groups, cells were incubated with ALA and/or MET at the following concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5,1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 mM). The fluorescence of ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and MitoTracker Green were observed under a confocal microscope. Results The optimized therapeutic concentration ratio of ALA and MET was determined to be 1:1. The inhibition of cancer growth (IC50) for each group was 14.03, 10.62, 7.71, 18.27, 22.09, 23.96, 4.57, 10.20, and 8.18 mM, respectively. The combination index (CI) values (fa =0.5) of the last three combination groups (groups 7, 8, and 9) were 0.44, 1.70, and 1.47, respectively. PpIX fluorescence intensity of group 9 (ALA-MET-OPDT group) remained the highest among all groups, indicating an enhanced therapeutic effect. Conclusions This study introduces OPDT as a novel anti-tumor therapy for TNBC. Furthermore, the combined use of ALA and MET had a synergistic anti-tumor effect in TNBC cells when combined with OPDT.",2020.0,2020-09-01,9,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a6ffbba16e9571263c30613a130c791e2aa69
10.3390/cancers13071702,Immunomodulatory Effects of Bendamustine in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation,"Simple Summary Bendamustine is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat a variety of cancers. It has recently been used in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a treatment mostly used to treat blood cancers. Given before or after transplantation of donor blood or bone marrow cells, bendamustine has been shown to reduce the side effects of the transplant, including graft-versus-host disease, where the donated cells attack the recipient’s tissues, while also promoting the anti-cancer effects of the transplant. These are exciting findings and show that bendamustine may be used to influence the immune system, called immunomodulation, in a beneficial manner. We report our research and review the available literature outlining these immunomodulatory effects of bendamustine, in hopes that it will promote further investigations utilizing this agent in allogeneic transplants, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Abstract Bendamustine (BEN) is a unique alkylating agent with efficacy against a broad range of hematological malignancies, although investigations have only recently started to delve into its immunomodulatory effects. These immunomodulatory properties of BEN in the context of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are reviewed here. Pre- and post-transplant use of BEN in multiple murine models have consistently resulted in reduced GvHD and enhanced GvL, with significant changes to key immunological cell populations, including T-cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and dendritic cells (DCs). Further, in vitro studies find that BEN enhances the suppressive function of MDSCs, skews DCs toward cDC1s, enhances Flt3 expression on DCs, increases B-cell production of IL-10, inhibits STAT3 activation, and suppresses proliferation of T- and B-cells. Overall, BEN has a broad range of immunomodulatory effects that, as they are further elucidated, may be exploited to improve clinical outcomes. As such, clinical trials are currently underway investigating new potential applications of BEN in the setting of allogeneic HCT.",2021.0,2021-04-01,13,124,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000ab42e3f89b4c7b20fd19ca108a3e36d81b7f6

10.3389/fimmu.2023.1298891,The molecular mechanism of actions and clinical utilities of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in gastrointestinal cancers: a comprehensive review and future prospects toward personalized medicine,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers remain a significant global health burden, accounting for a substantial number of cases and deaths. Regrettably, the inadequacy of dependable biomarkers hinders the precise forecasting of patient prognosis and the selection of appropriate therapeutic sequencing for individuals with GI cancers, leading to suboptimal outcomes for numerous patients. The intricate interplay between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) has been shown to be a pivotal determinant of response to anti-cancer therapy and consequential clinical outcomes across a multitude of cancer types. Therefore, the assessment of TILs has garnered global interest as a promising prognostic biomarker in oncology, with the potential to improve clinical decision-making substantially. Moreover, recent discoveries in immunotherapy have progressively changed the landscape of cancer treatment and significantly prolonged the survival of patients with advanced cancers. Nonetheless, the response rate remains constrained within solid tumor sufferers, even when TIL landscapes appear comparable, which calls for the development of our understanding of cellular and molecular cross-talk between TIME and tumor. Hence, this comprehensive review encapsulates the extant literature elucidating the TILs’ underlying molecular pathogenesis, prognostic significance, and their relevance in the realm of immunotherapy for patients afflicted by GI tract cancers. Within this review, we demonstrate that the type, density, and spatial distribution of distinct TIL subpopulations carries pivotal implications for the prediction of anti-cancer treatment responses and patient survival. Furthermore, this review underscores the indispensable role of TILs in modulating therapeutic responses within distinct molecular subtypes, such as those characterized by microsatellite stability or programmed cell death ligand-1 expression in GI tract cancers. The review concludes by outlining future directions in TIL-based personalized medicine, including integrating TIL-based approaches into existing treatment regimens and developing novel therapeutic strategies that exploit the unique properties of TILs and their potential as a promising avenue for personalized cancer treatment.",2023.0,2023-11-24,3,206,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b53adc61edcdde1fa0c8a7095817b296e04c3

10.4081/aiua.2017.4.282,Medical management in locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer: Does changes in treatment policy have any specific effect on PSA levels?,"OBJECTIVE
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used as a first-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic prostatic cancer (Pca). There is no consensus about which alternative treatment should be used after the failure of initial ADT. We aimed to investigate the effect of changes in treatment on PSA and testosterone levels.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 120 patients with an established diagnosis of either locally advanced or metastatic Pca in two different centers. Depending on the type of medical and/or surgical management protocol planned at initial presentation, all cases were divided into three main groups as follows. Group 1 (n: 80) included the patients who underwent medical management during whole follow-up period in whom the initial management protocol was later on switched to another medical treatment with different agents, Group 2 (n: 20) included patients who were initially treated with a medical management protocol and switched to surgical castration during follow-up evaluation and lastly Group 3 (n: 20) included the patients undergoing treated surgical castration as initial treatment modality without any further medical management protocol.


RESULTS
Evaluation of our data did clearly demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the initial and final PSA as well as testosterone levels in Group 1 cases. Mean PSA and testosterone levels increased significantly in these cases despite a change in hormonal therapy by using another agent for androgen deprivation. Cases in Group 2 and 3 cases did not show any statistically significant difference with respect to the mean PSA as well as testosterone values during the same follow-up period.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data clearly indicated that in case of a biochemical progression, switching into another alternative medical treatment was not effective enough in limiting the rising PSA levels in a statistically significant manner when compared with the approaches of switching to surgical castration after initial medical treatment or continuing with regular and close follow-up after initial surgical castration alone.",2017.0,2017-12-31,3,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b735e323dae7bae69a34928cfeebea1410146

10.3390/ijerph20042931,Patient-Reported Outcomes and Experiences Assessment in Women with Breast Cancer: Portuguese Case Study,"In 2020, female breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, representing the type of cancer with the highest incidence among women and the second most common cause of cancer death among women in all OECD countries. The conventional measures addressing the burden of breast cancer by measuring mortality, incidence, and survival do not entirely reflect the quality of life and patients experience when receiving breast cancer care. The main objective of this study is to capture patient-reported outcomes and experiences in women with breast cancer in Portugal using methods developed for international benchmarking purposes, such as the OECD Patient-reported Indicators Surveys. The study included 378 women with breast cancer, with the age distribution being 19.8% aged 15 to 49 years and 80.2% aged 50 years and over. The data collection procedure and analysis followed the “OECD Breast Cancer Patient Reported Outcomes Working Group” protocol, allowing subsequent comparability with data from other OECD member countries. Most women were satisfied with the treatment outcome regarding the shape of their lumpectomy breast when wearing a bra (96.1%) and with the equal size of both breasts (78.3%). Findings on the WHO QOL-BREF showed that women manifest a lower score in well-being when compared with the general population or populations living with chronic diseases. This study shows the feasibility of implementing and using patient-reported metrics (PROM and PREM) in breast cancer services in Portugal.

10.3892/ijo.2014.2523,Inhibition of Cdk2 kinase activity selectively targets the CD44+/CD24−/Low stem-like subpopulation and restores chemosensitivity of SUM149PT triple-negative breast cancer cells,"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an angioinvasive and most aggressive type of advanced breast cancer characterized by rapid proliferation, chemoresistance, early metastatic development and poor prognosis. IBC tumors display a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype characterized by centrosome amplification, high grade of chromosomal instability (CIN) and low levels of expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER-2 tyrosine kinase receptor. Since the TNBC cells lack these receptors necessary to promote tumor growth, common treatments such as endocrine therapy and molecular targeting of HER-2 receptor are ineffective for this subtype of breast cancer. To date, not a single targeted therapy has been approved for non-inflammatory and inflammatory TNBC tumors and combination of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents remains the standard therapy. IBC tumors generally display activation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is functionally linked to a CD44+/CD24−/Low stem-like phenotype. Development of EMT and consequent activation of stemness programming is responsible for invasion, tumor self-renewal and drug resistance leading to breast cancer progression, distant metastases and poor prognosis. In this study, we employed the luminal ER+ MCF-7 and the IBC SUM149PT breast cancer cell lines to establish the extent to which high grade of CIN and chemoresistance were mechanistically linked to the enrichment of CD44+/CD24low/− CSCs. Here, we demonstrate that SUM149PT cells displayed higher CIN than MCF-7 cells characterized by higher percentage of structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations. Moreover, centrosome amplification, cyclin E overexpression and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) were restricted to the stem-like CD44+/CD24−/Low subpopulation isolated from SUM149PT cells. Significantly, CD44+/CD24−/Low CSCs displayed resistance to conventional chemotherapy but higher sensitivity to SU9516, a specific cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) inhibitor, demonstrating that aberrant activation of cyclin E/Cdk2 oncogenic signaling is essential for the maintenance and expansion of CD44+/CD24−/Low CSC subpopulation in IBC. In conclusion, our findings propose a novel therapeutic approach to restore chemosensitivity and delay recurrence of IBC tumors based on the combination of conventional chemotherapy with small molecule inhibitors of the Cdk2 cell cycle kinase.",2014.0,2014-06-25,45,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000bf50d72f9c6f7d518b073ddff175cda25e0e9

METHODS: Ninety three patients were included in this retrospective study. The patients received 66 Gy radiotherapy and weekly 20 mg/m2 docetaxel and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin chemotherapy concomitantly. One month later than the end of CRT, consolidation chemotherapy with four cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 were administered at each 21 days. RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 57 (range, 30-74). Following concomitant CRT, 14 patients (15%) showed complete and 50 patients (54%) showed partial response (total response rate was 69%). The median follow-up was 13 months (range: 2-51 months). The median overall survival was 18 months (95% confidential interval [CI]: 13.8-22.1 months); local control was 15 months (95% CI: 9.3-20.6 months); progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI: 6.5-11.4 months). Esophagitis in eight (9%) patients, neutropenia in seven (8%) patients and pneumonitis in eight (9%) patients developed as grade III-IV toxicity due to concomitant CRT. CONCLUSION: Concomitant CRT with docetaxel and cisplatin followed by docetaxel and cisplatin consolidation chemotherapy might be considered as a feasible, and well tolerated treatment modality with high response rates despite the fact that it has not a survival advantage in patients with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC.",2013.0,2013-04-01,8,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c785fc7593ccf8800ed7aeab6f304f6bcb3d5

Experimental Design: After approval by the institutional ethics review boards from three separate screening centers, a total of 23,993 Chinese women ages 20 to 65 years were randomly assigned into one of the two groups: a DNA cytometry testing group (11,999 women) and a cytologic testing group (11,994 women). Each woman underwent the other testing after first attending the assigned screening test. Women with positive results after assigned testing additionally underwent colposcopy and human papillomaviruses detections, and those with cervical precancerous or cancerous lesions received appropriate treatment. Sensitivity and specificity estimates were adjusted for verification bias. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol ways. Results: In the cytometric DNA testing group, cervical cancer was diagnosed in 40 subjects, compared with 24 subjects in the cytologic testing group [hazard ratio for the detection of advanced cancer in the DNA cytometry testing group, 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27-0.60]. The sensitivity of the DNA cytometry testing for cervical cancer was 91.7% (95% CI, 64.3-95.8), whereas the sensitivity of cytologic testing was 44.5% (95% CI, 25.2-61.3; P = 0.008). The specificity was 54.1% (95% CI, 31.6-69.0) for DNA cytometry testing and 70.6% (95% CI, 46.8-82.5; P = 0.003) for cytologic testing. The sensitivity of both tests used together was 100%, and the specificity was 91.8%. A total of 187 subjects reported mild to severe adverse events after treatment with positive results in 319 women. Conclusions: Our results highlight the benefit of the DNA cytometry testing strategy in mass cervical cancer screening with greater sensitivity and positive predicted value than the conventional cytologic testing in developing settings.

This study is aimed to review most recently available evidence on the clinical effectiveness of topical sunscreen in preventing skin cancers. We identified literature from online databases including Pubmed and Google Scholar and included population-based study evaluating the effect of sunscreen usage and risk of skin cancers, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) either as primary objective or as a confounder in multivariate analysis. Data form included articles was harvested and analyzed with thematic analysis. Final analysis included 11 articles. Of these, 6 reported results on melanoma, 4 reported on BCC, and 3 on SCC. Overall, there was conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of topical sunscreen in preventing skin cancer. Available evidence found that topical sunscreen was most effective in preventing melanoma and SCC. However, there was considerable heterogenicity in study design and definition of sunscreen treatment between included articles that may affect the results. There are no consensus among included articles, including among RCTs, on the ideal topical sunscreen regiment to prevent skin cancer. There are conflicting evidence on the clinical effectiveness of topical sunscreen to prevent skin cancer although evidence suggest that it would be effective in preventing melanoma and SCC.

These all factors cumulatively reduce drug exposure at the target site leading to multidrug resistance (MDR). Lipid based carriers systems has been explored to overcome solubility and permeability related issues of anti-cancer drugs. The lipid based formulations have also been reported to circumvent the effect of P-gp and CYP3A4. Further long chain triglycerides (LCT) has shown their ability to access Lymphatic route over Medium Chain Triglycerides, as the former has been extensively used for targeting anti-cancer drugs at proliferating cells through lymphatic route. Therefore this review tries to reflect the usefulness of lipid based drug carriers systems (viz. liposome, solid lipid nanoparticle, nano-lipid carriers, self-emulsifying, lipidic pro-drugs) in targeting lymphatic system and overcoming issues related to solubility and permeability of anti-cancer drugs.

This study aimed to investigate the functional role of melatonin in urothelial carcinogenesis. Materials and Methods: In human normal urothelial SVHUC cells with exposure to the chemical carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene, we assessed the effects of melatonin on the neoplastic/malignant transformation. Results: In the in vitro system with carcinogen challenge, melatonin significantly prevented the neoplastic transformation of SV-HUC-1 cells. In addition, melatonin treatment resulted in increased expression of SIRT1, Rb1, and E-cadherin, and decreased expression of N-cadherin and FGFR3 in SV-HUC-1 cells. Furthermore, publicly available datasets from GSE3167 revealed that the expression of melatonin receptor 1 and melatonin receptor 2 was significantly down-regulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma tissues, compared with adjacent normal urothelial tissues. Conclusion: These findings indicate that melatonin serves as a suppressor for urothelial tumorigenesis.

These parameters are among the most significant factors underlying the metabolism and physiology of solid tumors, regardless of their type or origin. Low oxygen tension contributes to both inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and therapeutic resistance of tumors; low extracellular pH, the reverse of normal cells, mainly enhances tumor invasion; and dysregulated GSH and redox potential within cancer cells favor their proliferation. In fact, cancer cells under these microenvironmental conditions appreciably alter tumor response to cytotoxic anti-cancer treatments. Recent experiments measured the in vivo longitudinal data of these four parameters with tumor development and the corresponding presence and absence of tumor macrophage HIF-1α or HIF-2α in a mouse model of breast cancer. In the current paper, we present a mathematical model-based system of (ordinary and partial) differential equations to monitor tumor growth and susceptibility to standard chemotherapy with oxygen level, pH, and intracellular GSH concentration. We first show that our model simulations agree with the corresponding experiments, and then we use our model to suggest treatments of tumors by altering these four parameters in tumor microenvironment. For example, the model qualitatively predicts that GSH depletion can raise the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) above a toxic threshold and result in inhibition of tumor growth.",2014.0,2014-10-08,23,83,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000e2e67f42b59241ade8bfac12c833c74ef051c

This study’s objectives were to assess geriatric oncology practices in Portugal and investigate medical professionals’ current needs and perceptions on the treatment of elderly cancer patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a web-based survey of healthcare providers treating elderly patients. Results: There were 222 responses: 62.6% of physicians reported the absence of geriatric oncology and/or geriatrics consultations in their institutions, 14.9% had guidelines for the management of older patients with cancer and 4.5% had physicians dedicated to geriatric oncology. The reported use of geriatric assessment tools was 23.4%. Medical oncologists and physicians from medical specialties (p = 0.009) and those practicing in the south of Portugal (p = 0.054) were more likely to use geriatric assessment. Education and training in geriatric oncology was identified by 95.0% of respondents as an unmet need. The inquiries identified that geriatric assessment could be useful to define a therapeutic strategy (85.1%), detect frailty (77.5%), predict toxicity and improve quality of life (73.4%). Conclusions: There is a paucity of expertise and training in geriatric oncology in Portugal but an increasing perception of the value of geriatric assessment and the demand for education.

HIF is a heterodimeric transcription factor containing an inducible HIFα subunit and a constitutively expressed HIFβ subunit. The signaling pathways operational in macrophages regulating hypoxia-induced HIFα stabilization remain the subject of intense investigation. Here, it was discovered that the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling axis controls hypoxia-induced HIF1α (HIF1A) and HIF2α (EPAS1) stability in macrophages. Using genetic mouse models and pan-PI3K as well as isoform-specific inhibitors, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway blocked the accumulation of HIFα protein and its primary transcriptional target VEGF in response to hypoxia. Moreover, blocking the PI3K/AKT signaling axis promoted the hypoxic degradation of HIFα via the 26S proteasome. Mechanistically, a macrophage-dominant PI3K isoform (p110γ) directed tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and the HIFα/VEGF axis. Moreover, a pan-PI3K inhibitor (SF1126) blocked tumor-induced angiogenesis and inhibited VEGF and other proangiogenic factors secreted by macrophages. These data define a novel molecular mechanism by which PTEN/PI3K/AKT regulates the proteasome-dependent stability of HIFα under hypoxic conditions, a signaling pathway in macrophages that controls tumor-induced angiogenesis and metastasis. Implications: This study indicates that PI3K inhibitors are excellent candidates for the treatment of cancers where macrophages promote tumor progression.

10.3892/ETM.2015.2499,Successful treatment of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer with reduced-dose gefitinib: A case report.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is a favorable prognostic factor of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the majority of patients with EGFR mutations, clinical benefits of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been reported. One of the TKIs, gefitinib, appears to be less toxic to the skin than other TKIs. The present study reports a case of NSCLC with EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion) in which dose-reduced gefitinib was effective against recurrence. Due to development of a grade 3 skin adverse event (AE) after 2 months of daily administration of gefitinib, the frequency of administration of gefitinib was reduced to every other day for 2 weeks. As the AE continued, the frequency of administration was reduced to once every 3 days. The patient has been in remission for 27 months since treatment with 250 mg gefitinib once every 3 days was initiated, which is the lowest dose to be reported in a successfully treated case of NSCLC with EGFR mutation. Dose reduction of gefitinib might be appropriate for patients with severe AEs and should be considered as a treatment option after 1 or 2 months of regular daily dosing of gefitinib if there is no other satisfactory treatment option.",2015.0,2015-07-01,3,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f786bf0bb74b19c65777780fc84ead081168a

10.1111/cas.15517,Chronological improvement in precision oncology implementation in Japan,"In Japan, comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) tests for refractory cancer patients have been approved since June 2019, under the requirement that all cases undergoing CGP tests are annotated by the molecular tumor board (MTB) at each government‐designated hospital. To investigate improvement in precision oncology, we evaluated and compared the proportion of cases receiving matched treatments according to CGP results and those recommended to receive genetic counseling at all core hospitals between the first period (11 hospitals, June 2019 to January 2020) and second period (12 hospitals, February 2020 to January 2021). A total of 754 and 2294 cases underwent CGP tests at core hospitals in the first and second periods, respectively; 28 (3.7%) and 176 (7.7%) patients received matched treatments (p < 0.001). Additionally, 25 (3.3%) and 237 (10.3%) cases were recommended to receive genetic counseling in the first and second periods, respectively (p < 0.001). The proportion was associated with the type of CGP test: tumor‐only (N = 2391) vs. tumor‐normal paired (N = 657) analysis (10.0% vs. 3.5%). These results suggest that recommendations regarding available clinical trials in networked MTBs might contribute to increasing the numbers of matched treatments, and that tumor‐normal paired rather than tumor‐only tests can increase the efficiency of patient referrals for genetic counseling.",2021.0,2021-09-01,19,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f885bba876e6b1c2fc02a4a83c3d3c317ecbf

However, no systematic work has so far been carried out to test its anti-cancer potential against cervix cancer cells in vitro. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether ethanolic extract of conium is capable of inducing cytotoxicity in different normal and cancer cell lines including an elaborate study in HeLa cells. Materials and Methods: Conium's effects on cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and apoptosis, if any, were analyzed through flow cytometry. Whether Conium could damage DNA and induce morphological changes were also determined microscopically. Expression of different proteins related to cell death and survival was critically studied by western blotting and ELISA methods. If Conium could interact directly with DNA was also determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Results: Conium treatment reduced cell viability and colony formation at 48 h and inhibited cell proliferation, arresting cell cycle at sub-G stage. Conium treatment lead to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at 24 h, increase in MMP depolarization, morphological changes and DNA damage in HeLa cells along with externalization of phosphatidyl serine at 48 hours. While cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation led HeLa cells toward apoptosis, down-regulation of Akt and NFkB inhibited cellular proliferation, indicating the signaling pathway to be mediated via the mitochondria-mediated caspase-3-dependent pathway. CD-spectroscopy revealed that Conium interacted with DNA molecule. Conclusion: Overall results validate anti-cancer potential of Conium and provide support for its use in traditional systems of medicine.",2014.0,2014-08-01,35,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000fb3e0d8ed8d265187704aa306aa292d1c2205

Vietlife-Antican (VLA) is a novel combination of curcumin solid lipid nanoparticles, ginger oleoresin solid lipid nanoparticles, and rutin solid lipid nanoparticles, which all possess low toxicity and enhanced bioavailabilities. To clarify the antitumor effects of this product, cytotoxic tests of VLA were conducted in various cancer cell lines in vitro and in an in vivo tumorized mouse model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. VLA expressed some cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MCF7), hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2), lung cancer cells (SK-LU-1), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (SW480), and human leukemia cells (HL-60). Additionally, LLC tumor-bearing mice treated with VLA (600 mg/kg body weight [bw]) exhibited significant reductions in tumor growth (P < 0.05), a longer mean survival time (34.05 days), and improved liver function. Furthermore, a combination of VLA (200 mg/kg bw) and cisplatin strongly suppressed tumor development and increased mean survival time (P < 0.05). Interestingly, cotreatment with VLA and cisplatin also induced the serum production of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10, which are important antitumor and anti-inflammatory cytokines, respectively, in tumorized mice.

10.1002/acm2.13628,"COVID‐19, cancer post‐pandemic risk, and the radiation oncology physicist","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the health-care industry in the United States and worldwide. Nearly every aspect of healthcare was impacted, including but not limited to research and development, purchasing and inventory management, healthcare delivery, human resource management, and standard operating procedures. In almost every care setting, artifacts of the COVID-19 pandemic linger in the form of changes in policies and procedures, redistribution of staff and resources, shortages and oversupplies of key resources, and a shared desire to capture consistency and normalcy following a 24-month storm. In the United States, the sustainability of health-care systems following this major disruption remains an important challenge as revenue from profitable elective outpatient procedures shrunk and the demand for critical care soared. Furthermore, multiple surges in the pandemic required a shift in resources and staff to less profitable intensive care units, whereas regions impacted most triggered a national redistribution of resources, nurses, and other health-care workers. The health-care industry in the United States is complicated. Although some market forces like competition and quality impact health-care delivery in a similar manner to other private sector industries, health systems also coordinate and collaborate to provide population health services, deliver individual care, participate in the advancement of knowledge, and establish processes and standards of care based on data.The advancement and implementation of knowledge and best practices is a shared experience based on the evidence, debate, and consensus.

Recent insights have shown that perceived injustice (PI) can play a substantial role in these side effects, but research on cancer survivors is scarce. Furthermore, guidelines for recognizing clinically relevant levels of PI in cancer survivors are missing. The aims of this study are to provide a clinically relevant cut-off for PI and to explore relationships between personal characteristics, symptoms, and QoL with PI. This multicenter, cross-sectional study uses the Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Patient-Specific Complaints (PSC), Multidimensional Fatigue Index (MFI), and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30). A clinical cut-off for PI was identified based on the 75th percentile of IEQ scores. Univariate and multivariate regressions explored the relationship between PI and personal characteristics (sex, age, cancer type, treatment type), symptoms (pain intensity, fatigue), and QoL (daily activity complaints, cancer-related QoL). Cancer survivors (n = 121) were included, and a cut-off of 20 was identified. Significant indirect associations were found between chemotherapy, NPRS, PSC, MFI, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 with PI.

Methods Eligible participants were all patients with histologically confirmed cervical cancer treated at Chiang Mai University Hospital between 1995 and 2011. We included all patients with SNEC and randomly enrolled patients with ADC and SCC. We used competing-risk regression analysis to examine the risk of cancer-related death by histological type. Results We included 130 (6.2%) women with SNEC, 346 (16.4%) with ADC, and 1,632 (77.4%) with SCC. Age >60 years (hazard ratio [HR] 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–12.0) and lymph node involvement (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2–7.4) were prognostic factors among surgically-treated patients with SNEC. Deeper stromal invasion (HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6–8.3) was a prognostic factor in patients with SCC. In patients with advanced SNEC, age >60 years had a strong prognostic impact (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0–6.5) while the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages III and IV were prognostic factors for patients with advanced stage ADC (HR 2.9, 95% CI 2.0–4.4 and HR 4.5, 95% CI 2.6–7.9, respectively) and SCC (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4–2.0 and HR 3.7, 95% CI 2.8–4.9, respectively) compared with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB.

Patients with locally advanced or metastatic CRC received FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy (chemo) or chemo in combination with cetuximab. Baseline plasma samples from 152 patients were analyzed for six candidate markers [epidermal growth factor (EGF), heparin‐binding EGF (HBEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, HER3, and CD73]. Analyte levels were associated with survival endpoints using univariate Cox proportional hazards models. Predictive markers were identified using a treatment‐by‐marker interaction term in the Cox model. Plasma levels of EGF, HBEGF, HER3, and CD73 were prognostic for overall survival (OS) across all patients (KRAS mutant and wild‐type). High levels of EGF predicted for lack of OS benefit from cetuximab in KRAS wild‐type (WT) patients (chemo HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.74–1.29; chemo+cetuximab HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.05–2.25; interaction P = 0.045) and benefit from cetuximab in KRAS mutant patients (chemo HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.02–2.92; chemo+cetuximab HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.67–1.21; interaction P = 0.026).

10.3390/cancers13102356,Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters Are Frequently Detected in Women with Early-Stage Breast Cancer,"Simple Summary Metastases cause the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and in particular CTC-clusters, are considered the seeds of metastasis, but their analysis in the early-stages of the disease has so far been limited by the fact that, by using conventional and epithelial-based technologies (as the FDA-approved CellSearch platform), they are more often detected in the metastatic setting. It is known, however, that cancer cells are heterogeneous and can downregulate the expression of epithelial markers, thus limiting the detection capability of epithelial-based technologies. Here, we show that it is possible to increase CTC-cluster detection by using an epithope-independent technology based on blood filtration, and in particular that this strategy allows to detect a high number of CTC-clusters in stage II-III breast cancer patients, before and during neoadjuvant treatment. Our results therefore offer a new opportunity to deepen our understanding of the cancer dissemination process in its early steps. Abstract The clinical relevance of circulating tumor cell clusters (CTC-clusters) in breast cancer (BC) has been mostly studied using the CellSearch®, a marker-dependent method detecting only epithelial-enriched clusters. However, due to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, resorting to marker-independent approaches can improve CTC-cluster detection. Blood samples collected from healthy donors and spiked-in with tumor mammospheres, or from BC patients, were processed for CTC-cluster detection with 3 technologies: CellSearch®, CellSieve™ filters, and ScreenCell® filters. In spiked-in samples, the 3 technologies showed similar recovery capability, whereas, in 19 clinical samples processed in parallel with CellSearch® and CellSieve™ filters, filtration allowed us to detect more CTC-clusters than CellSearch® (median number = 7 versus 1, p = 0.0038). Next, samples from 37 early BC (EBC) and 23 metastatic BC (MBC) patients were processed using ScreenCell® filters for attaining both unbiased enrichment and marker-independent identification (based on cytomorphological criteria). At baseline, CTC-clusters were detected in 70% of EBC cases and in 20% of MBC patients (median number = 2, range 0–20, versus 0, range 0–15, p = 0.0015). Marker-independent approaches for CTC-cluster assessment improve detection and show that CTC-clusters are more frequent in EBC than in MBC patients, a novel finding suggesting that dissemination of CTC-clusters is an early event in BC natural history.",2021.0,2021-05-01,32,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001162df15fc67278c7116c49260054819e5f6db

10.1039/d3ay01040f,"A new modality for cholesterol impact tracking in colon cancer development - Raman imaging, fluorescence and AFM studies combined with chemometric analysis.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking, high consumption of red or processed meat and a diet with low fibre, fruit, and vegetable intake increase CRC risk. Despite advances in surgery (the basic treatment for recovery), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, CRC remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Therefore the social importance of this problem stimulates research aimed at developing new tools for rapid CRC diagnosis and analysis of CRC risk factors. Considering the association between the cholesterol level and CRC, we hypothesize that cholesterol spectroscopic and AFM (atomic force microscopy) studies combined with chemometric analysis can be new, powerful tools used to visualize the cholesterol distribution, estimate cholesterol content and determine its influence on the biochemical and nanomechanical properties of colon cells. Our paper presents the analysis of human colon tissues: normal and cancer and human colon single cells normal CCD18-Co and cancer CaCo-2 in the physiological state and CaCo-2 upon mevastatin supplementation. Based on vibrational features we have shown that Raman spectroscopy and imaging allow cholesterol content in human colon tissues and human colon single cells of both types to be tracked and allow the effectiveness of mevastatin in the mevalonate pathway modulation and disruption of the cholesterol level to be proven. All observations have been confirmed by chemometric analysis including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA). The positive impact of statins on cholesterol content has also been studied by using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A significant increase in Young modulus as a mechanomarker for CaCo-2 human cancer colon cells upon mevastatin supplementation compared to CCD18-Co human normal colon cells was observed. This paper is one of the first reports about the use of Raman spectroscopic techniques in cholesterol investigations and the first one about cholesterol investigation using Raman spectroscopy (RS) on human cells ex vivo in the context of colon cancer development.",2023.0,2023-10-02,6,21,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011806597270ea198358e399f57c4588a6aa6a3

10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.8.2343,"Quality of Actions to Control Cervical Cancer in Bahia, Brazil","Objective: To assess the quality of the actions to control cervical cancer (CC) and its correlates. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted from January to March 2019 in 19 municipalities in Bahia, Brazil, with a sample of 241 doctors and nurses from primary health care (PHC). Three dependent variables were chosen- “Performance of educational, promotion, prevention, and monitoring actions” (D1); “Access to diagnostic tests” (D2); “Non-occurrence of high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL)” (D3). Poisson regression with robust variance was used, adopting hierarchical input variables to estimate the prevalence ratios and confidence intervals of 95%. Results: The following prevalence rates were found: D1 39.8% (95% CI: 33.8-46.2); D2 73.9% (95% CI: 67.9-79.1); and D3 46.4% (95% CI: 39.9-53.0). These dimensions remained associated with the dependent variables: D1- having professional training courses on the topic; consideration to ensure that collection takes place appropriately by a professional; and women having access to medical transport; D2- nurses treating low-grade lesions; D3- recording the Papanicolaou in electronic medical records; D1 and D2- professionals joining the service through public tender; D1 and D3- working in the PHC (≥ 2 years); D2 and D3- recording Papanicolaou in physical records; and performance of Papanicolaou by residents. Conclusion: Better trained professionals and professionals working in stable work arrangements are associated with comprehensive actions to control CC. Such strategies indicate that investments in work management result in a more organized PHC and more solution-centered work processes. Therefore, working in the PHC for a longer time and nurses performing more clinical actions (collection and treatment) are favored by such organizational actions. Investments in diagnostic support contribute to perceptions of more comprehensive actions to control CC.",2021.0,2021-08-01,1,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011967cdb1ae5b74148aec4c757e6aee106d7df

10.1371/journal.pone.0282180,When can cancer patient treatment nonadherence be considered intentional or unintentional? A scoping review,"Background Treatment nonadherence in cancer patients remains high with most interventions having had limited success. Most studies omit the multi-factorial aspects of treatment adherence and refer to medication adherence. The behaviour is rarely defined as intentional or unintentional. Aim The aim of this Scoping Review is to increase understanding of modifiable factors in treatment nonadherence through the relationships that physicians have with their patients. This knowledge can help define when treatment nonadherence is intentional or unintentional and can assist in predicting cancer patients at risk of nonadherence and in intervention design. The scoping review provides the basis for method triangulation in two subsequent qualitative studies: 1. Sentiment analysis of online cancer support groups in relation to treatment nonadherence; 2. A qualitative validation survey to refute / or validate claims from this scoping review. Thereafter, framework development for a future (cancer patient) online peer support intervention. Methods A Scoping Review was performed to identify peer reviewed studies that concern treatment / medication nonadherence in cancer patients—published between 2000 to 2021 (and partial 2022). The review was registered in the Prospero database CRD42020210340 and follows the PRISMA-S: an extension to the PRISMA Statement for Reporting Literature Searches in Systematic Searches. The principles of meta-ethnography are used in a synthesis of qualitative findings that preserve the context of primary data. An aim of meta-ethnography is to identify common and refuted themes across studies. This is not a mixed methods study, but due to a limited qualitativevidence base and to broaden findings, the qualitative elements (author interpretations) found within relevant quantitative studies have been included. Results Of 7510 articles identified, 240 full texts were reviewed with 35 included. These comprise 15 qualitative and 20 quantitative studies. One major theme, that embraces 6 sub themes has emerged: ‘Physician factors can influence patient factors in treatment nonadherence’. The six (6) subthemes are: 1. Suboptimal Communication; 2. The concept of Information differs between Patient and Physician; 3.Inadequate time. 4. The need for Treatment Concordance is vague or missing from concepts; 5. The importance of Trust in the physician / patient relationship is understated in papers; 6. Treatment concordance as a concept is rarely defined and largely missing from studies. Line of argument was drawn Treatment (or medication) nonadherence that is intentional or unintentional is often attributed to patient factors—with far less attention to the potential influence of physician communication factors. The differentation between intentional or unintentional nonadherence is missing from most qualitative and quantitative studies. The holistic inter-dimensional / multi-factorial concept of ‘treatment adherence’ receives scant attention. The main focus is on medication adherence / nonadherence in the singular context. Nonadherence that is unintentional is not necessarily passive behaviour and may overlap with intentional nonadherence. The absence of treatment concordance is a barrier to treatment adherence and is rarely articulated or defined in studies. Conclusion This review demonstrates how cancer patient treatment nonadherence is often a shared outcome. An equal focus on physican and patient factors can increase understanding of the two main types of nonadherence (intentional or unintentional). This differentation should help improve the fundamentals of intervention design.",2023.0,2023-05-03,0,119,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011e1eccabd0cb8b6b0e134335f49334114e3c3
10.1371/journal.pone.0118187,"Vasoactivity of Rucaparib, a PARP-1 Inhibitor, is a Complex Process that Involves Myosin Light Chain Kinase, P2 Receptors, and PARP Itself","Therapeutic inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), as monotherapy or to supplement the potencies of other agents, is a promising strategy in cancer treatment. We previously reported that the first PARP inhibitor to enter clinical trial, rucaparib (AG014699), induced vasodilation in vivo in xenografts, potentiating response to temozolomide. We now report that rucaparib inhibits the activity of the muscle contraction mediator myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) 10-fold more potently than its commercially available inhibitor ML-9. Moreover, rucaparib produces additive relaxation above the maximal degree achievable with ML-9, suggesting that MLCK inhibition is not solely responsible for dilation. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis using L-NMMA also failed to impact rucaparib’s activity. Rucaparib contains the nicotinamide pharmacophore, suggesting it may inhibit other NAD+-dependent processes. NAD+ exerts P2 purinergic receptor-dependent inhibition of smooth muscle contraction. Indiscriminate blockade of the P2 purinergic receptors with suramin abrogated rucaparib-induced vasodilation in rat arterial tissue without affecting ML-9-evoked dilation, although the specific receptor subtypes responsible have not been unequivocally identified. Furthermore, dorsal window chamber and real time tumor vessel perfusion analyses in PARP-1-/- mice indicate a potential role for PARP in dilation of tumor-recruited vessels. Finally, rucaparib provoked relaxation in 70% of patient-derived tumor-associated vessels. These data provide tantalising evidence of the complexity of the mechanism underlying rucaparib-mediated vasodilation.",2015.0,2015-02-17,19,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0011e54cd15d283d4527f41e399c98f477769181

10.3892/mmr.2019.10853,Expression profile of Toll-like receptors in human breast cancer,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most widely studied pattern recognition receptors. Mounting evidence suggests an important association between TLRs and the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Thus, targeting these receptors may be a potential strategy for breast cancer treatment. The current study analyzed the data of 1,215 patients with breast cancer obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. It was observed that, in addition to TLR6, TLR7 and TLR8, the expression of the remaining TLRs in breast cancer tissues was lower than that in normal tissues. In addition, TLR3 and TLR9 displayed significantly different expression levels in ER-/PR-negative breast cancer compared with the control tissues, while TLR5 expression was significantly reduced in HER2-enriched breast cancer. Furthermore, TLR10 exhibited lower expression levels in advanced stages of the disease as compared with that observed in earlier stages. Survival analysis revealed that the expression of TLR4 and TLR7 had a significant impact on survival, and higher expression levels suggested worse prognosis. Finally, the expression levels of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR10 were correlated with those of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, while the expression levels of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 were correlated with those of interferon-β and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10. Taken together, the current study results suggest that TLR expression may serve as a biomarker of cancer pathogenesis and progression, and may provide new insights for the treatment of breast cancer through the regulation and targeting of TLRs.",2019.0,2019-11-26,50,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001280d123501458e3d705964c4be55a0ccc67dc

The aim of this study was to record the current practices of Greek gastroenterologists in the screening and treatment of H. pylori infection. Method An anonymous questionnaire consisting of 19 questions about the management of H. pylori infection was sent with the aid of the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology to all members of the Society. Results The questionnaire was completed by 180 gastroenterologists, with a response rate of 31.4%. Diagnostic tests to confirm H. pylori infection are ordered by >90% of the gastroenterologists for patients with current peptic ulcer disease, gastric lymphoma, family history of gastric cancer, and an endoscopic appearance suggestive of gastritis. Most gastroenterologists (55.8%) also tested for H. pylori in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Histopathology was the most preferred (60.6%) method when testing was decided during endoscopy, while urea breath test was the most preferred method (67.8%) regardless of endoscopy. Most gastroenterologists use quadruple eradication regimens supported by international guidelines (90%), while 65.6% of the physicians answered that they systematically recommend the addition of probiotics to standard therapy. Most physicians (82.8%) answered that they always confirm the eradication of the pathogen. Conclusions The majority of Greek gastroenterologists conform to the recommendations of international guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of H. pylori infection, except for the screening of patients with GERD.

Aims: To grade the breast carcinoma on FNAC using Robinson grading system and to assess the concordance of cytological grading (CG) with histological grading (HG) using Elston-Ellis modification of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading system. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted for 1-year, comprising of 50 female patients attending outpatient departments (OPD) as well as admitted in various surgical wards of a teaching hospital, diagnosed as breast carcinoma. FNAC smears were stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa and Papanicolaou (Pap) stains and CG was done using Robinson system on Pap stained smears. The results were compared with HG system after resection of tumors. Results: Of 50 cases, 14 (28%) cases were graded as grade I, 24 (48%) grade II, and 12 (24%) grade III by CG, whereas 9 (18%), 28 (56%) and 13 (26%) cases were graded as grade I, II and III by HG. The result showed overall 72% concordance of CG with HG, with grade II and grade III showing highest degree of concordance (83.33%), which is comparable to previous studies. Kappa measurement showed a higher degree of agreement in high-grade tumors compared with low-grade tumors (0.73 in grade III, 0.53 in grade II and 0.39 in grade I). Conclusion: Cytological grading is comparable to HG in majority of cases. Because neoadjuvant chemotherapy is becoming increasingly popular as primary treatment modality of breast cancer, CG could be a useful parameter in selecting the mode of therapy and predicting tumor behavior.",2015.0,2015-01-01,24,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001338173b1e59c0e996ce2db1c27439405a0974

The recognition of pulmonary toxicity related to cancer therapy has become increasingly critical, for which interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common cause of mortality. Cancer therapy-related ILD (CT-ILD) can result from a variety of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody–drug conjugates, and radiotherapy. CT-ILD may progress rapidly and even be life-threatening; therefore, prompt diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial for effective management. This review aims to provide valuable information on the risk factors associated with CT-ILD; elucidate its underlying mechanisms; discuss its clinical features, imaging, and histological manifestations; and emphasize the clinical-related views of its diagnosis. In addition, this review provides an overview of grading, typing, and staging treatment strategies used for the management of CT-ILD.",2024.0,2024-10-11,1,153,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0013c635bffb4ca7b1ae4f6473b1179c0ad69e36
10.3390/cancers15010017,Targeting mTORC1 Activity to Improve Efficacy of Radioligand Therapy in Cancer,"Simple Summary Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) delivers cancer-selective radiopharmaceuticals to eradicate cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. The recent development of combinatory treatments is a growing research field in nuclear medicine to enhance cancer cytotoxicity of TRT. Among promising combinatorial strategies, this review focuses on the rationale, efficacy, and safety of targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) to improve systemic radiation with radiolabeled ligands in cancer patients. Abstract Radioligand therapy (RLT) represents an effective strategy to treat malignancy by cancer-selective delivery of radioactivity following systemic application. Despite recent therapeutic successes, cancer radioresistance and insufficient delivery of the radioactive ligands, as well as cytotoxicity to healthy organs, significantly impairs clinical efficacy. To improve disease management while minimizing toxicity, in recent years, the combination of RLT with molecular targeted therapies against cancer signaling networks showed encouraging outcomes. Characterization of the key deregulated oncogenic signaling pathways revealed their convergence to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in which signaling plays an essential role in the regulation of cancer growth and survival. Therapeutic interference with hyperactivated mTOR pathways was extensively studied and led to the development of mTOR inhibitors for clinical applications. In this review, we outline the regulation and oncogenic role of mTOR signaling, as well as recapitulate and discuss mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibition to improve the efficacy of RLT in cancer.",2022.0,2022-12-20,1,94,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0013d08fd7060ff29b728bfcd2198cef69106341
10.7150/jca.23427,Histone methylation in DNA repair and clinical practice: new findings during the past 5-years,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic lesions that can impair cellular homeostasis and genome stability to result in tumorigenesis for inappropriate repair. Although DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), the related mechanisms are still incompletely unclear. Indeed, more and more evidences indicate that the methylation of histone lysine has an important role in choosing the pathways of DNA repair. For example, tri-methylated H3K36 is required for HR repair, while di-methylated H4K20 can recruit 53BP1 for NHEJ repair. Here, we reviewed the recent progress in the molecular mechanisms by which histone methylation functions in DNA double-strand breaks repair (DSBR). The insight into the mechanisms of histone methylation repairing DNA damage will supply important cues for clinical cancer treatment.",2018.0,2018-05-24,49,101,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0013dccfdf69c1a02d933f5368d216dffb4325de

10.1200/JGO.2015.002980,Patient-Reported Burden of a Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) Diagnosis: Results From the First Global Survey of Patients With NETs,"Purpose Despite the considerable impact of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) on patients’ daily lives, the journey of the patient with a NET has rarely been documented, with published data to date being limited to small qualitative studies. NETs are heterogeneous malignancies with nonspecific symptomology, leading to extensive health care use and diagnostic delays that affect survival. A large, international patient survey was conducted to increase understanding of the experience of the patient with a NET and identify unmet needs, with the aim of improving disease awareness and care worldwide. Methods An anonymous, self-reported survey was conducted (online or on paper) from February to May 2014, recruiting patients with NETs from > 12 countries as a collaboration between the International Neuroendocrine Cancer Alliance and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Survey questions captured information on sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, NET diagnostic experience, disease impact/management, interaction with medical teams, NET knowledge/awareness, and sources of information. This article reports the most relevant findings on patient experience with NETs and the impact of NETs on health care system resources. Results A total of 1,928 patients with NETs participated. A NET diagnosis had a substantially negative impact on patients’ personal and work lives. Patients reported delayed diagnosis and extensive NET-related health care resource use. Patients desired improvement in many aspects of NET care, including availability of a wider range of NET-specific treatment options, better access to NET experts or specialist centers, and a more knowledgeable, better-coordinated/-aligned NET medical team. Conclusion This global patient-reported survey demonstrates the considerable burden of NETs with regard to symptoms, work and daily life, and health care resource use, and highlights considerable unmet needs. Further intervention is required to improve the patient experience among those with NETs.",2016.0,2016-06-08,125,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0013e7a658b87df2d002e0ae17f2a59d8e6bd3eb
10.1177/03946320231211795,Identification and development of TP53 mutation-associated Long non-coding RNAs signature for optimized prognosis assessment and treatment selection in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Background The TP53 gene is estimated to be mutated in over 50% of tumors, with the majority of tumors exhibiting abnormal TP53 signaling pathways. However, the exploration of TP53 mutation-related LncRNAs in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains incomplete. This study aims to identify such LncRNAs and enhance the prognostic accuracy for Hepatoma patients. Material and Methods Differential gene expression was identified using the “limma” package in R. Prognosis-related LncRNAs were identified via univariate Cox regression analysis, while a prognostic model was crafted using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan–Meier curves. The precision of the prognostic model was assessed through ROC analysis. Subsequently, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm were executed on the TCGA dataset via the TIDE database. Fractions of 24 types of immune cell infiltration were obtained from NCI Cancer Research Data Commons using deconvolution techniques. The protein expression levels encoded by specific genes were obtained through the TPCA database. Results In this research, we have identified 85 LncRNAs associated with TP53 mutations and developed a corresponding signature referred to as TP53MLncSig. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed a lower 3-year survival rate in high-risk patients (46.9%) compared to low-risk patients (74.2%). The accuracy of the prognostic TP53MLncSig was further evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC curve. The analysis yielded a 5-year ROC score of 0.793, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, a higher score for TP53MLncSig was found to be associated with an increased response rate to immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy (p = .005). Patients possessing high-risk classification exhibited lower levels of P53 protein expression and higher levels of genomic instability. Conclusion The present study aimed to identify and validate LncRNAs associated with TP53 mutations. We constructed a prognostic model that can predict chemosensitivity and response to ICB therapy in HCC patients. This novel approach sheds light on the role of LncRNAs in TP53 mutation and provides valuable resources for analyzing patient prognosis and treatment selection.",2023.0,2023-11-01,2,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001413d341dfe21f244e562378e6482d8b904dac

While they are the subject of ongoing investigation, surgery remains the definitive modality for oncological resection. Esophagectomy, however, is traditionally a challenging surgical procedure and carries a significant incidence of morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are considerably less invasive alternatives to esophagectomy in the diagnosis and treatment of high grade dysplasia, early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. However, many early esophageal cancer patients, with favorable histology, who could benefit from endoscopic resection, are referred for formal esophagectomy due to lesion characteristics such as unfavorable lesion morphology or recurrence after previous endoscopic resection. In this study we present a novel, hybrid thoracoscopic transgastric endoluminal segmental esophagectomy with primary anastomosis for the potential treatment of high grade dysplasia and early esophageal cancer in a porcine ex vivo model as a proposed bridge between endoscopic resection and the relatively high mortality and morbidity formal esophagectomy procedure. The novel technique consists of thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization in addition to transgastric endoluminal segmental esophagectomy and anastomosis utilizing a standard circular stapler. The technique was found feasible in all experimental subjects. The minimally invasive nature of this novel procedure as well as the utility of basic surgical equipment and surgical skill is an important attribute of this method and can potentially make it a treatment option for many patients who would otherwise be referred for a formal esophagectomy.",2021.0,2021-07-01,0,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00142ad8cc23c9fc86e0cd274b723bc06cd0ee2b

10.3892/etm.2017.5505,Combination therapy of hTERTR and FAM96A for hepatocellular carcinoma through enhancing apoptosis sensitivity,"Avoidance of apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs is an essential factor of carcinogenesis and a hallmark of resistance to cancer therapy. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase receptor (hTERTR) is a potential anti-cancer agent for inhibiting tumor growth. Family with sequence similarity 96 member A (FAM96A) is a ubiquitous, conserved protein and possesses apoptosome-activating and pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor potential in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, hTERTR and FAM96A were identified as efficient anti-cancer agents for activating apoptosomes and reducing tumor growth. The potential tumor suppressor function of combination treatment with hTERTR and FAM96A in HCC was also investigated. hTERTR and FAM96A proteins were expressed by genetic engineering and their anti-cancer function was explored in vitro and in vivo. Effects of hTERTR and FAM96A on improvement of apoptotic sensitivity and inhibition of migration and invasion were examined in cancer cells and in a mouse model. The present results demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of hTERTR and FAM96A were effective for inhibiting tumor growth and inducing apoptosis of HCC cells in H22-bearing nude mice compared with single agent treatment. hTERTR and FAM96A were found to bind with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase, which enhanced the apoptosis of tumor cells and apoptosis sensitivity. In addition, hTERTR and FAM96A therapy enhanced cytotoxic effects by cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, interferon-γ release, T lymphocytes infiltration and apoptosis on tumor cells. Furthermore, hTERTR and FAM96A protein inhibited tumor growth in HCC mice. In conclusion, the present findings suggested that combination therapy with hTERTR and FAM96A may serve as novel tumor suppressor agents.",2017.0,2017-11-13,4,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0014e63fab702ca4adfb0e2a12a41738d25dc98a

The efficacy of second‐line VEGFR‐2 inhibition with ramucirumab (RAM) plus chemotherapy after progression to immunochemotherapy remains unclear. Medical records of patients with aGEC enrolled in the randomized phase II AIO‐STO‐0417 trial after treatment failure to first‐line FOLFOX plus nivolumab and ipilimumab were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups based on second‐line therapy: RAM plus chemotherapy (RAM group) or treatment without RAM (control group). Eighty three patients were included. In the overall population, progression‐free survival (PFS) in the RAM group was superior to the control (4.5 vs 2.9 months). Responders (CR/PR) to first‐line immunochemotherapy receiving RAM containing second‐line therapy had prolonged OS from start of first‐line therapy (28.9 vs 16.5 months), as well as second‐line OS (9.6 vs 7.5 months), PFS (5.6 vs 2.9 months) and DCR (53% vs 29%) compared to the control. PD‐L1 CPS ≥1 was 42% and 44% for the RAM and the control, respectively. Patients with CPS ≥1 in the RAM group showed better tumor control (ORR 25% vs 10%) and improved survival (total OS 11.5 vs 8.0 months; second‐line OS 6.5 vs 3.9 months; PFS 4.5 vs 1.6 months) compared to the control.

10.1093/jncics/pkae123,Physical activity and incident cardiovascular disease in breast cancer survivors: the Pathways Study,"Abstract Background Breast cancer survivors experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than women without breast cancer, due in part to cardiotoxic cancer treatments and shared lifestyle risk factors. Physical activity is associated with lower mortality risk in breast cancer survivors, but associations with CVD have not been examined in detail. Methods The Pathways Study is a prospective cohort study of 4504 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2005 and 2013. At enrollment, women self-reported their physical activities during the previous 6 months, which were dichotomized as meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (≥150 minutes of moderate-intensity or ≥75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week) vs not. Incident CVD events (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, ischemic heart disease, stroke) occurring between enrollment and December 2021 were identified from electronic health records. Covariate-adjusted, competing-risks Cox regression models estimated associations between meeting physical activity guidelines and CVD risk. Results Compared with women who did not meet physical activity guidelines at their diagnosis, those who did had a 25% lower risk of CVD (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.94). Among the individual CVD outcomes, meeting physical activity guidelines was protective against incident cardiomyopathy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.95), heart failure (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.87), and cardiac arrest (HR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.99). Conclusions Meeting physical activity guidelines at breast cancer diagnosis was associated with lower risk of CVD after diagnosis.

This area is currently of high research interest and holds the potential to become a non-invasive and effective tool in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases. The objective of this study is to explore the hotspots and trends in the field of fluorescence imaging technology applications in pancreatic diseases from 2003 to 2023 through bibliometric and visual analysis. Methods This study utilized the Web of Science (core collection) to identify publications related to the application of fluorescence imaging technology in pancreatic diseases from 2003 to 2023. Tools such as CiteSpace (V 6.2.R6), VOSviewer (v1.6.20), and R Studio (Bibliometrix: R-tool version 4.1.4) were employed to analyze various dimensions including publication count, countries, institutions, journals, authors, co-cited references, keywords, burst words, and references. Results A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 913 papers published from January 1, 2003, to December 1, 2023, on the application of fluorescence imaging technology in pancreatic diseases. The number of publications in this field has rapidly increased, with the United States being the central hub. The University of California, San Diego emerged as the most active institution. “Biomaterials” was identified as the most influential journal.

10.3390/jcm13164942,A Narrative Review of the Association between Dental Abnormalities and Chemotherapy,"Dental abnormalities are often detected in childhood and are reported to occur with high prevalence in patients who have undergone cancer treatment or chemotherapy. We performed a literature search of PubMed from 2004 to 2024 using the terms “dental anomaly” and “panoramic examination”, and 298 potentially relevant articles were found. Thirty-one articles about dental abnormalities matched the eligibility criteria and were extracted for this review. Although the prevalence of tooth agenesis and microdontia in the general population was reported to be approximately 10% and 3%, respectively, the prevalence in patients who had undergone cancer treatment or chemotherapy was higher in all surveys, suggesting that the treatment is related to the occurrence of dental abnormalities.

10.3389/fonc.2022.1013806,PD-L1 is associated with the prognosis of penile cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Previous studies have explored the role of PD-L1 in the survival outcomes of penile cancer patients with controversies existed. Thus, the meta-analysis was conducted to report and review the association between PD-L1 and survival in penile cancer patients. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were all searched, screened, and reviewed by June 1, 2022. Hazard ratio (HR) was used to evaluate the relationship between PD-L1 and survival outcome, and odds ratio (OR) was for tumor features. Results Nine retrospective studies (1,003 patients) were incorporated. The prevalence of PD-L1 in patients with penile cancer was 51.4% (95% CI = 42.1%-60.8%, I 2 = 88.5%). Higher PD-L1 on tumor cells was related to shorter cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients (HR = 1.578, 95% CI = 1.227-2.029, I 2 = 23.3%), but had no associations with overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.123, 95% CI = 0.511-2.465, I 2 = 0.0%). Subgroup analysis indicated that higher PD-L1 was related to shorter CSS in Caucasus (HR = 1.827, 95% CI = 1.355-2.465, I 2 = 0.0%) only. Furthermore, PD-L1 had associations with tumor stage (pT1 vs. pT2-4, OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.346-0.667, P = 0.001) and tumor grade (Well and moderate vs. Poor, OR = 0.377, 95% CI = 0.264-0.538, P < 0.001). PD-L1 positivity was also related to lymph node (LN) status (pN0/NX vs. pN1–3, OR = 0.541, 95% CI = 0.385-0.759, P = 0.001) and HPV status (Positive vs. Negative, OR = 0.510, 95% CI = 0.322-0.810, P = 0.003). A trend toward statistical significance between PD-L1 and histological types was also observed (Usual SCC vs. Others, OR = 1.754, 95% CI = 0.984-3.124, P = 0.070). Conclusions PD-L1 over-expression was related to worse survival outcomes and several clinicopathological features of penile cancer. PD-L1 expression can be applied to select appropriate treatment strategies for penile malignancies.

10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0734,"Pharmacologic Inhibitor of DNA-PK, M3814, Potentiates Radiotherapy and Regresses Human Tumors in Mouse Models","Physical and chemical DNA-damaging agents are used widely in the treatment of cancer. Double-strand break (DSB) lesions in DNA are the most deleterious form of damage and, if left unrepaired, can effectively kill cancer cells. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a critical component of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), one of the two major pathways for DSB repair. Although DNA-PK has been considered an attractive target for cancer therapy, the development of pharmacologic DNA-PK inhibitors for clinical use has been lagging. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable DNA-PK inhibitor, M3814 (peposertib), and provide in vivo proof of principle for DNA-PK inhibition as a novel approach to combination radiotherapy. M3814 potently inhibits DNA-PK catalytic activity and sensitizes multiple cancer cell lines to ionizing radiation (IR) and DSB-inducing agents. Inhibition of DNA-PK autophosphorylation in cancer cells or xenograft tumors led to an increased number of persistent DSBs. Oral administration of M3814 to two xenograft models of human cancer, using a clinically established 6-week fractionated radiation schedule, strongly potentiated the antitumor activity of IR and led to complete tumor regression at nontoxic doses. Our results strongly support DNA-PK inhibition as a novel approach for the combination radiotherapy of cancer.

TNBC’s heterogeneity poses challenges to immunological treatments, inducing resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic modalities, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4, are explored in preclinical and clinical trials. Promising results emerge from combining ICIs with anti-TGF-β and VISTA, hindering TNBC tumor growth. TNBC cells employ complex evasion strategies involving interactions with stromal and immune cells, suppressing immune recognition through various cytokines, chemokines, and metabolites. The recent focus on unraveling humoral and cellular components aims to disrupt cancer crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment.

10.3390/ijms23031861,Theranostic Interpolation of Genomic Instability in Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is a diverse disease caused by mutations in multiple genes accompanying epigenetic aberrations of hazardous genes and protein pathways, which distress tumor-suppressor genes and the expression of oncogenes. Alteration in any of the several physiological mechanisms such as cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair machinery, mitotic checkpoints, and telomere maintenance results in genomic instability. Theranostic has the potential to foretell and estimate therapy response, contributing a valuable opportunity to modify the ongoing treatments and has developed new treatment strategies in a personalized manner. “Omics” technologies play a key role while studying genomic instability in breast cancer, and broadly include various aspects of proteomics, genomics, metabolomics, and tumor grading. Certain computational techniques have been designed to facilitate the early diagnosis of cancer and predict disease-specific therapies, which can produce many effective results. Several diverse tools are used to investigate genomic instability and underlying mechanisms. The current review aimed to explore the genomic landscape, tumor heterogeneity, and possible mechanisms of genomic instability involved in initiating breast cancer. We also discuss the implications of computational biology regarding mutational and pathway analyses, identification of prognostic markers, and the development of strategies for precision medicine. We also review different technologies required for the investigation of genomic instability in breast cancer cells, including recent therapeutic and preventive advances in breast cancer.",2022.0,2022-02-01,8,182,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00178866e7aef9b3d4331470ba156234f714813f

In this study, we have shown the influence of a new palladium-based anticancer agent in contrast to the six distinct prostate cancer lines and the primary cultures. Methods In this study, we have used six distinct prostate cell lines, that is, PNT2-C2, LNCaP, BPH-1, PC-3, PNT1A, and P4E6. The MTP and ATP assay were performed to evaluate the growth of the cell and the flow cytometry to investigate the status of the cell cycle. The antigrowth effect of the palladium complex was evaluated against different cell lines at three time zones 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. [PdCl(terpy)] (capsule)-2H2O is synthesized by direct encapsulation of equimolar amounts of capsule ions into [Pd (terpy) Cl] Cl-2H2O. Results A comparative analysis was done on 25 mM etoposide and 12 mM cisplatin, cytotoxic agents. The lowest IC50 value at 72 hours was 0.128 mM for BPH-1 cell lines with 0.139 mM, whereas PNT2-C2 cells were found to be most resistant with IC50 values of 0.829 mM. The antigrowth effect of palladium complex on cell lines was measured using the MTS assay at 24, 48, and 72 hours. BPH-1, PNT2-C2, and PNT1A either possess normal tissues or have benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues whereas P4E6, PC-3, and LNCaP cell lines possess malignant origin. The Pd complex exhibited significant cytotoxic action in stem cells when compared against etoposide. An antigrowth effect was reported for Pd complex at lower concentration, but it was more cytotoxic than etoposide with significant cytotoxicity (P=0.001). Conclusion The palladium complex experienced a substantial antigrowth influence over most of the prostate tumor cell lines and the primary cultures, eventually, leading to the implementation of this Pd complex in the treating procedure of metastatic prostate cancer, which is tremendously resistant to the traditional treatment.",2022.0,2022-03-19,3,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0017df4c9ed31e014fb12b76a903a76824f586c8

Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage III–IV (7th edition) HNSCC were prospectively enrolled on an IRB-approved study to undergo two pre-treatment baseline DW-MRI examinations, performed 1 week apart, and a third early intra-treatment DW-MRI examination during the second week of chemoradiation. Forty texture and six histogram features were derived from ADC maps. Repeatability of the features from the baseline ADC maps was assessed with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared average baseline and early treatment feature changes. Data from nine patients were used for this study. Comparison of the two baseline ADC maps yielded 11 features with an ICC ≥ 0.80, indicating that these features had excellent repeatability: Run Gray-Level Non-Uniformity, Coarseness, Long Zone High Gray-Level, Variance (Histogram Feature), Cluster Shade, Long Zone, Variance (Texture Feature), Run Length Non-Uniformity, Correlation, Cluster Tendency, and ADC Median. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test resulted in four features with significantly different early treatment-induced changes compared to the baseline values: Run Gray-Level Non-Uniformity (p = 0.005), Run Length Non-Uniformity (p = 0.005), Coarseness (p = 0.006), and Variance (Histogram) (p = 0.006).

Although MRI, PET, CT, and MRS have shown some capabilities in differentiating these conditions, there is still a considerable need for the emergence of state-of-the-art techniques to assist field professionals. Here, we introduce radiomics, a process that extracts many features from medical images using data characterization algorithms and a promising tool to differentiate these scenarios. The results could significantly impact patients’ care by enhancing the understanding and accuracy of post-treatment follow-ups in brain cancer patients. Abstract Glioma and glioblastoma multiform (GBM) remain among the most debilitating and life-threatening brain tumors. Despite advances in diagnosing approaches, patient follow-up after treatment (surgery and chemoradiation) is still challenging for differentiation between tumor progression/recurrence, pseudoprogression, and radionecrosis. Radiomics emerges as a promising tool in initial diagnosis, grading, and survival prediction in patients with glioma and can help differentiate these post-treatment scenarios. Preliminary published studies are promising about the role of radiomics in post-treatment glioma/GBM. However, this field faces significant challenges, including a lack of evidence-based solid data, scattering publication, heterogeneity of studies, and small sample sizes. The present review explores radiomics’s capabilities in following patients with glioma/GBM status post-treatment and to differentiate tumor progression, recurrence, pseudoprogression, and radionecrosis.",2023.0,2023-09-01,10,125,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0018535f7bb4b4af77cef97f73e09269cd564841

Heterotopic pregnancy is very rare in natural conception (1/10000-1/30000 pregnancies) [1, 4], but it is most common in couples who conceive with assisted reproductive procedures like IVF as many as 1/3900 pregnancies [2], and there are cases of heterotopic interstitial pregnancy [3, 5], a high index of suspicious can help in timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention. A woman experiencing a heterotopic pregnancy may or may not have symptoms. This is especially concerning since half of these pregnancies only diagnosed when the fallopian tube ruptures. If symptoms are present, they may include: abnormal vaginal bleeding, mild to severe abdominal pain or cramping, dizziness, fainting, nausea and vomiting and bloating. Diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy is very difficult in its early stages, women may have vaginal bleeding and cramping, but these are symptoms that occur in a normal pregnancy, at the same time it is easy to miss a heterotopic pregnancy during a routine ultrasound since the technician may only check the developing fetus intrauterine. If there is a suspicion of a heterotopic pregnancy, it usually is only by week four or five that it can be confirmed or to ruled out by ultrasound. This study was a case report of a 25-year-old woman with a heterotopic pregnancy. Patient Information A 25-year-old pregnant woman (G1 P0) with abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting was admitted on 12 March 2018 in Firoozgar hospital. Based on the last menstrual period (LMP) of 12 January, gestational age was 8 weeks and 3 days. She was pregnant without the use of any drugs for induction of ovulation. By ultrasound examination, an intrauterine gestational sac with a sub chorionic hematoma 30mm in its periphery was visible. Gestational age based on Crown-rump length (CRL) of 22mm was 9 weeks with fetal heart rate (FHR) and yolk sac and a fetus in left adnexa had CRL of 21mm or 8 weeks and 6 days without FHR. In the periphery of the adnexal sac was the collection 62×58×68mm (left hematosalpinx). There was moderate fluid in the pelvis and peritoneal cavity (Figure 1). Because of acute abdomen and high suspicious of heterotopic pregnancy laparotomy was performed and in the peritoneal cavity was 1000cc blood and 500cc clot in around of left adnexa and in cul-de-sac .left fallopian tube was ruptured and bleeding. Left salpingectomy and peritoneal washing were performed (Figure 2). A 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection was prescribed before surgery and then weekly until tenth weeks of pregnancy. The ultrasound in the day after surgery showed a viable fetus. In the pathology report left tubal pregnancy was confirmed. Figure 1) The ultrasound examination reveals simultaneous intra and extra uterine pregnancy Figure 2) Left tubal pregnancy Discussion Heterotopic pregnancy is very rare, although its prevalence has probably increased due to the emergence of assisted reproductive technology (ART). The patient, in this case, was pregnant spontaneously. Diagnosis of this condition is difficult due to the existence of the intrauterine gestational sac. The most frequent danger lies in the non-recognition of the condition and subsequent rupture of the fallopian tube. 135                                                                                                                                                     Forough Javanmanesh and Mina Moeini Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Cancer Research                                                                     Summer 2018, Volume 3, Issue 3 A few case reports have described the treatment of heterotopic cesarean scar viable pregnancies or bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancies [10] with local injection of potassium chloride. This method is commonly used for fetal reduction in multiple pregnancies [6-8], but in our cases expectant or medical management because of the diagnosis of acute abdomen is not feasible. However treatment with potassium chloride is associated with an increased risk of abdominal pain, pregnancy loss, excessive vaginal bleeding, prematurity, need for subsequent surgery, and spontaneous rupture of membranes and subsequent chorioamnionitis [9]. In this patient, the same as the case of Headley and Adum [11], the diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy was very soon after admission and confirmed after laparotomy and pathology result. We followed the patient and the last ultrasound examination performed in 20 August, showed a normal fetus with gestational age of 31 weeks and 5 days. Because this study was a case report, there was no limitation. Conclusion Clinicians should always consider heterotopic pregnancy in the differential diagnosis in a reproductive age patient with abdominal pain and signs or symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. A high index of suspicion for early and timely diagnosis and management with laparotomy or laparoscopy can result in a favorable successful outcome.

Expert clinical examination and histological diagnosis from biopsy is required to determine the extent and invasion of disease, which is paramount in planning of appropriate treatment. Management of loco-regional penile cancer can be divided into management of primary tumour and management of regional lymph nodes. This review article will focus on the management of the primary penile tumour with particular focus on penile sparing therapies. The aim of primary penile tumour management is to completely remove the tumour whilst preserving as much organ function as possible. Preservation of the penis is important as it allows patients to maintain urinary and sexual function, as well as quality of life. With the majority of penile cancer confined to the glans and foreskin, most penile cancers can be managed with organ-preserving therapy. A wide variety of treatment options are available, and this review aims to describe each of the options including the reported oncological and functional outcome for the different therapies for penile cancer.",2019.0,2019-03-09,5,79,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00190ad1f87d4faa781321765155fdd6552df024

Ionizing radiation therapy is the main strategy for HNSCC patients in advanced stage. Previously, HPV-positive HNSCC predict better prognosis than HPV-negative HNSCCs under radiotherapy, however its molecular mechanism is unresolved. SMG1 serves as a potential tumor suppressor in various cancers, including HNSCC. Methods The mRNAs and proteins expression of HPV E6/E7, p16, p53, DNMT1, SMG1 were detected after different treatments by qPCR and Western blot. The clone formation ability was measured in radiation dose after different treatments. Results In our study, the expression of HPV16 E6, DNA Methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) and SMG1 in head and neck carcinomas cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Forced E6 level in HPV-negative cells by overexpression plasmid promoted the expression of DNMT1, which resulted in decreased SMG1 expression. Silenced SMG1 in HPV-negative HNSCC cells elicited increased radiation sensitivity, suggesting that SMG1 may be an effective switch to regulate the effect of radiotherapy in HNSCC. Conclusion Our study indicated that DNMT1 enhances the radiosensitivity of HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas via downregulating SMG1.",2020.0,2020-05-01,10,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0019592e809d7de15fe5744f12f5bc6d3de8aa9d
10.2147/CMAR.S418116,Pseudoprogression Disease in a Patient with Small Cell Lung Cancer on Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy,"Abstract Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancers and is on the rise annually. It is characterized by low differentiation, high malignancy, and rapid growth. Consequently, treatment options are limited, and the patient’s prognosis is poor. The emergence of immunotherapy has partially improved the survival and prognosis of SCLC patients. However, a unique response known as “pseudoprogression” during immunotherapy has raised concerns. The occurrence of tumor enlargement despite a positive response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy undoubtedly affects the assessment of clinical drug efficacy and the selection of subsequent treatment strategies. In this article, we analyze a clinical case of pseudoprogression in a patient with SCLC who received immune therapy (Durvalumab). Currently, there is insufficient evidence-based medicine to guide the diagnosis, differentiation and subsequent treatment strategies for pseudoprogression in SCLC following immunotherapy. Through this case report and literature review, we aim to provide diagnostic and therapeutic insights for the clinical use of immunotherapy in advanced SCLC. Additionally, we hope that fellow readers of this article can engage in further collaborative discussions through more clinical research.",2023.0,2023-09-01,0,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001969892d3e3e653bd322f5478eabab93b37e62

10.3390/antiox11081504,Ferroptosis and Its Multifaceted Role in Cancer: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approach,"Ferroptosis, a new type of non-apoptotic cell death modality, is different from other modes of cell death and has been primarily found in tumor cells. Previous studies have reported that ferroptosis can be triggered by specific modulators (e.g., drugs, nutrients, and iron chelators), leading to increased intracellular lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and iron overload. Recent reports have shown that ferroptosis at the cellular and organism levels can prevent an inflammatory storm and cancer development. Emerging evidence suggests potential mechanisms (e.g., system Xc-, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH), and iron chelators) are involved in ferroptosis, which may mediate biological processes such as oxidative stress and iron overload to treat cancer. To date, there are at least three pathways that mediate ferroptosis in cancer cells: system Xc-/GSH/GPX4, FSP1/CoQ10/NAD(P)H, and ATG5/ATG7/NCOA4. Here, we summarize recent advances in the occurrence and development of ferroptosis in the context of cancer, the associations between ferroptosis and various modulators, and the potential mechanisms and therapeutic strategies targeting ferroptosis for the treatment of cancer.",2022.0,2022-07-31,46,139,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0019fd1ddd3c46a6d52986d8c730553959512020

10.1039/d0ra05598k,Impact of heat treatment on anti-oxidative and anti-colon cancer activities of the soluble extracts from black mulberry (Morus nigra L.) using water and ethanol–water solvents,"Black mulberry (Morus nigra L.) is an edible fruit with various health functions in the body. In this study, the lyophilized black mulberry was extracted using water and 75% (v/v) ethanol–water, respectively; afterwards, the soluble extracts were subjected to these treatments like ethanol removal, heat treatment at 100 °C for various times, or activated carbon-mediated dephenolization. The assaying results indicated that the used heat treatment led to decreased anthocyanin but increased total phenol and flavonoid contents for the water- and ethanol-extracts, while the dephenolized extracts after the heat treatment also had increased total phenol and flavonoid contents. The performed heat treatment decreased anti-oxidative activities of the water- and ethanol-extracts, resulting in reduced scavenging activities to the DPPH and hydroxyl radicals and lower reducing power for Fe(iii) ions. However, the results from cell experiments also demonstrated that the heat treatment at 100 °C for 45 min caused the water- and ethanol-extracts or dephenolized extracts with higher anti-cancer activity against human colon cancer HCT-116 cells. Overall, the heated extracts were more effective than the unheated counterparts to inhibit cell growth, alter cell morphology, generate more intracellular reactive oxygen species, enhance intracellular Ca2+ level, and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential of the cells. It is thereby concluded that the heat treatment of black mulberry might reduce its anti-oxidation but increase its anti-colon cancer effect due to the occurrence of the Maillard reaction and other unidentified reactions, which will deepen our present knowledge and provide a scientific basis to optimize storage or processing conditions of plant-based foods.",2020.0,2020-08-17,3,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001a3d720093b26cdea97ba70bf22e044f051f5e
10.3390/cancers14194869,Dose-Response Analysis Describes Particularly Rapid Repopulation of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer during Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy,"Simple Summary Divergent results from trials of dose-escalation and acceleration suggest that optimal schedules have yet to be identified for radiotherapy of inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. In this hypothesis-generating study radiation dose-response models were fitted to survival rates for 51 patient cohorts treated with schedules of varying total radiation dose, dose-per-fraction and duration. The best fit described repopulation running at 1.47 Gy/day for concurrent chemoradiotherapy and 0.30 Gy/day for radiotherapy alone and sequential chemoradiotherapy. The overall fitted tumour α/β ratio was 3.0 Gy. These findings imply that moderate hypofractionation of chemoradiation, within normal tissue toxicity limits, should be efficacious. Abstract (1) Purpose: We analysed overall survival (OS) rates following radiotherapy (RT) and chemo-RT of locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) to investigate whether tumour repopulation varies with treatment-type, and to further characterise the low α/β ratio found in a previous study. (2) Materials and methods: Our dataset comprised 2-year OS rates for 4866 NSCLC patients (90.5% stage IIIA/B) belonging to 51 cohorts treated with definitive RT, sequential chemo-RT (sCRT) or concurrent chemo-RT (cCRT) given in doses-per-fraction ≤3 Gy over 16–60 days. Progressively more detailed dose-response models were fitted, beginning with a probit model, adding chemotherapy effects and survival-limiting toxicity, and allowing tumour repopulation and α/β to vary with treatment-type and stage. Models were fitted using the maximum-likelihood technique, then assessed via the Akaike information criterion and cross-validation. (3) Results: The most detailed model performed best, with repopulation offsetting 1.47 Gy/day (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.36, 2.57 Gy/day) for cCRT but only 0.30 Gy/day (95% CI: 0.18, 0.47 Gy/day) for RT/sCRT. The overall fitted tumour α/β ratio was 3.0 Gy (95% CI: 1.6, 5.6 Gy). (4) Conclusion: The fitted repopulation rates indicate that cCRT schedule durations should be shortened to the minimum in which prescribed doses can be tolerated. The low α/β ratio suggests hypofractionation should be efficacious.",2022.0,2022-10-01,1,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001a3fca1f7608eb5ae8d09f4d6477f16d7c3f13

10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-3185,Bcl2 and Human Papilloma Virus 16 as Predictors of Outcome following Concurrent Chemoradiation for Advanced Oropharyngeal Cancer,"Purpose: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) is rapidly growing in incidence. Despite better prognosis than OPSCC associated with traditional risk factors, treatment failure still occurs in a significant proportion of patients. We had identified the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 as a marker for poor outcome in advanced OPSCC treated with concurrent chemoradiation. To determine whether Bcl2 and HPV together might further characterize treatment response, we examined whether the prognostic value of Bcl2 was independent of HPV status. Experimental Design: Pretreatment tumor biopsies from 68 OPSCC patients were tested for HPV by in situ hybridization and were immunostained for Bcl2 to evaluate relations with disease-free (DFS) and overall survival following platin-based concurrent chemoradiation. Median follow-up among surviving patients was 47 months (range, 10-131 months). Results: Bcl2 and HPV independently predicted DFS and overall survival. Hazard ratios (with 95% confidence interval) for positive versus negative status in bivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis of DFS were 6.1 (1.8-21) for Bcl2 and 0.11 (0.035-0.37) for HPV. Only 1 of 32 HPV-positive/Bcl2-negative tumors recurred. Pretreatment Bcl2 expression was specifically associated with distant metastasis; five of six distant metastases occurred in the <40% of patients whose primary tumors were Bcl2 positive. Conclusions: Independent of HPV status, pretreatment Bcl2 expression identifies a subset of OPSCC patients having increased risk of treatment failure, particularly through distant metastasis, after concurrent chemoradiation. Considering HPV and Bcl2 together should help in devising better personalized treatments for OPSCC.

10.3390/cancers14205120,A Systematic Review to Evaluate Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for Metastatic Prostate Cancer According to the COnsensus-Based Standard for the Selection of Health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) Methodology,"Simple Summary Metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) is one of the most common solid tumors in men and both the disease and the treatments affect patients’ quality of life (QoL). Patient-reported Outcome Measurements (PROMs) are important to assess the patient’s subjective experience with disease and treatment. Our aim is to appraise, compare, and summarize the psychometric properties of Patient-reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Our findings can improve patients’ care and their quality of life during treatment and the disease path. Abstract Introduction: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) represent important endpoints in metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). However, the clinically valid and accurate measurement of health-related quality of life depends on the psychometric properties of the PROMs considered. Objective: To appraise, compare, and summarize the properties of PROMs in mPCa. Evidence acquisition: We performed a review of PROMs used in RCTs, including patients with mPCa, using Medline in September 2021, according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) criteria. This systematic review is part of PIONEER (an IMI2 European network of excellence for big data in PCa). Results: The most frequently used PROMs in RCTs of patients with mPCa were the Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy—Prostate (FACT-P) (n = 18), the Brief Pain Inventory—Short Form (BPI-SF) (n = 8), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) (n = 6). A total of 283 abstracts were screened and 12 full-text studies were evaluated. A total of two, one, and two studies reported the psychometric proprieties of FACT-P, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and BPI-SF, respectively. FACT-P and BPI showed a high content validity, while BPI-SF showed a moderate content validity. FACT-P and BPI showed a high internal consistency (summarized by Cronbach’s α 0.70–0.95). Conclusions: The use of BPI and FACT-P in mPCa patients is supported by their high content validity and internal consistency. Since BPI is focused on pain assessment, we recommend FACT-P, which provides a broader assessment of QoL and wellbeing, for the clinical evaluation of mPCa patients. However, these considerations have been elaborated on in a very limited number of studies. Patient summary: In this paper, we review the psychometric properties of PROMs used with patients with mPCa to find the questionnaires that best assess patients’ QoL, in order to help professionals in their intervention and improve patients’ QoL. We recommend the use of BPI and FACT-P for their high content validity and internal consistency despite the limited number of studies considered.",2022.0,2022-10-01,5,19,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ae421aee10c19ff310b83910d63b9fc223625

10.3892/mco.2020.2013,Corticosteroids alleviate adverse events associated with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the combined use of corticosteroid on adverse events (AEs) induced by enzalutamide (Enz) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The cohort of the present study included 121 consecutive patients with mCRPC who sequentially received androgen receptor-axis-targeted (ARAT) agents, abiraterone acetate (AA) and Enz, in any order, without prior docetaxel therapy. Detailed assessments of AEs during treatment with Enz were conducted according to whether or not corticosteroid was administered. Of these patients, 63 and 58 received ARAT therapy with the Enz-to-AA sequence (group 1) and the AA-to-Enz sequence (group 2), respectively. No patient in group 1 received corticosteroid during treatment with Enz, while corticosteroid was continuously administered in combination with Enz to all patients in group 2 following AA failure. When ARAT therapy was initiated, no significant differences in the major baseline characteristics were observed between the two groups. During Enz therapy, there were no significant differences in the incidence of any AEs or AEs ≥ grade 3 between the two groups. However, the incidences of fatigue and appetite loss in group 1 were significantly higher when compared with those in group 2. Furthermore, the combined use of corticosteroid was revealed to be independently associated with the prevention of fatigue and appetite loss during Enz therapy. The results of the present study suggested that the combined use of corticosteroids could reduce the incidence of certain types of AE, particularly fatigue and appetite loss, in mCRPC patients treated with Enz.",2020.0,2020-05-01,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001b47ad7b4d333646d8ed6adc20c11053c10e18

10.21037/TGH.2019.05.07,Extent of lymphadenectomy for Barrett's cancer.,"Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) has become the predominant histological cell type in western countries due to the prevalence of obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus. There is some evidence that this is increasing in the East as well. Surgery aims at achieving an R0 resection with clear margins, together with adequate and appropriate lymphadenectomy. Siewert type I and II cancers are more likely to be associated with Barrett's esophagus (especially in western countries), while type III cancers are mostly proximal gastric cancers that have grown upwards to involve the EGJ. For type I cancers, most surgeons would perform an esophagectomy, with at least an infra-carinal lymphadenectomy. It is more controversial for type II tumors, with some surgeons preferring an esophagectomy, while others may opt for a proximal or total radical gastrectomy via an abdominal approach. All procedures can be performed using open or minimally invasive methods. In addition to oncologic reasons, the chosen surgical approach also depends on expertise available, safety issues, and postoperative quality-of-life considerations. More data are needed in this area.

Although reports in the literature are limited, HAL is known for its high malignancy and poor prognosis, thus drawing increasing attention. We present the case of a patient with a mass-like consolidation with central necrosis initially misdiagnosed as inflammation at another medical institution despite a percutaneous lung biopsy.

10.1111/cas.14225,Fluvastatin potentiates anticancer activity of vorinostat in renal cancer cells,"Drug repositioning is an emerging approach to developing novel cancer treatments. Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor approved for cancer treatment, but it could attenuate its anticancer activity by activating the mTOR pathway. The HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin reportedly activates the mTOR inhibitor AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK), and we thought that it would potentiate vorinostat's anticancer activity in renal cancer cells. The combination of vorinostat and fluvastatin induced robust apoptosis and inhibited renal cancer growth effectively both in vitro and in vivo. Vorinostat activated the mTOR pathway, as evidenced by the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, and fluvastatin inhibited this phosphorylation by activating AMPK. Fluvastatin also enhanced vorinostat‐induced histone acetylation. Furthermore, the combination induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that was accompanied by aggresome formation. We also found that there was a positive feedback cycle among AMPK activation, histone acetylation, and ER stress induction. This is the first study to report the beneficial combined effect of vorinostat and fluvastatin in cancer cells.",2019.0,2019-11-25,44,78,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c09957fe02737b823196063f60e7f795ac90c
10.3390/ijms25073911,"The Predictive Role of Serum Lipid Levels, p53 and ki-67, According to Molecular Subtypes in Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Study","Dyslipidemia is a component of metabolic syndrome, having an important role in the carcinogenesis of different tumor types, such as prostate, ovarian, or renal cancer. The number of studies on the predictive potential of the different components of the lipid profile with a predictive potential in breast cancer is quite low. The evaluation of the lipid profile was carried out for the 142 patients who benefited from neoadjuvant therapy (NAC) in order to identify a potential predictive biomarker. The serological sample collection was performed sequentially according to a standardized protocol, pre-NAC, post-NAC and 6 months post-NAC after a 6-h pre-collection fast. We also investigated in the general group the presence or absence of the p53 mutation (TP53) and of the mitotic index ki-67, respectively, in relation to the molecular subtypes. The menopausal status, tumor size, family history, grading, Ki-67, p53 and LN metastases have a predictive nature regarding overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05), while for disease free survival (DFS), only tumor size, tumor grading, Ki-67 > 14, and p53+ are of predictive nature. The genetic and molecular analysis carried out in our group indicates that 71.67% have a Ki-67 score higher than 14%, and 39% of the patients have the positive P53 mutation. The multivariate analysis in the case of patients included in the TNBC subtype showed that the increased tumor volume (p = 0.002) and increased level of HDL (p = 0.004) represent predictive factors for the tumor response rate to NAC. High HDL-C levels before NAC and increased LDL-C levels after NAC were associated with the better treatment response in ER-positive and HER2+ breast cancer patients. Increased HDL-C values and tumor volume represent predictive factors as to the response rate to NAC in the case of patients included in the TNBC subtype. Regarding the ER+ and HER2+ subtypes, increased levels of HDL-C pre-NAC and increased levels of LDL-C post-NAC were associated with a better therapeutic response rate. Tumor grading, Ki-67, p53, and LN metastases have a predictive nature for OS, while tumor size, tumor grading, and Ki-67 > 14, and p53+ are predictive for DFS.",2024.0,2024-03-31,1,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c0c93f75f98b37f8a01507b6b5348e9bf28a0

Combined treatment with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and Western medicine has yielded promising results, leading to improved prognosis and overall survival. This retrospective case series aimed to illustrate the improved survival and quality of life outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients administered CHM based on traditional Chinese medicine theory. Methods: To investigate the effectiveness of CHM in prolonging overall survival, 182 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer who received CHM treatment were observed from 2005 to 2015. Results: One hundred eighty-two pancreatic cancer patients were treated with CHM; 21 patients died. The mean and median survival of these patients were 29.6 and 15.2 months, respectively; the 1-year survival rate was 76% (range = 4 months to 9 years). These results are better than those reported in patients treated with Western medicine, suggesting the need for further study of CHM. Conclusion: A superior clinical outcome may be obtained with CHM treatment. The case series illustrates the potential benefits and safety issues of CHM in pancreatic cancer patients that could be relevant for developing strategies to increase individualization of pancreatic cancer treatment and improve survival.

10.1093/abm/kay083,Therapeutic Alliance Between Dietitians and Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: The Effect of Training in a Health Behavior Change Intervention,"Abstract Background The relationship between a clinician and their client—the “therapeutic alliance” is a robust predictor of outcome in healthcare settings; yet, few interventions to improve alliance have been tested. Motivational interviewing is a client-centered approach that embodies many principles and strategies consistent with a strong therapeutic alliance. Purpose To examine whether alliance is enhanced by training dietitians to deliver a motivational interviewing informed health behavior change intervention (“Eating as Treatment”; EAT) as part of routine consultations with patients with head and neck cancer. The predictive ability of motivational interviewing techniques was also assessed. Methods A secondary analysis of the EAT stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy (n = 307) were treated by radiotherapy dietitians (n = 29) during the control (Treatment as Usual) or intervention (EAT) phase. Alliance was rated during the first and final weeks of radiotherapy, and again 4 and 12 weeks post-radiotherapy. Dietetic sessions were audiotaped. Week one sessions were objectively rated for dietitians’ use of motivational interviewing techniques. Results Generalized linear-mixed effects regressions found no effect of EAT on dietitian-rated alliance (p = .237). After excluding outliers, patient-rated alliance was 0.29 points lower after EAT training (p = .016). Post hoc analyses revealed lower patient ratings on perceived support and dietitian confidence. Hierarchical multiple regressions found that no specific motivational interviewing techniques predicted patient-rated alliance. Dietitian acknowledgment of patient challenges was related to dietitian-rated alliance (β =.15, p =.035). Conclusions Patient and dietitian ratings of alliance were high after EAT training, but not significantly improved. Further research is needed to better understand the differential impact of intervention training and delivery on patient and clinician ratings of therapeutic alliance.

10.1111/cas.14868,GPR126 regulates colorectal cancer cell proliferation by mediating HDAC2 and GLI2 expression,"The G‐protein‐coupled receptor 126 (GPR126) may play an important role in tumor development, although its role remains poorly understood. We found that GPR126 had higher expression in most colorectal cancer cell lines than in normal colon epithelial cell lines, and higher expression levels in colorectal cancer tissues than in normal adjacent colon tissues. GPR126 knockdown induced by shRNA inhibited cell viability and colony formation in HT‐29, HCT116, and LoVo cells, decreased BrdU incorporation into newly synthesized proliferating HT‐29 cells, led to an arrest of cell cycle progression at the G1 phase in HCT‐116 and HT‐29 cells, and suppressed tumorigenesis of HT‐29, HCT116, and LoVo cells in nude mouse xenograft models. GPR126 knockdown engendered decreased transcription and translation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), previously implicated in the activation of GLI1 and GLI2 in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of HDAC2 in GPR126‐silenced cells restored cell viability and proliferation, GLI2 luciferase reporter activity, partially recovered GLI2 expression, and reduced the cell cycle arrest. HDAC2 regulated GLI2 expression and, along with GLI2, it bound to the PTCH1 promoter, as evidenced by a chip assay with HT‐29 cells. Purmorphamine, a hedgehog agonist, largely restored the cell viability and expression of GLI2 proteins in GPR126‐silenced HT‐29 cells, whereas GANT61, a hedgehog inhibitor, further enhanced the GPR126 knockdown‐induced inhibitory effects. Our findings demonstrate that GPR126 regulates colorectal cancer cell proliferation by mediating the expression of HDAC2 and GLI2, therefore it may represent a suitable therapeutic target for colorectal cancer treatment.",2021.0,2021-02-24,16,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d5b8bcec952e4208f14aba817d30ccb44df3c

10.18632/oncotarget.13343,A novel highly potent trivalent TGF-β receptor trap inhibits early-stage tumorigenesis and tumor cell invasion in murine Pten-deficient prostate glands,"The effects of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling on prostate tumorigenesis has been shown to be strongly dependent on the stage of development, with TGF-β functioning as a tumor suppressor in early stages of disease and as a promoter in later stages. To study in further detail the paradoxical tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting roles of the TGF-β pathway, we investigated the effect of systemic treatment with a TGF-β inhibitor on early stages of prostate tumorigenesis. To ensure effective inhibition, we developed and employed a novel trivalent TGF-β receptor trap, RER, comprised of domains derived from the TGF-β type II and type III receptors. This trap was shown to completely block TβRII binding, to antagonize TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 signaling in cultured epithelial cells at low picomolar concentrations, and it showed equal or better anti-TGF-β activities than a pan TGF-β neutralizing antibody and a TGF-β receptor I kinase inhibitor in various prostate cancer cell lines. Systemic administration of RER inhibited prostate tumor cell proliferation as indicated by reduced Ki67 positive cells and invasion potential of tumor cells in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions in the prostate glands of Pten conditional null mice. These results provide evidence that TGF-β acts as a promoter rather than a suppressor in the relatively early stages of this spontaneous prostate tumorigenesis model. Thus, inhibition of TGF-β signaling in early stages of prostate cancer may be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit the progression as well as the metastatic potential in patients with prostate cancer.",2016.0,2016-11-14,28,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d9211efc32b7ee990ceeab86c3c6299116fa3
10.1042/BSR20181245,I-BET151 suppresses osteoclast formation and inflammatory cytokines secretion by targetting BRD4 in multiple myeloma,"Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematologic cancer, accompanied by excessive osteoclast formation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. The mechanisms by which bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein inhibitor I-BET151 regulates osteoclast differentiation and inflammatory cytokine secretion in MM are largely unknown. Methods: The isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal or patients with MM were treated with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and M-CSF to induce osteoclast differentiation. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with RANKL. I-BET151 was applied to investigate the effects of BRD4 inhibition on osteoclast formation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Osteoclast formation was determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) staining. The expression of osteoclast-specific genes TRACP, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), cathepsin K (Ctsk), and c-Src was tested using quantitative real-time PCR. And the level of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 was assessed by ELISA. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), BRD4, nuclear and cytoplasm p65, IκB-α, nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic (NFATc1), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression were measured by Western blotting. RNAi technology was applied to knock down BET family member BRD4. Results: I-BET151 dose-dependently suppressed osteoclast formation, inhibited the levels of osteoclast-specific genes TRACP, MMP-9, Ctsk, and c-Src and inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and RAW 264.7. I-BET151 inhibited the protein levels of BRD4 and NFATc1, increased OPG expression, and suppressed IκB-α degradation and p65 nuclear translocation. Further, the effects of I-BET151 on osteoclast formation, osteoclast-specific genes expression, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and NF-κB inhibition were promoted by BRD4 knockdown. Conclusion: I-BET151 inhibits osteoclast formation and inflammatory cytokine secretion by targetting BRD4-mediated RANKL-NF-κB signal pathway and BRD4 inhibition might be beneficial for MM treatment.",2018.0,2018-11-19,14,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001db2a56569accd0fff0db265d2a205344c257b

10.3390/molecules27072082,Inhibition of Metastatic Hepatocarcinoma by Combined Chemotherapy with Silencing VEGF/VEGFR2 Genes through a GalNAc-Modified Integrated Therapeutic System,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor related to high mortality and is still lacking a satisfactory cure. Tumor metastasis is currently a major challenge of cancer treatment, which is highly related to angiogenesis. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR signaling pathway is thus becoming an attractive therapeutic target. Moreover, chemotherapy combined with gene therapy shows great synergistic potential in cancer treatment with the promise of nanomaterials. In this work, a formulation containing 5-FU and siRNA against the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway into N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc)-modified nanocarriers is established. The targeting ability, biocompatibility and pH-responsive degradation capacity ensure the efficient transport of therapeutics by the formulation of 5-FU/siRNA@GalNAc-pDMA to HCC cells. The nano-construct integrated with gene/chemotherapy exhibits significant anti-metastatic HCC activity against C5WN1 liver cancer cells with tumorigenicity and pulmonary metastasis in the C5WN1-induced tumor-bearing mouse model with a tumor inhibition rate of 96%, which is promising for future metastatic HCC treatment.",2022.0,2022-03-24,6,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001de768a31014f8dec7ecc82baf14a8e721173e

We also explored the mechanism of cell apoptosis induction in HT29. HT29 cells were treated with different concentrations of MA and CPT-11 alone and in combination. The growth inhibition in HT29 cells was evaluated using MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected using AV-PI double staining flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect structural changes in cells. Topoisomerase (TOPO) I, Bax and Caspase-3 expression levels were evaluated using western blot analysis. MA and CPT-11 alone and in combination, inhibited the proliferation of HT29 cells, whereas the combination treatment exhibited higher inhibitory effect (P<0.01). This suggests the existence of synergistic cytotoxicity. Compared with each treatment alone, the combination treatment caused more significant damage to cell structure, and caused a significantly higher apoptosis rate (P<0.01). Additionally, the combination treatment increased TOPO I, Bax and Caspase-3 expression levels (P<0.01). In conclusion, MA in combination with CPT-11 synergistically inhibited HT29 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in these cells.

10.3389/fimmu.2015.00544,The Role of Latently Infected B Cells in CNS Autoimmunity,"The onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Among the environmental factors, it is believed that previous infection with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) may contribute in the development of MS. EBV has been associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematous, and cancers like Burkitt’s lymphoma. EBV establishes a life-long latency in B cells with occasional reactivation of the virus throughout the individual’s life. The role played by B cells in MS pathology has been largely studied, yet is not clearly understood. In MS patients, Rituximab, a novel treatment that targets CD20+ B cells, has proven to have successful results in diminishing the number of relapses in remitting relapsing MS; however, the mechanism of how this drug acts has not been clearly established. In this review, we analyze the evidence of how B cells latently infected with EBV might be altering the immune system response and helping in the development of MS. We will also discuss how animal models, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (γHV-68), can be used as powerful tools in the study of the relationship between EBV, MS, and B cells.",2015.0,2015-10-28,26,96,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e474539a127e7f3abc9bfbc54b7fd66b20091
10.3389/fphar.2021.702675,"Pharmacological Properties, Therapeutic Potential and Molecular Mechanisms of JWH133, a CB2 Receptor-Selective Agonist","The endocannabinoid system has attracted attention as a pharmacological target for several pathological conditions. Cannabinoid (CB2)-selective agonists have been the focus of pharmacological studies because modulation of the CB2 receptor (CB2R) can be useful in the treatment of pain, inflammation, arthritis, addiction, and cancer among other possible therapeutic applications while circumventing CNS-related adverse effects. Increasing number of evidences from different independent preclinical studies have suggested new perspectives on the involvement of CB2R signaling in inflammation, infection and immunity, thus play important role in cancer, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and metabolic diseases. JWH133 is a synthetic agonist with high CB2R selectivity and showed to exert CB2R mediated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, nephroprotective, and immunomodulatory activities. Cumulative evidences suggest that JWH133 protects against hepatic injury, renal injury, cardiotoxicity, fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer as well as against oxidative damage and inflammation, inhibits fibrosis and apoptosis, and acts as an immunosuppressant. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the polypharmacological properties and therapeutic potential of JWH133. This review also presents molecular mechanism and signaling pathways of JWH133 under various pathological conditions except neurological diseases. Based on the available data, this review proposes the possibilities of developing JWH133 as a promising therapeutic agent; however, further safety and toxicity studies in preclinical studies and clinical trials in humans are warranted.",2021.0,2021-07-30,24,291,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e5511af6f98b344b3defd8000a8cc93c8d239

10.1097/MD.0000000000014783,Malignant melanoma of the esophagus complicated with poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the stomach,"Rationale: Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus (PMME) is a rare malignancy that only accounts for <2% of all primary esophageal tumors. Here, we report the even rarer occurrence of PMME in combination with poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Patient concerns: A 64-year-old man was presented to the hospital with >1 month of eating dysphagia. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan only found a space-occupying lesion in the lower esophagus with moderate enhancement. However, gastroscope showed not only esophageal masses, but also gastric mucosa changes. Diagnoses: Poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma and PMME were diagnosed based on pathological biopsy and immunohistochemical methods. Interventions: The patient underwent laparoscopic gastric cancer radical surgery, esophageal resection, and colonic replacement of the esophagus. Outcomes: Abdominal CT and esophagography performed 1 week after surgery showed that it was consistent with postoperative changes without other abnormalities. However, the patient died 3 months after discharge without receiving any other treatment. Lessons: This case suggests more attention should be drawn to the diagnosis of multiple primary malignant neoplasms in elder patients, and also highlights the need to fulfill comprehensive examinations before surgery in case of misdiagnosis. Besides, it is challenging to finding a reasonable treatment for such rare condition.",2019.0,2019-03-01,3,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e5ee5709e20ceaed6dd315043f35569d55263

Additionally, development of photothermal agents for photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great interest in the field of nanomedicine. In the present study, copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles capped with bovine serum albumin (BSA), named CuS@BSA, was synthesized by a convenient method. Then, the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe MBA and the tumor-targeting ligand cyclic RGD were further conjugated on the surface of CuS@BSA, and the obtained nanocomposite was named CuS@BSA-MBA-cRGD. The morphology, optical properties, biotoxicity, tumor-targeting capability and in vitro and in vivo tumor inhibition effect were all characterized comprehensively.

10.1136/jitc-2024-008848,Sequence of androgen receptor-targeted vaccination with androgen deprivation therapy affects anti-prostate tumor efficacy,"Rationale Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the primary treatment for recurrent and metastatic prostate cancer. In addition to direct antitumor effects, ADT has immunomodulatory effects such as promoting T-cell infiltration and enhancing antigen processing/presentation. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that ADT also leads to increased expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and increased recognition of prostate tumor cells by AR-specific CD8+T cells. We have also demonstrated that ADT combined with a DNA vaccine encoding the AR significantly slowed tumor growth and improved the survival of prostate tumor-bearing mice. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of the timing and sequencing of ADT with vaccination on the tumor immune microenvironment in murine prostate cancer models to further increase the antitumor efficacy of vaccines. Methods Male FVB mice implanted with Myc-CaP tumor cells, or male C57BL/6 mice implanted with TRAMP-C1 prostate tumor cells, were treated with a DNA vaccine encoding AR (pTVG-AR) and ADT. The sequence of administration was evaluated for its effect on tumor growth, and tumor-infiltrating immune populations were characterized. Results Vaccination prior to ADT (pTVG-AR → ADT) significantly enhanced antitumor responses and survival. This was associated with increased tumor infiltration by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including AR-specific CD8+T cells. Depletion of CD8+T cells prior to ADT significantly worsened overall survival. Following ADT treatment, however, Gr1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) increased, and this was associated with fewer infiltrating T cells and reduced tumor growth. Inhibiting Gr1+MDSCs recruitment, either by using a CXCR2 antagonist or by cycling androgen deprivation with testosterone replacement, improved antitumor responses and overall survival. Conclusion Vaccination prior to ADT significantly improved antitumor responses, mediated in part by increased infiltration of CD8+T cells following ADT. Targeting MDSC recruitment following ADT further enhanced antitumor responses. These findings suggest logical directions for future clinical trials to improve the efficacy of prostate cancer vaccines.",2024.0,2024-05-01,2,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e97e24f53cc4aa9f938131941e45e32bec04a

10.3390/jcm14030985,Exploring Resting Sinus Tachycardia in Cancer Care: A Comprehensive Review,"Resting sinus tachycardia is frequently encountered in cancer patients. It affects a wide variety of cancer patients and is associated with distressing symptoms. Cancer-associated resting sinus tachycardia varies in its underlying mechanism. It can stem from the tumor burden or the side effects of chemotherapy/radiotherapy, or it can be secondary to paraneoplastic syndrome or the sequalae of cancer itself (infection, anemia, thrombosis, etc.). The clinical significance of resting sinus tachycardia extends beyond mere symptomatology, as it can potentially indicate severe complications which may facilitate or exacerbate a new or underlying cardiovascular dysfunction. Therefore, this necessitates thorough diagnostic tools to discern the underlying cause and tailor appropriate management strategies, whether pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or conservative. While resting sinus tachycardia has been extensively investigated in the context of cardiovascular disease, its underlying etiology, clinical implication, prognostic value, and treatment options remain vague in the context of cancer. This review aims to explore the topic of resting sinus tachycardia in cancer patients through delving deeper into its underlying mechanism, presenting the current evidence on its effect on cancer-independent cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, as well as providing some insight into the currently available treatment options. It will also propose therapeutic interventions and strategies aimed at optimizing cancer patient care. Lastly, it will highlight research gaps which need to be addressed further, as future research is needed to refine the diagnostic criteria, develop targeted therapies, find alternative cardioprotective/cardio-neutral chemotherapy options, and establish evidence-based guidelines to improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.",2025.0,2025-02-01,0,71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001edbdf33a42eda9b7b7067d188d601df3957eb

10.3390/pharmaceutics15020372,Comparative Analysis of Dasatinib Effect between 2D and 3D Tumor Cell Cultures,"Three-dimensional cell culture methods are able to confer new predictive relevance to in vitro tumor models. In particular, the 3D multicellular tumor spheroids model is considered to better resemble tumor complexity associated with drug resistance compared to the 2D monolayer model. Recent advances in 3D printing techniques and suitable biomaterials have offered new promises in developing 3D tissue cultures at increased reproducibility and with high-throughput characteristics. In our study, we compared the sensitivity to dasatinib treatment in two different cancer cell lines, prostate cancer cells DU145 and glioblastoma cells U87, cultured in the 3D spheroids model and in the 3D bioprinting model. DU145 and U87 cells were able to proliferate in 3D alginate/gelatin bioprinted structures for two weeks, forming spheroid aggregates. The treatment with dasatinib demonstrated that bioprinted cells were considerably more resistant to drug toxicity than corresponding cells cultured in monolayer, in a way that was comparable to behavior observed in the 3D spheroids model. Recovery and analysis of cells from 3D bioprinted structures led us to hypothesize that dasatinib resistance was dependent on a scarce penetrance of the drug, a phenomenon commonly reported also in spheroids. In conclusion, the 3D bioprinted model utilizing alginate/gelatin hydrogel was demonstrated to be a suitable model in drug screening when spheroid growth is required, offering advantages in feasibility, reproducibility, and scalability compared to the classical 3D spheroids model.",2023.0,2023-01-21,10,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001f1320fb0c8ded4f686aa472fdcfbfbe394163

10.1210/jendso/bvad114.2034,SAT563 Follicular Thyroid Cancer Masquerading as Chest Wall Mass With an Aggressive Course,"Abstract Disclosure: I. Goyal: None. E. Punni: None. L. Adhikari: None. Introduction:Follicular thyroid cancers (FTC) are more aggressive than papillary thyroid cancer and usually have more advanced tumor stage at the time of presentation. Musculoskeletal metastases are rare though, but when present can cause various complications like pathological fractures and nerve compression. Clinical case:A 75-year-old female was seen in orthopedics clinic for a left infraclavicular chest wall mass. MRI chest showed a large destructive mass invading the manubrium. Biopsy showed follicular cells consistent with ectopic thyroid tissue. CT neck/chest showed 2x1.8 cm right thyroid lobe nodule and left sternoclavicular joint metastasis. She underwent total thyroidectomy and resection of portions of manubrium, left clavicle and left 1st and 2nd rib. Pathology showed FTC in right thyroid lobe, measuring 2.6 cm in greatest dimension with angioinvasion, and FTC of manubrium, adjacent connective tissue and sternoclavicular joint and ribs, measuring 6.3 cm in greatest dimension. Pathological TNM staging was pT2N0M1. Her 6-week post-op thyroglobulin (Tg) level was 28.7 ng/mL (Beckman Coulter Immunometric Assay, reference value <0.1 athyrotic). She was started on levothyroxine supplementation to achieve a TSH <0.01 uIu/mL. She was subsequently treated with 200 mCi of radio-active iodine (RAI) as adjuvant therapy. Post-therapy whole body scan showed increased activity in the right strap muscle and iodine-avid osseous metastasis in right hemisacrum. She further received radiation therapy to neck and sternal regions, and the right sacroiliac joint. Following this, patient was monitored with serial Tg panel and neck ultrasound (US). Her initial post-op US neck showed a soft tissue fullness in right thyroidectomy bed, concerning for residual disease but this was no longer seen after 3 months. Her Tg level downtrended from 28.7 ng/mL to 12.6 ng/mL and further to 1.8 ng/mL at 1-year follow-up. However, her course was complicated by development of several oral ulcers resulting from high-dose RAI therapy which were treated symptomatically with hydration, topical analgesics and Listerine mouth washes. The patient reported ongoing bowel incontinence since her initial cancer diagnosis. MRI pelvis showed rim-enhancing 4.5cm lesion centered at right sacral ala and extending into adjacent S1/S2 neural foramina. She was re-referred for palliative radiation therapy.Conclusion:This case of FTC is unique due to its uncommon initial presentation. Skeletal metastases to sacrum resulted in bowel incontinence in our patient. When present, skeletal metastases need treatment with high-dose (200 mCi) RAI. RAI therapy can cause xerostomia, hypogeusia and sialadenitis due to reductions in salivary flow. Clinicians should be aware of the early and late-onset complications of RAI therapy, discuss these with the patient before therapy and manage the complications adequately if these occur.

10.1593/TLO.13205,Evaluation of potentially predictive markers for anti-angiogenic therapy with sunitinib in recurrent ovarian cancer patients.,"INTRODUCTION
In ovarian cancer, new therapeutic strategies are needed because the vast majority of patients develop a recurrence and resistance to platinum derivates. Attached to the AGO-OVAR2.11 study investigating the multityrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib in recurrent platinum refractory ovarian cancers, this translational research project assesses the potential value of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble VEGF receptor-3 (sVEGFR-3), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) levels for progression-free survival (PFS).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Longitudinal serum samples were taken while the patient was on study drugs. Serum concentration of VEGF, sVEGFR-3, and Ang-2 was determined by ELISA. The slope of the markers was correlated to the PFS.


RESULTS
Patients showing a decrease in VEGF concentration had a median PFS of 10.5 months [confidence interval (CI), 2.89-12.25] compared to 2.9 months (CI, 1.48-5.32) in the case of an increase (P = .17). The stratified log-rank test showed a trend for longer PFS if a decrease of Ang-2 was observed (P = .089). Dichotomized in absolute decrease or increase, the PFS was 8.4 months (CI, 2.89-12.26) versus 2.7 months (CI, 1.05-5.32), respectively. Patients with a reduction of the sVEGFR-3 concentration had a median PFS of 4.76 months (CI 2.86-10.65) versus 8.61 months (CI, 1.05-not estimable) in patients with an increase of sVEGFR-3.

10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1758,Whole-Exome Sequencing Reveals Defective CYP3A4 Variants Predictive of Paclitaxel Dose-Limiting Neuropathy,"Purpose: Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, can cause peripheral neuropathies leading to dose reductions and treatment suspensions and decreasing the quality of life of patients. It has been suggested that genetic variants altering paclitaxel pharmacokinetics increase neuropathy risk, but the major causes of interindividual differences in susceptibility to paclitaxel toxicity remain unexplained. We carried out a whole-exome sequencing (WES) study to identify genetic susceptibility variants associated with paclitaxel neuropathy. Experimental Design: Blood samples from 8 patients with severe paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy were selected for WES. An independent cohort of 228 cancer patients with complete paclitaxel neuropathy data was used for variant screening by DHPLC and association analysis. HEK293 cells were used for heterologous expression and characterization of two novel CYP3A4 enzymes. Results: WES revealed 2 patients with rare CYP3A4 variants, a premature stop codon (CYP3A4*20 allele) and a novel missense variant (CYP3A4*25, p.P389S) causing reduced enzyme expression. Screening for CYP3A4 variants in the independent cohort revealed three additional CYP3A4*20 carriers, and two patients with missense variants exhibiting diminished enzyme activity (CYP3A4*8 and the novel CYP3A4*27 allele, p.L475V). Relative to CYP3A4 wild-type patients, those carrying CYP3A4 defective variants had more severe neuropathy (2- and 1.3-fold higher risk of neuropathy for loss-of-function and missense variants, respectively, P = 0.045) and higher probability of neuropathy-induced paclitaxel treatment modifications (7- and 3-fold higher risk for loss-of-function and missense variants, respectively, P = 5.9 × 10−5). Conclusion: This is the first description of a genetic marker associated with paclitaxel treatment modifications caused by neuropathy. CYP3A4 defective variants may provide a basis for paclitaxel treatment individualization.

10.3389/fonc.2024.1386294,State of the art of cervical cancer treatment in rare histologies,"The objective of this review is to summarize the current scientific evidence to formulate clinical recommendations regarding the classification, diagnostic approach, and treatment of rare histological subtypes of cervical cancer; neuroendocrine carcinoma, gastric-type mucinous adenocarcinoma, and glassy cell adenocarcinoma. These histological subtypes are generally characterized by their low frequency, aggressive biological behavior, certain chemoradioresistance, and consequently, high recurrence rates with a deleterious impact on survival. Molecular studies have identified several associated mutations in neuroendocrine carcinoma (PIK3CA, MYC, TP53, PTEN, ARID1A, KRAS, BRCA2) and gastric-type adenocarcinoma (KRAS, ARID1A, PTEN) that may serve as molecular targets. While adenocarcinomas are typically treated and classified based on squamous histology across early, locally advanced, and advanced stages, the treatment strategies for neuroendocrine carcinomas in early stages or locally advanced cases differ, particularly in the sequencing of administering chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, or surgery. The chemotherapy regimen is based on etoposide plus cisplatin (EP). Unlike squamous cell carcinomas, immune checkpoint inhibitors are yet to establish a standard role in the treatment of recurrent neuroendocrine carcinomas due to the absence of clinical trials. Regarding glassy cell adenocarcinomas and gastric-type adenocarcinoma, the potential use of immunotherapy in advanced stages/disease requires further evaluation through international collaborations, given the limited number of cases.",2024.0,2024-06-28,1,58,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0022250e080fcd43a4aa8c2dc00f1011c00749af

10.7150/thno.33353,Disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis with artemisinin unravels anti-angiogenesis effects via auto-paracrine mechanisms,"Rationale: Tumor angiogenesis promotes tumor development, progression, growth, and metastasis. Metronomic chemotherapy involves the frequent administration of low-dose chemotherapeutic agents to block angiogenic activity and reduce side effects. Methods: MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with various concentrations of artemisinin (ART) and vinorelbine (NVB) and the cytotoxic effects of ART/NVB were determined using the CCK-8 assay. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm) and mass were assessed using MitoSOX, TMRE and MitoTracker green staining. Western blot analysis was used to quantify the expression of autophagy-related proteins. Herein, by using bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification, we identified CREB as a master in MDA-MB-231 cells. Results: We found that artemisinin (ART), which exhibits anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer effects via mitochondrial regulation, synergized with vinorelbine (NVB) to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. ART and NVB cooperated to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. CREB acted as a crucial regulator of PGC1α and VEGF, which played critical roles in NVB-dependent growth factor depletion. Moreover, CREB suppression significantly reversed mitochondrial dysfunction following ART/NVB co-treatment. In addition, combination treatment with ART and NVB significantly suppressed tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model, with downregulated CREB and PGC1α expression levels observed in tumor biopsies, in agreement with our in vitro and ex vivo data. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that ART affects cancer and endothelial cells by targeting the auto-paracrine effects of VEGF to suppress mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis, and migration between cancer cells and endothelial cells.",2019.0,2019-09-17,35,62,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00228660d3d1bbb4ff13bd192b6d109b76db267b

In this review, we explore the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in advancing therapies for these conditions, as well as its potential in targeting senescent cells. Since the risk of Alzheimer’s disease is strongly associated with genetic mutations and variations, the use of gene editing technologies to rectify these genetic errors by modifying disease-associated proteins becomes relevant. For cancer, to enhance immunotherapy approaches, modification of immune cells have been utilized to improve their anti-tumor efficacy. Additionally, the review also investigates the role of CRISPR-Cas9 in targeting senescent cells, which are implicated in both aging-related disorders and cancer progression. While challenges remain in introducing delivery methods and specificity, CRISPR-Cas9 represents a significant advancement in developing targeted, personalized treatments for these challenging health issues.",2024.0,2024-07-28,16,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0022d5a1dcbe7db7f0bd9b012fe358d45973badd

10.3390/cancers11081194,The Multiple Roles and Therapeutic Potential of Molecular Chaperones in Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer types in men worldwide. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones that are widely implicated in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of many cancers. The role of HSPs in PCa is complex and their expression has been linked to the progression and aggressiveness of the tumor. Prominent chaperones, including HSP90 and HSP70, are involved in the folding and trafficking of critical cancer-related proteins. Other members of HSPs, including HSP27 and HSP60, have been considered as promising biomarkers, similar to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), for PCa screening in order to evaluate and monitor the progression or recurrence of the disease. Moreover, expression level of chaperones like clusterin has been shown to correlate directly with the prostate tumor grade. Hence, targeting HSPs in PCa has been suggested as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. In the current review, we discuss the functions as well as the role of HSPs in PCa progression and further evaluate the approach of inhibiting HSPs as a cancer treatment strategy.",2019.0,2019-08-01,54,273,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00230a9bed14d8f1a822678b6f0c388b2875ad34

10.6004/JADPRO.2016.7.3.4,2015 Review of Newly Approved Oncologic Therapies,"PATHWAY INHIBITORS Two molecular pathway inhibitors were approved: sonidegib (Odomzo) and olaparib (Lynparza). Sonidegib, the second oral hedgehog inhibitor, is indicated for adults with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma that has recurred after surgery or radiation therapy or for those ineligible for surgery or radiation. Supporting data came from the randomized phase II BOLT trial (Migden et al., 2015). Advanced practitioners should be on the alert for the adverse events reported with this oral agent, including muscle spasms, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased weight, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and pruritus. “The majority of patients you put on this drug will get muscle pain,” Dr. Medina indicated. “If your patient develops any new muscle pain, you want to get a creatinine kinase level, and follow the specific recommendations for holding the drug based on elevated levels,” he said. “That is a fairly unique side effect for this class of agents, and there are some differences here between this drug and vismodegib, which does not cause as big of an increase in creatinine kinase.” The PARP inhibitor olaparib is indicated as a single-agent treatment for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Approval was based on a clinical trial in which responses to olaparib were observed across different tumor types with these mutations (Kaufman et al., 2015). The main side effects of olaparib are anemia, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, arthralgia, and rash. “Although anemia is the biggest side effect, arthralgia can be troublesome for patients,” Dr. Giordana noted.

10.3390/jcm13216518,Evolving Role of Lymphedema Surgery on Breast Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Multi-Institutional Algorithmic Approach,"Background/Objectives: Recent advancements in breast cancer treatment have led to increased survival rates, prompting a shift towards addressing breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Despite the evolving role of lymphatic surgery in breast reconstruction, there is limited literature evaluating the current role of lymphatic surgery in breast reconstruction. This review aims to evaluate the state of lymphatic surgery in breast reconstruction, analyzing surgical techniques and proposing a multi-institutional algorithmic approach. Methods: Through a search and screening of literature, data regarding the study type, type of operation (bypass, pLVB/ILR/LYMPHA, VLNT, or a combination of treatments), and clinical outcomes were collected. Results: The systematic review included 184 studies. Overall, the number of publications on lymphatic surgery increased from 4.4 per year (2010–2016) to 21.1 per year since 2017. The most published procedure was vascularized lymph node transfer (34.6%), followed by preventive lymphatic surgery (31.4%), therapeutic lymphovenous bypass (23.3%), and combined breast and lymphatic reconstruction (10.7%). While VLNT was the most published procedure, preventive surgery has been the most published topic since 2020, with 11.7 articles per year since. Similarly, there has been an increase in studies on combined lymphatic surgery and breast reconstruction in the last five years, with 16 articles published. Conclusions: The role of lymphatic surgery in breast cancer patients is evolving, with an increasing emphasis on preventive procedures and combined reconstructive approaches. However, our study shows that the current literature is predominantly based on lower-level evidence, highlighting the need for more randomized controlled trials to establish stronger clinical recommendations.",2024.0,2024-10-30,2,75,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0023c7ce70d73d113a43c4a4f93c1e6002d392aa

10.1371/journal.pone.0173706,Inhibition of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a ameliorates methylglyoxal-induced peritoneal fibrosis,"Activity of H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a is reportedly induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and plays an important role in the progression of cancer and fibrosis. In this study, we investigated whether inhibition of G9a-mediated H3K9 methylation attenuates peritoneal fibrosis in mice and human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). Nonadherent cells of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients were isolated from PD effluent to examine expression of G9a. Peritoneal fibrosis was induced by peritoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) in male C57/B6 mice for 3 weeks. BIX01294, a G9a inhibitor, was administered by subcutaneous injection. Effects of BIX01294 on MGO-induced pathological and functional changes in mice were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and a peritoneal equilibration test. HPMCs were isolated from human omentum, and the inhibitory effect of BIX01294 on TGF-β1-induced fibrotic changes was investigated in the HPMCs by western blotting. G9a was upregulated in nonadherent cells of human PD effluent, the peritoneum of MGO-injected mice, and TGF-β1-stimulated HPMCs. BIX01294 significantly reduced the submesothelial zone thickness and cell density in MGO-injected mice. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that BIX01294 treatment decreased not only mono-methylation of H3K9 (H3K9me1), but also the number of mesenchymal cells, accumulation of collagen, and infiltration of monocytes. In addition to the pathological changes, BIX01294 reduced the level of TGF-β1 in peritoneal fluid and improved peritoneal functions. Furthermore, BIX01294 inhibited TGF-β1-induced fibrotic changes along with suppression of H3K9me1 in HPMCs. Therefore, inhibition of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a suppresses peritoneal fibrosis through a reduction of H3K9me1.",2017.0,2017-03-09,24,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0024c58d776dfaf927086c0f7e81b00336bb5712

10.18632/ONCOTARGET.742,Autophagy-related gene 12 (ATG12) is a novel determinant of primary resistance to HER2-targeted therapies: Utility of transcriptome analysis of the autophagy interactome to guide breast cancer treatment,"The autophagic process, which can facilitate breast cancer resistance to endocrine, cytotoxic, and molecularly targeted agents, is mainly regulated at the post-translational level. Although recent studies have suggested a possible transcriptome regulation of the autophagic genes, little is known about either the analysis tools that can be applied or the functional importance of putative candidate genes emerging from autophagy-dedicated transcriptome studies. In this context, we evaluated whether the constitutive activation of the autophagy machinery, as revealed by a transcriptome analysis using an autophagy-focused polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, might allow for the identification of novel autophagy-specific biomarkers for intrinsic (primary) resistance to HER2-targeted therapies. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based profiling of 84 genes involved in autophagy revealed that, when compared to trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3 cells, the positive regulator of autophagic vesicle formation ATG12 (autophagy-related gene 12) was the most differentially up-regulated gene in JIMT1 cells, a model of intrinsic cross-resistance to trastuzumab and other HER1/2-targeting drugs. An analysis of the transcriptional status of ATG12 in > 50 breast cancer cell lines suggested that the ATG12 transcript is commonly upregulated in trastuzumab-unresponsive HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. A lentiviral-delivered small hairpin RNA stable knockdown of the ATG12 gene fully suppressed the refractoriness of JIMT1 cells to trastuzumab, erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib in vitro. ATG12 silencing significantly reduced JIMT1 tumor growth induced by subcutaneous injection in nude mice. Remarkably, the outgrowth of trastuzumab-unresponsive tumors was prevented completely when trastuzumab treatment was administered in an ATG12-silenced genetic background. We demonstrate for the first time the usefulness of low-density, autophagy-dedicated qRT-PCR-based platforms for monitoring primary resistance to HER2-targeted therapies by transcriptionally screening the autophagy interactome. The degree of predictive accuracy warrants further investigation in the clinical situation.",2012.0,2012-11-17,72,117,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00252685c2817f7a0e9760765b9bc0e7719b6f88
10.1093/oncolo/oyae027,Adherence to Treatment and Follow-Up of Precancerous Cervical Lesions in Ethiopia,"Abstract Background In Ethiopia, both incidence and mortality of cervical cancer are relatively high. Screening services, which were implemented during the past few years, are currently being expanded. The World Health Organization recommends patients with a positive VIA (visual inspection with acetic acid) result should immediately receive treatment followed by rescreening after 1 year as precancerous lesions can reoccur or become residential despite treatment. Materials and Methods Screening logbooks dating between 2017 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed in 14 health facilities of Addis Ababa and Oromia region. Data for 741 women with a VIA-positive result were extracted and those women were asked to participate in a questionnaire-based phone interview to gain insights about adherence to treatment and follow-up. Data were analyzed using descriptive methods and then fitted into 2 generalized linear models to test variables for an influence on adherence to follow up. Results Around 13 800 women had received a VIA screening, of which approximately 820 (5.9%) were VIA positive. While over 90% of women with a positive screen received treatment, only about half of the treated patients returned for a follow-up examination. After treatment, 31 women had a VIA-positive re-screen. We found that educational status, age over 40, no/incorrect follow-up appointment, health facility-related barriers, and use of reminders are important drivers of adherence to follow up. Conclusion Our results revealed that adherence to treatment after VIA positive screening is relatively high whereas adherence to follow up recommendations still needs improvement. Reminders like appointment cards and phone calls can effectively reduce the loss of follow-up.",2024.0,2024-02-23,2,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002533812440cc3967339e9856396a2a9f8e9b7f

Solid cancers with bone marrow metastases are rare but lethal. This study aimed to identify clinical factors predictive of survival in adult patients with solid cancers and bone marrow metastases.


METHODS
A total of 83 patients were enrolled consecutively between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012. Bone marrow metastases were confirmed by biopsies. Patient clinical features and laboratory data were analyzed for associations.


RESULTS
The median age of the patients was 54 years (range, 23-88 years), and 58% were male. The 3 most common primary tumor locations were the stomach (32 patients, 39%), prostate (16 patients, 19%), and lungs (12 patients, 15%). The median overall survival was 49 days (range, 3-1423 days). Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1, cancers of prostate origin, platelet counts over 50,000/ml, and undergoing antitumor therapies had a significantly better prognosis in the multivariate analysis. The median survival times were 173 and 33 days for patients with 2-3 more favorable parameters (n=24) and those with 0-1 (n=69), respectively (hazard ratio 0.30; 95% CI 0.17-0.52, p<0.001).

10.1097/MD.0000000000038752,Diagnostic performance of the Japanese Narrow-band imaging expert team classification system using dual focus magnification in real-time Vietnamese setting,"The JNET classification, combined with magnified narrowband imaging (NBI), is essential for predicting the histology of colorectal polyps and guiding personalized treatment strategies. Despite its recognized utility, the diagnostic efficacy of JNET classification using NBI with dual focus (DF) magnification requires exploration in the Vietnamese context. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of the JNET classification with the NBI-DF mode in predicting the histology of colorectal polyps in Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Medical Center in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. During real-time endoscopy, endoscopists evaluated the lesion characteristics and recorded optical diagnoses using the dual focus mode magnification according to the JNET classification. En bloc lesion resection (endoscopic or surgical) provided the final pathology, serving as the reference standard for optical diagnoses. A total of 739 patients with 1353 lesions were recruited between October 2021 and March 2023. The overall concordance with the JNET classification was 86.9%. Specificities and positive predictive values for JNET types were: type 1 (95.7%, 88.3%); type 2A (81.4%, 90%); type 2B (96.6%, 54.7%); and type 3 (99.9%, 93.3%). The sensitivity and negative predictive value for differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions were 97.8% and 88.3%, respectively. However, the sensitivity for distinguishing malignant from benign neoplasia was lower at 64.1%, despite a specificity of 95.9%. Notably, the specificity and positive predictive value for identifying deep submucosal cancer were high at 99.8% and 93.3%.

10.3390/cancers16203519,The Added Value of Controlling Nutritional Status (Conut) Score for Preoperative Counselling on Significant Early Loss of Renal Function After Radical Nephrectomy for Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Simple Summary Renal Cell Carcinoma is a common cancer in Western countries. To date, the gold standard treatment for localized non-metastatic disease is partial or radical nephrectomy. When surgical treatment is feasible, the prediction of postoperative renal function might influence the treatment algorithm. On the other hand, there is growing evidence indicating that immune response and nutritional status are crucial factors in human cancer development and progression. In this scenario, the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score was initially developed as a malnutrition screening tool. Its formula includes serum albumin levels, total lymphocyte count, and total serum cholesterol. Serum albumin is used as an indicator of protein reserves. Cholesterol is used as a caloric depletion parameter. Total lymphocyte count represents an indicator of immune defense impairment due to malnutrition. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the CONUT score on clinically significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with non-metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma undergoing radical nephrectomy. Our findings confirmed that a preoperative high CONUT score is an independent predictor of a significant renal function decline after surgery. Being easy to use, cost effective, and ideally a completely automated tool, its preoperative assessment could be part of a personalized risk-stratification tailored to the clinical conditions and comorbidities of each patient. Abstract Background and Objectives: We aimed at evaluating the impact of Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score on clinically significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with non-metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) undergoing radical nephrectomy (RN). Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed a multi-institutional cohort of 140 patients with ccRCC who underwent RN between 2016 and 2018 at three Urological Centers. The CONUT score was calculated with an algorithm including serum albumin, total lymphocyte count, and cholesterol. Clinical and pathologic features were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and a Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables. To define the independent predictors of clinically significant eGFR decline, univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) binomial logistic regression analyses were performed in order to assess the Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). Results: The optimal cut-off value to discriminate between a low and high CONUT score was assessed by calculating the ROC curve. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.67 (95%CI 0.59–0.78) with the most appropriate cut-off value at 2 points. Overall, 46 patients (32.9%) had a high CONUT score (>2). Statistically significant variables associated with eGFR decline at 24 months were age ≥ 70 (OR 2.01; 95%CI 1.17–3.09; p = 0.05), stage II–III chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR 6.05; 95%CI 1.79–28.3; p = 0.001), and a high CONUT score (OR 3.98; 95%CI 1.58–10.4; p = 0.004). Conclusions: The CONUT score is a low-time-consuming, cost-effective, and promising tool able to preoperatively screen patients at risk of developing CKD after a RN.",2024.0,2024-10-01,2,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00268ed93b28639b5b69d0e1d886faaa1b624a72

10.4103/1673-5374.202941,Neurorestoration from medicinal plants: an opportunity to treat painful neuropathies,"Neuropathic pain originates from damages to the somatosensory nervous system (IASP International Association for the Study of Pain taxonomy). Lesions (traumas, compression, iatrogenic and pharmacological causes) or diseases (infections, diabetes, ischemia, cancer) lead to the establishment of hypersensitivity. Afterwards, the maladaptive plasticity of the nervous structures facilitates pain chronicization (von Hehn et al., 2012; Di Cesare Mannelli et al., 2013). Currently, clinicians have very limited therapeutic resources available often associated to a burden of side effects (Hurley et al., 2013). Recently, we showed (Di Cesare Mannelli et al., 2016, summarized in Figure 1) the efficacy of a selected rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) extract, obtained by an innovative extraction process. In rats, it is able to control neuropathic pain (induced by the chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve; CCI) and prevents the alterations of the nervous system induced by nerve injury. Data offer a preclinical evaluation for a prospective industrial scale up and therapeutic application of a natural, safe, disease-modifying product for the treatment of neuropathies. The use of medicinal plants for treating complex, chronic pathologies related to severe alterations of the nervous system, like neuropathies, is an intriguing perspective. The scientific and clinical relevance of this approach is often compromised by evidences of activity obtained with not standardized procedures and referred to vegetal products scarcely characterized as extraction methods, chemical composition and pharmacodynamic profile. Starting by this awareness, selected extracts from rosemary leaves were obtained by the cooperation between the University of Florence and the University of Turin. The extracts were characterized and compared in terms of phenolic composition to define the more active constituents. The progressive increase of terpenoid contents paralleled with higher pain relieving efficacy till to suggest the fundamental role of carnosic acid. The strong anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effect of the pure compound let us to produce a new terpenoid-enriched rosemary extract (URE). A technological improvement was reached using the innovative ultrasounds assisted extraction procedure. The method is clean, the low bulk temperature and the rapid execution avoid degradative processes offering several advantages in terms of higher yields and higher selectivity, improving the processing time, reducing chemical and physical hazards. The final extraction product URE was able to reduce the development of CCI-dependent painful response to suprathreshold stimulation and to increase pain threshold to non-noxious stimuli. URE reduced the postural unbalance related to spontaneous, non-evoked pain, a feature of neuropathy progression mainly related to the somatosensory component. The pain-relieving effect of URE progressively increased during treatment suggesting a rescue mechanism that protects the nervous tissue",2017.0,2017-03-01,0,13,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0026ea4793c4333cbe12aa364eda02f5522fc985

10.1371/journal.pone.0149789,Shared Decision-Making in Oncology – A Qualitative Analysis of Healthcare Providers’ Views on Current Practice,"Background Despite an increased awareness of shared decision-making (SDM) and its prominent position on the health policy agenda, its implementation in routine care remains a challenge in Germany. In order to overcome this challenge, it is important to understand healthcare providers’ views regarding SDM and to take their perspectives and opinions into account in the development of an implementation program. The present study aimed at exploring a) the attitudes of different healthcare providers regarding SDM in oncology and b) their experiences with treatment decisions in daily practice. Material and Methods A qualitative study was conducted using focus groups and individual interviews with different healthcare providers at the University Cancer Center Hamburg, Germany. Focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using conventional content analysis and descriptive statistics. Results N = 4 focus groups with a total of N = 25 participants and N = 17 individual interviews were conducted. Attitudes regarding SDM varied greatly between the different participants, especially concerning the definition of SDM, the attitude towards the degree of patient involvement in decision-making and assumptions about when SDM should take place. Experiences on how treatment decisions are currently made varied. Negative experiences included time and structural constraints, and a lack of (multidisciplinary) communication. Positive experiences comprised informed patients, involvement of relatives and a good physician-patient relationship. Conclusion The results show that German healthcare providers in oncology have a range of attitudes that currently function as barriers towards the implementation of SDM. Also, their experiences on how decision-making is currently done reveal difficulties in actively involving patients in decision-making processes. It will be crucial to take these attitudes and experiences seriously and to subsequently disentangle existing misconceptions in future implementation programs.",2016.0,2016-03-11,37,59,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0027c7ee94e08de01e98b14640bf3252e980a1af

10.2147/OTT.S87159,Different setup errors assessed by weekly cone-beam computed tomography on different registration in nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy,"The study aimed to investigate the difference of setup errors on different registration in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on weekly cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Thirty nasopharyngeal cancer patients scheduled to undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) were prospectively enrolled in the study. Each patient had a weekly CBCT before radiation therapy. In the entire study, 201 CBCT scans were obtained. The scans were registered to the planning CT to determine the difference of setup errors on different registration sites. Different registration sites were represented by bony landmarks. Nasal septum and pterygoid process represent head, cervical vertebrae 1–3 represent upper neck, and cervical vertebrae 4–6 represent lower neck. Patient positioning errors were recorded in the right–left (RL), superior–inferior (SI), and anterior–posterior (AP) directions over the course of radiotherapy. Planning target volume margins were calculated from the systematic and random errors. In this study, we can make a conclusion that there are setup errors in RL, SI, and AP directions of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients undergoing IMRT. In addition, the head and neck setup error has the difference, with statistical significance, while patient setup error of neck is greater than that of head during the course of radiotherapy. In our institution, we recommend a planning target volume margin of 3.0 mm in RL direction, 1.3 mm in SI direction, and 2.6 mm in AP direction for nasopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing IMRT with weekly CBCT scans.",2015.0,2015-09-14,17,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0027e4308e02ae1dafb2d9a3bc8e3950fda1eb50

Among these, clam polysaccharides, a type of marine-derived polysaccharide, exhibit notable biological activities, including both anticancer effects and immune modulation. The aims of this study are to investigate the anticancer and immunomodulatory effects of microwave-extracted clam polysaccharide (MCP) in vitro. Cell experiments demonstrated that MCP significantly inhibited both colony formation and migration of HT-29 cells. Furthermore, treatment with MCP led to the downregulation of Bcl-2 gene expression, a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of cytochrome C gene and caspase-3 gene, and, finally, the induction of apoptosis in HT-29 cells, implying the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway. Additionally, MCP was found to prompt a phenotypic shift in macrophages from M2 to M1 subtype and from M0 to M1 subtype. MCP also decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels within the cancer cells, thereby augmenting anticancer efficacy through a dual mechanism of immune activation and antioxidant enhancement. These findings suggest that MCPs present significant potential as natural antitumor agents and immunomodulators, especially in the development of functional foods or drugs.",2024.0,2024-11-01,1,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00281de9ffffb1d73c9fd0ffa00b5fd8325d5f41

This proof-of-principle study aimed to test the feasibility of modulating the in vivo behaviors of DC vaccines (DCVs) by introducing siRNA-laden magnetic resonance (MR) imaging nanovectors into cells, while providing visible information on their homing to lymph nodes. The N-alkyl-PEI2k-LAC/SPIO nanocomposites were prepared and characterized, showing favorable properties of siRNA transfection and MRI labeling efficiency in DCs. Cell viability assays revealed no observable effects on the survival and phenotype of DCs if the concentration of the complex was within 8 μg Fe/ml. An orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer was developed. The DCVs transfected with IDO siRNA contained nanocomposites were adoptively transferred to start the treatment. MR imaging clearly visualized the homing of DCVs into lymph nodes. At the end of the treatment, DCVs presented significantly better tumor suppression than DCs or PBS (P < 0.05). Generally, the N-alkyl-PEI2k-LAC/SPIO nanocomposites represent a highly efficient MR imaging platform for siRNA transfection that is potentially useful for in vivo tracking of vaccine cells.",2021.0,2021-02-05,3,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002838a1d45231df262ca9f30bac106c7deb30ab

In head and neck cancer patients undergoing curative radiotherapy, we investigated the benefits and harms of an early exercise regime on trismus. Material and methods. Patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy were centrally randomised to exercises 5–6 times for 45 minutes during and after radiotherapy supervised by a physiotherapist in addition to usual care versus usual care alone. The primary outcome was change in maximal interincisor distance (MID) measured at 5 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were change in cervical ranges of motion, tissue tightness, and health-related quality of life. Mixed model analysis of repeated measures adjusted for tumour size and operation was conducted to assess the effect of early preventive exercises across time periods. Results. Of the 100 patients included, two patients withdrew and one died before the onset of radiotherapy. The unadjusted mean difference in MID at 12 months after having completed radiotherapy was 0.83 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) –3.64–5.29, p = 0.71) in the exercise intervention group compared with the control group. When adjusted for operation and tumour size, the effect of the exercise intervention on mean MID from baseline to 12-month follow-up was 5.92 mm (95% CI –0.48–12.33, p = 0.07). Of the secondary outcomes, cervical rotation showed a statistically significant deterioration in the exercise group compared with the control group (p = 0.01). No significant effects were observed on the other secondary outcomes. Conclusions. In patients with cancer in the oral cavity or oropharynx, early supervised exercises combined with self-care treatment focusing on mobility exercises to reduce trismus do not seem to provide additional beneficial effects compared with usual care during curative radiotherapy.",2015.0,2015-01-02,31,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002886c37d2941e68a324398950261af085ce2f7
10.1530/EC-19-0340,AR mRNA stability is increased with AR-antagonist resistance via 3′UTR variants,"Advanced prostate cancer is often treated with AR antagonists which target the androgen receptor (AR) on which the growth of the tumour depends. Prostate cancer often develops AR-antagonist resistance via a plethora of mechanisms, many of which are as yet unknown, but it is thought that AR upregulation or AR ligand-binding site mutations, may be responsible. Here we describe the production of cell lines based on LNCaP and VCaP, with acquired resistance to the clinically relevant AR antagonists, bicalutamide and enzalutamide. In these resistant cells, we observed, via RNA-seq, that new variants in the 3′UTR of the AR mRNA were detectable and that the levels were increased both with AR-antagonist treatment and with hormonal starvation. Around 20% of AR transcripts showed a 3 kb deletion within the 6.7 kb 3′UTR sequence. Actinomycin D and luciferase fusion studies indicated that this shorter mRNA variant was inherently more stable in anti-androgen-resistant cell lines. Of additional interest was that the AR UTR variant could be detected in the sera of prostate cancer patients in a cohort of serum samples collected from patients of Gleason grades 6–10, with an increasing level correlated to increasing grade. We hypothesise that the shorter AR UTR variant is a survival adaptation to low hormone levels and/or AR-antagonist treatment in these cells, where a more stable mRNA may allow higher levels of AR expression under these conditions.",2019.0,2019-11-01,4,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028874ad343a2dfda0ca0d0dd3eed72b1a4d594

10.3390/ijms21093157,Repurposing Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors to Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancer: A Focus on Transporters and Lysosomal Sequestration,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are being increasingly used to treat various malignancies. Although they were designed to target aberrant tyrosine kinases, they are also intimately linked with the mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. MDR-related solute carrier (SLC) and ATB-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are responsible for TKI uptake and efflux, respectively. However, the role of TKIs appears to be dual because they can act as substrates and/or inhibitors of these transporters. In addition, several TKIs have been identified to be sequestered into lysosomes either due to their physiochemical properties or via ABC transporters expressed on the lysosomal membrane. Since the development of MDR represents a great concern in anticancer treatment, it is important to elucidate the interactions of TKIs with MDR-related transporters as well as to improve the properties that would prevent TKIs from diffusing into lysosomes. These findings not only help to avoid MDR, but also help to define the possible impact of combining TKIs with other anticancer drugs, leading to more efficient therapy and fewer adverse effects in patients.",2020.0,2020-04-30,37,129,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00289fd634585654e19ad05a7b2422ae54ccffa8

Toxicities and resistance are frequently limiting its effectiveness. Immunotherapy has emerged as a safer therapeutic alternative but still has a long way until it has proven to be of equal efficacy. A type of immunotherapy is dendritic cell (DC) vaccination. Aims and Objectives: We have developed a novel platform for the generation of autologous DCs that have been activated against peptides that are personalized for each patient individually. The aim of the study was to clinically evaluate this platform. Materials and Methods: Our platform and our algorithm for the determination of the immunogenic peptides has been tested. DC generation was verified both morphologically and by CD80/86 expression. Peptide antigenicity was determined using a number of T-cell epitope prediction algorithms. Response to therapy was evaluated using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria by the doctors involved. Immune status was also evaluated before and after DC vaccination and correlated with circulated tumor cell count. Results: It was found that DC vaccine increased immune activation while correlated with decreased circulating tumor cell counts. Clinical evaluation by the determination of immune markers may be a superior tool than using RECIST criteria.

10.2478/sjph-2024-0008,Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Slovenian Breast Cancer Survivors Post-Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study,"ABSTRACT Background Although anxiety and depression are important determinants of mental health, the literature in this area is sparse as most studies focus on the period during treatment. Mental health problems can affect cancer recovery as well as quality of life and survival. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the prevalence of anxiety and depression in Slovenian cancer survivors after treatment and assessed the associated correlates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From September 2021 to January 2022, we collected data from 430 breast cancer survivors one to five years after receiving post-local treatment and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure anxiety and depression levels. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify factors associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Results Key findings from this study are increased levels of psychological distress and identification of relevant factors associated with those elevated levels. Approximately one-third of breast cancer survivors exhibited symptoms of elevated anxiety and depression, with one in eight meeting clinical thresholds. Multivariate linear regression revealed that age, lower quality of life, heightened fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), reduced resilience, limited social support, and unmet psychosocial and emotional needs correlated with increased anxiety symptoms. Additionally, lower quality of life, higher FCR, diminished resilience, and limited social support were associated with higher depression symptomatology. Conclusions Our study of Slovenian breast cancer survivors one to five years post-treatment observed a significant increase in anxiety and depression symptoms, possibly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The demographic and psychosocial factors identified in this study offer valuable insights for future research. The study emphasises the importance of recognising and addressing the psychological needs of breast cancer survivors and the need to follow them throughout their cancer journey.",2024.0,2024-01-03,2,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00291fa7a7ead038c77edf83ec54bcc9b92a2795

10.3892/ol.2014.1898,Damnacanthal is a potent inducer of apoptosis with anticancer activity by stimulating p53 and p21 genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells,"Damnacanthal, an anthraquinone compound, is isolated from the roots of Morinda citrifolia L. (noni), which has been used for traditional therapy in several chronic diseases, including cancer. Although noni has long been consumed in Asian and Polynesian countries, the molecular mechanisms by which it exerts several benefits are starting to emerge. In the present study, the effect of damnacanthal on MCF-7 cell growth regulation was investigated. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with damnacanthal for 72 h indicated an antiproliferative activity. The MTT method confirmed that damnacanthal inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells at the concentration of 8.2 μg/ml for 72 h. In addition, the drug was found to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint in MCF-7 cells by cell cycle analysis. Damnacanthal induced apoptosis, determined by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (PI) dual-labeling, acridine-orange/PI dyeing and caspase-7 expression. Furthermore, damnacanthal-mediated apoptosis involves the sustained activation of p21, leading to the transcription of p53 and the Bax gene. Overall, the present study provided significant evidence demonstrating that p53-mediated damnacanthal induced apoptosis through the activation of p21 and caspase-7.",2014.0,2014-02-20,44,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002962e56b24bc59754976336c8b4a44e9cc9ca1

Initial capacity planning to identify the resources required to support DMTs begins with estimating the number of people with dementia who may be eligible for DMTs. We estimated the potential number of individuals with dementia who are eligible for DMTs using population‐based data in Alberta, Canada. Method We used provincial administrative health databases in Alberta, Canada (population ∼4.5 million) to identify all people newly identified with dementia between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2022 using a validated dementia case ascertainment algorithm. The characteristics of this population were then described at the time of diagnosis including demographics, conditions potentially contributing to the diagnosis of dementia (e.g. stroke, parkinsonism), and medical contraindications to treatment (e.g. cancer, seizures). The characteristics of individuals with dementia were then compared to the inclusion criteria used in AD DMT trials to estimate the proportion of individuals with dementia who may be eligible for DMTs. We then compared the characteristics of individuals who were determined to be eligible for DMTs compared to those who were not eligible. Result A total of 77,479 individuals were identified with incident dementia during the study period with a mean age of 80.6 years and 58% were female. In this group, 15,044/77,479 (19%) had conditions other than AD as a potential cause of their dementia. Medical contraindications to DMTs were present in 24,580/62,435 (39%) of all individuals who had AD as their probable cause of dementia. Overall, 37,855/77,479 (49%) of the entire dementia population could potentially go on to receive biomarker testing to determine DMT eligibility. Individuals who were younger and women were more likely to be potentially eligible for DMTs at the time of dementia diagnosis. Conclusion Approximately half of all people diagnosed with dementia in Alberta could be eligible for DMTs based on their health history. Additional information on cognitive test scores, neuroimaging, and biomarker results are required to further refine estimates of the number of individuals potentially eligible to receive DMTs in Canada.",2024.0,2024-12-01,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002a231a15450f9d966dae5bda8dcdf3f3260e02

10.25259/IJPC_232_2024,Outcomes of Specialist Palliative Care Consultation for Patients with Advanced Cancer in an Oncological Emergency Department: A Retrospective Analysis,"Objectives: Research on palliative care (PC) consultation and its outcomes in the emergency department (ED) within a low-and middle-income country (LMIC) setting is limited. This study aimed to evaluate PC consultation outcomes, symptom burden and management, and referral patterns in patients with advanced cancer referred for specialist PC (SPC) in the ED of an urban tertiary care cancer centre in India. Materials and Methods: Data of adult advanced cancer patients referred for SPC services in the ED between August 2017 and June 2019 were retrospectively screened. Patients’ sociodemographic features, clinical characteristics, ED visit-related data, and treatment-related data were documented. Multinomial logistic regression, incorporating significant univariate factors, was performed to analyse the independent predictive factors of consultation outcomes in the ED. Results: Of the 644 consultations, 366 (56.8%) were discharged home, 166 (25.8%) were admitted to various settings (hospital/respite care/hospice), 74 (11.5%) died in the ED, and 38 (5.9%) were unresponsive upon arrival. Sex, performance status (PS), gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events, pain, cancer progression, and receipt of pharmacological treatment were predictive of consultation outcomes. Male patients and those with poor PS were more likely to be admitted to the ED, whereas patients with poor PS and cancer progression were more likely to die. Discharge rates were higher among females, those with gastrointestinal symptoms and pain, and those receiving pharmacological treatment. Conclusion: More than 50% of the patients referred for SPC consultations were discharged. In addition, we also identified predictors for each consultation outcome in the LMIC-ED setting. Future research should investigate advanced care planning and survival analyses in comparable ED settings.",2025.0,2025-01-24,0,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002a864444bcd0b8779a3c0a6599acc6b36de04f

Revealing the distribution of HPV prevalence and types in cervical cancer remains important for both treatment and vaccination strategies. The goal of this study is to determine the HPV DNA subtypes of women who are positive for Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) screening, and to evaluate their sociodemographic characteristics and cervical smear results. 
Methods: The study was conducted on 215 women who were directed to Sivas Cumhuriyet University Obstetry and Gynocology outpatient clinic by her gynocologists or family physicians between 2015-2018 years. A questionnary containing datas of patients about age, education levels and jobs of both spouses, smoking status, obstetric history and age of first sexual intercourse was filled out by the researcher. The data were analysed with SPSS (vers 23.0) program and significance level was taken as 0.05. 
Results: The most prevalent HPV types were type 16 and category of the others; with the rates of respectively 47% (n: 101), 40% (n: 86). The frequencies of ASCUS (undetermined atypical squamous epithelial cells), LGSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and HGSIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) were respectively found to be 7.9% (n: 17), 23.7% (n: 51) and 1.9% (n: 4). The relationship between HPV types and Pap Smear results was statistically significant (p: 0.011). There was no difference between patients and their spouses about education levels and occupations; and among patients on smoking status, menstrual patterns, age at first sexual intercourse and family planning methods and HPV types (p> 0.05). In women above aged 55, only two types of HPV DNA were observed; which were type 16 and category of the others (p: 0.005). The relationship between abortion history and HPV types was found out to be significant (p: 0.016).

Methods: In a screening of 1193 consecutive patients diagnosed with ESCC and received radiotherapy, 53 patients presenting synchronous MPC in the upper digestive tract were retrospectively investigated. 53 consecutive patients with esophageal non-multiple primary cancer (NPC), matched by stage, age and sex, served as control. All of the patients received concurrent CRT. The median radiation dose was 60 Gy. Chemotherapy regimens were based on platinum and/or 5-fluorouracil. Clinical outcomes and treatment toxicities were compared. Results: Clinic-pathologic characteristics were well balanced between groups. MPC mostly located in esophagus (43, 81.8%), followed by hypopharynx (8, 15.1%) and stomach (2, 3.8%). In MPC and NPC patients, 94.3% and 96.2% completed the intended treatment. The immediate response rate was 73.6% vs 75.5%, with complete response rate of 11.3% vs 24.5% and partial response rate of 62.3% vs 51.0%. Two-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS) and distant progression-free survival (DPFS) were 52.2% vs 68.9% (p=0.026), 32.9% vs 54.0% (p=0.032), 60.8% vs 87.8% (p=0.002) and 64.0% vs 70.8% (p=0.22), respectively. Acute grade 3-4 toxicities were observed in 64.2% vs 54.7%, significantly higher in radiation esophagitis (49.1% vs 28.3%, p<0.001), and mucositis (11.3% vs 00p=0.027). Conclusions: Compared with matched NPC, ESCC accompanied with synchronous MPC was related to significantly impaired survival, elevated risk of locoregional disease progression and higher incidence of severe esophagitis and mucositis, following concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Future study on reasons for decreased efficacy of chemoradiotherapy will help to optimize treatment. Advanced radiation techniques may play a role in protecting normal tissues and reduce acute toxicities.",2017.0,2017-02-11,14,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002b21a792760490061cdede88398c6ac2595907

10.2147/IJN.S3801,Enhanced osteoblast adhesion on nanostructured selenium compacts for anti-cancer orthopedic applications,"Metallic bone implants possess numerous problems limiting their long-term efficacy, such as poor prolonged osseointegration, stress shielding, and corrosion under in vivo environments. Such problems are compounded for bone cancer patients since numerous patients receive orthopedic implants after cancerous bone resection. Unfortunately, current orthopedic materials were not originally developed to simultaneously increase healthy bone growth (as in traditional orthopedic implant applications) while inhibiting cancerous bone growth. The long-term objective of the present research is to investigate the use of nano-rough selenium to prevent bone cancer from re-occurring while promoting healthy bone growth for this select group of cancer patients. Selenium is a well known anti-cancer chemical. However, what is not known is how healthy bone cells interact with selenium. To determine this, selenium, spherical or semispherical shots, were pressed into cylindrical compacts and these compacts were then etched using 1N NaOH to obtain various surface structures ranging from the micron, submicron to nano scales. Changes in surface chemistry were also analyzed. Through these etching techniques, results of this study showed that biologically inspired surface roughness values were created on selenium compacts to match that of natural bone roughness. Moreover, results showed that healthy bone cell adhesion increased with greater nanometer selenium roughness (more closely matching that of titanium). In this manner, this study suggests that nano-rough selenium should be further tested for orthopedic applications involving bone cancer treatment.",2008.0,2008-09-01,51,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002b4b8cd6c6d44f991674b975533d541859052a

10.1111/cpr.13570,Cisplatin‐induced oxPAPC release enhances MDSCs infiltration into LL2 tumour tissues through MCP‐1/CCL2 and LTB4/LTB4R pathways,"Lung cancer is the leading global cause of cancer‐related death, however, resistance to chemotherapy drugs remains a huge barrier to effective treatment. The elevated recruitment of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to tumour after chemotherapy has been linked to resistance of chemotherapy drugs. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism remains unclear. oxPAPC is a bioactive principal component of minimally modified low‐density lipoproteins and regulates inflammatory response. In this work, we found that cisplatin, oxaliplatin and ADM all increased oxPAPC release in tumour. Treating macrophages with oxPAPC in vitro stimulated the secretion of MCP‐1 and LTB4, which strongly induced monocytes and neutrophils chemotaxis, respectively. Injection of oxPAPC in vivo significantly upregulated the percentage of MDSCs in tumour microenvironment (TME) of wild‐type LL2 tumour‐bearing mice, but not CCL2−/− mice and LTB4R−/− mice. Critically, oxPAPC acted as a pro‐tumor factor in LL2 tumour model. Indeed, cisplatin increased oxPAPC level in tumour tissues of WT mice, CCL2−/− and LTB4R−/− mice, but caused increased infiltration of Ly6Chigh monocytes and neutrophils only in WT LL2‐bearing mice. Collectively, our work demonstrates cisplatin treatment induces an overproduction of oxPAPC and thus recruits MDSCs infiltration to promote the tumour growth through the MCP‐1/CCL2 and LTB4/LTB4R pathways, which may restrict the effect of multiple chemotherapy. This provides evidence for a potential strategy to enhance the efficacy of multiple chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of lung cancer by targeting oxPAPC.",2023.0,2023-10-31,3,63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002bcd558fce53f9f9d1e5063f764f01317ebde5

This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of lncRNAs for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer. To this end, the processed data of The Cancer Genome Atlas LUAD were retrieved from GEPIA and circlncRNAnet databases, matched with each other and integrated with the analysis results of a non‐small cell lung cancer plasma RNA‐Seq study. Then, the data were filtered in order to separate the differentially expressed lncRNAs that have a prognostic value for LUAD. Finally, the selected lncRNAs were functionally annotated using a bioinformatic and systems biology approach. Accordingly, we identified 19 lncRNAs as the novel LUAD prognostic lncRNAs. Also, based on our results, all 19 lncRNAs might be involved in lung cancer‐related biological processes. Overall, we suggested several novel biomarkers and drug targets which could help early diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of LUAD patients.",2019.0,2019-06-18,16,86,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002bda26a157be0ffe67f5435ec316cef6b44f10

This syndrome is usually reversible and is associated with hypertension, nephropathy, and use of immunosuppressive medication and cytotoxic agents. We describe two rare cases of RPLS occurring in colorectal cancer, both of which presented with coma, that we believe can be directly attributed to bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the angiogenesis of tumours by specifically blocking vascular endothelial growth factor. We analysed the clinical features, risk factors and outcomes of RPLS in these two patients, and although no typical finding was identified on imaging examination, we found that inadequate blood pressure control was one of the risk factors leading to RPLS and that supportive treatment including intensive blood pressure control improved outcomes. Due to the increasing use of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer, clinicians should be aware of this potential complication.",2014.0,2014-06-07,15,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002bff13aa1fa2404ef305cc33b3a98747d4eb29

10.21037/jgo-23-757,Particle therapy in gastrointestinal cancer—a narrative review,"Background and Objective Radiation therapy is one of the main pillars in the treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, especially esophageal and anorectal malignancies. The worldwide standard of care is yet an irradiation with photons. Though not commonly used, charged particles offer some physical advantages with a highly conformal dose distribution, which allows an even better sparing of organs at risk. In addition to dosimetric advantages, heavy-ion beams like carbon ions may offer an additional set of biological advantages. Because particle therapy is not standard of care, data are scarce—especially concerning the use in GI malignancies. The aim of this review is to provide a compact overview of the currently available literature. Methods PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for publications on particle radiotherapy in GI cancer (e.g., proton therapy in esophageal cancer, carbon ion radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer). Key Content and Findings Here we present a review of the current data on particle therapy with regard to esophageal, pancreatic, hepatic and anorectal malignancies. Conclusions Data on particle therapy in GI cancer are scarce. Nevertheless, the current literature shows some promising results. Further clinical evidence, especially randomized trials, is crucial to augment the role of particle radiotherapy in GI cancer.",2023.0,2023-01-01,0,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002cf0723036d19159922721b0c41d13a5d6e538

10.3322/caac.21556,Minimizing the burden of cancer in the United States: Goals for a high‐performing health care system,"Between 1991 and 2015, the cancer mortality rate declined dramatically in the United States, reflecting improvements in cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship care. However, cancer outcomes in the United States vary substantially between populations defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, and geographic area of residence. Many potentially preventable cancer deaths occur in individuals who did not receive effective cancer prevention, screening, treatment, or survivorship care. At the same time, cancer care spending is large and growing, straining national, state, health insurance plans, and family budgets. Indeed, one of the most pressing issues in American medicine is how to ensure that all populations, in every community, derive the benefit from scientific research that has already been completed. Addressing these questions from the perspective of health care delivery is necessary to accelerate the decline in cancer mortality that began in the early 1990s. This article, part of the Cancer Control Blueprint series, describes challenges with the provision of care across the cancer control continuum in the United States. It also identifies goals for a high‐performing health system that could reduce disparities and the burden of cancer by promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles; access to a regular source of primary care; timely access to evidence‐based care; patient‐centeredness, including effective patient‐provider communication; enhanced coordination and communication between providers, including primary care and specialty care providers; and affordability for patients, payers, and society.",2019.0,2019-05-01,97,140,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002d0f6cdc42a2d43106edc6d8e9161c3b3a50ee
10.1002/adtp.202300007,Enzyme‐Based Synthetic Protein Nanoparticles as Colloidal Antioxidants,"Protein‐based drug delivery systems have gained popularity due to their biocompatibility, straightforward surface modification, and potential for intrinsic therapeutic activity. Among therapeutic proteins, enzymes are particularly attractive because of their specificity, efficient reaction rates, regeneration after substrate turnover, and proven track record in the treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to inherited metabolic and lysosomal storage disorders. Herein, previous work on electrohydrodynamic jetting is expanded upon by developing a novel class of protein nanoparticles that features therapeutic enzymes. In particular, nanoparticles incorporating the antioxidant enzyme, catalase, at weight fractions as high as 50% are reported. Catalase‐based synthetic protein nanoparticles (CAT‐SPNPs) demonstrate sustained antioxidative activity, retain significantly enhanced enzymatic activity compared to its solute form, and overall demonstrate good structural stability. Moreover, surface functionalization of CAT‐SPNPs with targeting antibodies results in ≈12.5‐fold increase in uptake over unmodified control particles. Importantly, CAT‐SPNPs exert protection from oxidative stress, as indicated by significant increase in viability and reduction in LDH release compared to equivalent amounts of free catalase. Taken together, the work establishes targeted enzyme‐based SPNPs as a platform for enhancing the drug‐like properties of therapeutic enzymes.",2023.0,2023-07-08,2,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002d284b2fdfa6d90c34d95d809982b8ee4cb303

10.3390/pharmaceutics14010077,TYMS 3′-UTR Polymorphism: A Novel Association with FOLFIRINOX-Induced Neurotoxicity in Pancreatic Cancer Patients,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly fatal malignancy that has the worst 5-year survival rate of all of the common malignant tumors. Surgery, chemotherapy, and/or chemoradiation remain the main tactics for PDAC treatment. The efficacy of chemotherapy is often compromised because of the substantial risk of severe toxicities. In our study, we focused on identification of polymorphisms in the genes involved in drug metabolism, DNA repair and replication that are associated with inter-individual differences in drug-induced toxicities. Using the microarray, we genotyped 12 polymorphisms in the DPYD, XPC, GSTP1, MTHFR, ERCC1, UGT1A1, and TYMS genes in 78 PDAC patients treated with FOLFIRINOX. It was found that the TYMS rs11280056 polymorphism (6 bp-deletion in TYMS 3′-UTR) predicted grade 1–2 neurotoxicity (p = 0.0072 and p = 0.0019, according to co-dominant (CDM) and recessive model (RM), respectively). It is the first report on the association between TYMS rs11280056 and peripheral neuropathy. We also found that PDAC patients carrying the GSTP1 rs1695 GG genotype had a decreased risk for grade 3–4 hematological toxicity as compared to those with the AA or AG genotypes (p = 0.032 and p = 0.014, CDM and RM, respectively). Due to relatively high p-values, we consider that the impact of GSTP1 rs1695 requires further investigation in a larger sample size.",2021.0,2021-12-29,3,66,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002d4d613ce6c85029c14878cf12dc960eaa8fe5

10.1371/journal.pone.0177043,Effect of chronic estradiol plus progesterone treatment on experimental arterial and venous thrombosis in mouse,"Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen plus progestogens is the first line therapy to treat menopausal symptoms. The progestogen is added to estrogen to reduce or eliminate the excess risk of endometrial cancer due to the unopposed effect of estrogen. Whereas progestin clearly opposes the proliferative and deleterious long-term actions of estrogen on the endometrium, the interference of progestin on the other estrogen action remains unclear. We previously reported that chronic subcutaneous 17α-estradiol (E2) in mice decreases platelet responsiveness, prolongs the tail-bleeding time and protects against acute thromboembolism. Here, we report the tissue-specific interference of progesterone (P4) on the action of E2 in ovariectomized mice. We first confirm that, in our experimental conditions, P4 attenuates the proliferative action of E2 on the uterus and the effects of E2 on vagina weight and lubrication. We then studied the effect of E2 combined with P4 on hemostasis and thrombosis in vivo in mice and found that P4 did not interfere with the main actions of E2 on platelets, bleeding time and arterial and venous thrombosis. Thus, whereas activation of progesterone receptor interferes with the action of E2 on its classic sex targets, P4 appears to have minimal effect on the hemostasis and thrombosis actions of E2, supporting the prominent role of estrogens and the accessory role of natural progestin on the extra-reproductive cells and tissues involved in thrombosis.",2017.0,2017-05-09,16,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002d75a40de6cece73e8cdf43b7268eefdd132ee

10.7150/thno.78649,Low-dose X-ray radiodynamic therapy solely based on gold nanoclusters for efficient treatment of deep hypoxic solid tumors combined with enhanced antitumor immune response,"Background: Radiodynamic therapy (RDT) is an emerging novel anti-cancer treatment based on the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the lesion site following the interaction between low-dose X-ray and a photosensitizer (PS) drug. For a classical RDT, scintillator nanomaterials loaded with traditional PSs are generally involved to generate singlet oxygen (1O2). However, this scintillator-mediated strategy generally suffers from insufficient energy transfer efficiency and the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, and finally severely impedes the efficacy of RDT. Methods: Gold nanoclusters were irradiated by low dose of X-ray (called RDT) to investigate the production of ROS, killing efficiency of cell level and living body level, antitumor immune mechanism and biosafety. Results: A novel dihydrolipoic acid coated gold nanoclusters (AuNC@DHLA) RDT, without additional scintillator or photosensitizer assisted, has been developed. In contrast to scintillator-mediated strategy, AuNC@DHLA can directly absorb the X-ray and exhibit excellent radiodynamic performance. More importantly, the radiodynamic mechanism of AuNC@DHLA involves electron-transfer mode resulting in O2-• and HO•, and excess ROS has been generated even under hypoxic conditions. Highly efficient in vivo treatment of solid tumors had been achieved via only single drug administration and low-dose X-ray radiation. Interestingly, enhanced antitumor immune response was involved, which could be effective against tumor recurrence or metastasis. Negligible systemic toxicity was also observed as a consequence of the ultra-small size of AuNC@DHLA and rapid clearance from body after effective treatment. Conclusions: Highly efficient in vivo treatment of solid tumors had been achieved, enhanced antitumor immune response and negligible systemic toxicity were observed. Our developed strategy will further promote the cancer therapeutic efficiency under low dose X-ray radiation and hypoxic conditions, and bring hope for clinical cancer treatment.",2023.0,2023-01-22,18,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002e10019e63607a30b666b97f7bb5c2e7e9681c

10.3390/cells11223580,Targeting Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Exacerbates Ferroptosis and Increases the Efficacy of Melanoma Immunotherapy via the Regulation of MITF,"Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, resulting from the malignant transformation of epidermal melanocytes. Recent revolutionary progress in targeted therapy and immunotherapy has prominently improved the treatment outcome, but the survival of melanoma patients remains suboptimal. Ferroptosis is greatly involved in cancer pathogenesis and can execute the outcome of immunotherapy. However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms of melanoma cell ferroptosis remain elusive. Herein, we report that Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates ferroptosis and melanoma immunotherapy efficacy via the regulation of MITF. First of all, we found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was prominently suppressed in melanoma cell ferroptosis. Then, we proved that targeting β-catenin exacerbated melanoma cell ferroptosis by promoting the generation of lipid peroxidation both in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that MITF mediated the effect of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on melanoma cell ferroptosis, and PGC1α and SCD1 were documented as two main effectors downstream of Wnt/β-catenin-MITF pathway. Ultimately, pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin or MITF increased the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in preclinical xenograft tumor model by promoting ferroptosis. Taken together, Wnt/β-catenin signaling deficiency exacerbates ferroptosis in melanoma via the regulation of MITF. Targeting Wnt/β-catenin-MITF pathway could be a promising strategy to potentiate ferroptosis and increase the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",2022.0,2022-11-01,31,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002ee5839646153e1af0ac85a10354fc2b120b65

This study analyzed 103 cases of oral lesions, comparing cytology, a fast minimally invasive diagnostic method, with histopathology, the gold standard for diagnosis. Cytology demonstrated high accuracy (87.4%) in distinguishing cancerous from non-cancerous lesions and showed complete agreement with histopathology in most cases (65%). However, some discrepancies arose, often due to challenges such as an inadequate sample quality or the inability of cytology to assess tissue architecture. Despite these limitations, cytology proved to be an invaluable first diagnostic step, offering veterinarians a rapid and cost-effective tool to guide early treatment decisions. By identifying potential cancers at an earlier stage, cytology contributes to improve outcomes for pets.

10.3390/molecules27196401,A Mini Review on Molecules Inducing Caspase-Independent Cell Death: A New Route to Cancer Therapy,"Most anticancer treatments trigger tumor cell death through apoptosis, where initiation of proteolytic action of caspase protein is a basic need. But under certain circumstances, apoptosis is prevented by the apoptosis inhibitor proteins, survivin and Hsp70. Several drugs focusing on classical programmed death of the cell have been reported to have low anti-tumorogenic potency due to mutations in proteins involved in the caspase-dependent programmed cell death with intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. This review concentrates on the role of anti-cancer drug molecules targeting alternative pathways of cancer cell death for treatment, by providing a molecular basis for the new strategies of novel anti-cancer treatment. Under these conditions, active agents targeting alternative cell death pathways can be considered as potent chemotherapeutic drugs. Many natural compounds and other small molecules, such as inorganic and synthetic compounds, including several repurposing drugs, are reported to cause caspase-independent cell death in the system. However, few molecules indicated both caspase-dependent as well caspase-free cell death in specific cancer lines. Cancer cells have alternative methods of caspase-independent programmed cell death which are equally promising for being targeted by small molecules. These small molecules may be useful leads for rational therapeutic drug design, and can be of potential interest for future cancer-preventive strategies.",2022.0,2022-09-28,28,99,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002f90125ced538db4c0913fca962d74f2d5df5f

Surgery is usually the first line of treatment for patients with CRC but many tumors with similar histopathological features show significantly different clinical outcomes. The discovery of robust prognostic biomarkers in patients with CRC is imperative to achieve more effective treatment strategies and improve patient's care. Recent progress in next generation sequencing methods and transcriptome analysis has revealed that a much larger part of the genome is transcribed into RNA than previously assumed. Collectively referred to as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), some of these RNA molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be altered and to play critical roles in tumor biology. This discovery leads to exciting possibilities for personalized cancer diagnosis, and therapy. Many lncRNAs are tissue and cancer-type specific and have already revealed to be useful as prognostic markers. In this review, we focus on recent findings concerning aberrant expression of lncRNAs in CRC tumors and emphasize their prognostic potential in CRC. Further studies focused on the mechanisms of action of lncRNAs will contribute to the development of novel biomarkers for diagnosis and disease progression.",2016.0,2016-04-12,68,143,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002fa73fa756cc37cb918f4e13e6421adf4dad51
10.1371/journal.pone.0079615,Bone Marrow-Derived Cells May Not Be the Original Cells for Carcinogen-Induced Mouse Gastrointestinal Carcinomas,"Aim It has been reported that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) can be original cells of mouse gastric cancers induced by Helicobacter felis (H. felis) infection. However, it is unknown whether BMDCs are also the original cells of mouse gastrointestinal cancers induced by gastric carcinogens N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) and H. felis infection. Methods C57BL/6 recipient mice were initially irradiated with 10Gy X-ray, reconstituted with bone marrow cells from the C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-EGFP) donor mice to label BMDCs with green fluorescence protein (GFP). After 4 weeks of recovery, the bone marrow-transplanted mice were given NMU in drinking water (240 ppm) and subsequently infected with H. felis by gavage. Eighty weeks later, all mice were euthanized for pathological examination. The BMDCs expressing GFP were detected in tissues using direct GFP fluorescence confocal microscopy analysis and immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) assays. Results Neoplastic lesions were induced by NMU treatment and/or H. felis infection at the antrum of the glandular stomach and small intestine. In the direct GFP fluorescence confocal assay, GFP(+) epithelial cell cluster or glands were not observed in these gastrointestinal tumors, however, most GFP(+) BMDCs sporadically located in the tumor stromal tissues. Some of these GFP(+) stromal BMDCs co-expressed the hematopoietic marker CD45 or myofibroblasts markers αSMA and SRF. In the indirect GFP IHC assay, similar results were observed among 11 gastric intraepithelial neoplasia lesions and 2 small intestine tumors. Conclusion These results demonstrated that BMDCs might not be the source of gastrointestinal tumor cells induced by NMU and/or H. felis infection.",2013.0,2013-11-19,7,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002faccdd4e70c4f286d173a54f385f189e15b4c

10.51847/kwrunlz2qm,Maxillofacial Surgeons Perception of Frequency Need for Fellowship Programs for Advanced Oral Cancer in Saudi Arabia,"Oral cancer ranks 16th worldwide. Saudi Arabia's OC rate is rising. This shows the need for oral cancer specialists. Oral and maxillofacial surgery residents cannot participate in head and neck surgical oncology and reconstructive surgery fellowship programs. No study has examined the attitude of maxillofacial surgeons, who usually are the first to encounter oral cancer, on the need for fellowship training programs in this field and that is the purpose of this study. An anonymous web-based survey was conducted, consisting of 7 questions to evaluate the current perception among practitioners on the frequency of advanced oral cancer cases, the need for a specialized training program, and the interest of these practitioners in enrolling in such a program. The survey was distributed to OMFS practitioners in different regions of Saudi Arabia. 78 practitioners completed the survey, most of whom were consultants, 49.4%. When the practitioners commented on the statement of frequently encountering oral cancer at an advanced stage due to delay in diagnosis or treatment, 43.6% strongly agreed, and 41% agreed. An overwhelming majority of practitioners believed that there is a need for oral cancer fellowship programs in Saudi Arabia, 97.4% and 61.5% of them expressed interest in applying for such a fellowship. Several Saudi Arabian institutions lack professionals skilled in advanced oral cancer surgery, and no fellowship programs in oral and maxillofacial surgery exist. OMFS practitioners are eager for fellowship training, particularly in surgical oncology.",2023.0,,0,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002fe38c8811e069d8a652800b7b60defb4941a3
10.3109/02813432.2015.1132886,Prevalence of comorbidity in primary care patients with type 2 diabetes and its association with elevated HbA1c: A cross-sectional study in Croatia,"Abstract Objective To the authors’ knowledge, there are few valid data that describe the prevalence of comorbidity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients seen in family practice. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of comorbidities and their association with elevated (≥ 7.0%) haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) using a large sample of T2DM patients from primary care practices. Design A cross-sectional study in which multivariate logistic regression was applied to explore the association of comorbidities with elevated HbA1c. Setting Primary care practices in Croatia. Subjects Altogether, 10 264 patients with diabetes in 449 practices. Main outcome measures Comorbidities and elevated HbA1c. Results In total 7979 (77.7%) participants had comorbidity. The mean number of comorbidities was 1.6 (SD 1.28). Diseases of the circulatory system were the most common (7157, 69.7%), followed by endocrine and metabolic diseases (3093, 30.1%), and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (1437, 14.0%). After adjustment for age and sex, the number of comorbidities was significantly associated with HbA1c. The higher the number of comorbidities, the lower the HbA1c. The prevalence of physicians’ inertia was statistically significantly and negatively associated with the number of comorbidities (Mann–Whitney U test, Z = –12.34; p < 0.001; r = –0.12). Conclusion There is a high prevalence of comorbidity among T2DM patients in primary care. A negative association of number of comorbidities and HbA1c is probably moderated by physicians’ inertia in treatment of T2DM strictly according to guidelines. Key points There is a high prevalence of comorbidity among T2DM patients in primary care. Patients with breast cancer, obese patients, and those with dyslipidaemia and ischaemic heart disease were more likely to have increased HbA1c. The higher the number of comorbidities, the lower the HbA1c.",2016.0,2016-01-02,18,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002ffb66a1be98484624af6033bf780a98126b04

10.3390/cancers15194699,Prediction of Maxillary Bone Invasion in Hard Palate/Upper Alveolus Cancer: A Multi-Center Retrospective Study,"Simple Summary Pathological bone invasion is an independent, poor prognostic factor in oral cancer, and accurate prediction of bone invasion is critical to the prognosis estimation and treatment decision. Many previous studies on bone invasion of oral cancer have focused on mandibular invasion, but there have been relatively few reports about the maxillary bone invasion (MBI) of hard palate/upper alveolus (HP/UA) cancer. Therefore, we have attempted to design a prediction model for MBI using several radiological and clinical variables of HP/UA cancer. We found that computerized tomography (CT) alone predicted MBI, with a discrimination ability of 77.9%. Meanwhile, the discrimination performance was increased up to 91.1% in a prediction model including CT findings, tumor dimensions, clinical factors (male sex, nodal metastasis), and maximal standardized uptake value of positron emission tomography/CT. In addition, the scoring system using these variables clearly distinguished low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for MBI in HP/UA cancer. Abstract Background: maxillary bone invasion (MBI) is not uncommon in hard palate or upper alveolus (HP/UA) cancer; however, there have been relatively few reports about the MBI of HP/UA cancer. Patients and Methods: this was a multi-center retrospective study, enrolling 144 cases of HP/UA cancer. MBI was defined by surgical pathology or radiology follow-up. The multiple prediction models for MBI were developed in total cases and in cases having primary bone resection, using clinical and radiological variables. Results: computerized tomography (CT) alone predicted MBI, with an area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.779 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.712–0.847). The AUC was increased in a model that combined tumor dimensions and clinical factors (male sex and nodal metastasis) (0.854 (95%CI = 0.790–0.918)). In patients who underwent 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT), the discrimination performance of a model including the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) had an AUC of 0.911 (95%CI = 0.847–0.975). The scoring system using CT finding, tumor dimension, and clinical factors, with/without PET/CT SUVmax clearly distinguished low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for MBI. Conclusion: using information from CT, tumor dimension, clinical factors, and the SUVmax value, the MBI of HP/UA cancer can be predicted with a relatively high discrimination performance.",2023.0,2023-09-24,0,41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003046444666affcb09eae11d38e066f342574f7

10.1097/jnr.0000000000000323,Chinese Version of the Assessment of Survivor Concerns Scale for Gynecological Cancer Survivors: A Psychometric Study in Taiwan,"ABSTRACT Background: Most gynecological cancer survivors outlive the acute stage, and many reach permanent survival. However, the fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is stressful and affects quality of life. Purpose: This study was designed to validate a Chinese version of the Assessment of Survivor Concerns (ASC) questionnaire in terms of its ability to assess FCR in gynecological cancer survivors. Methods: A two-stage study procedure was employed. The first stage involved the translation of the ASC questionnaire from English into Chinese using the methods proposed by Guillemin, which include translation, back-translation, consensus meetings, and a trial of potential users. In the second stage, a pilot study was completed with 37 gynecological cancer survivors followed by a psychometric property study with 287 gynecological cancer survivors. Construct validity was determined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with structural equation modeling. Convergent validity was determined using composite reliability and the average variance extracted values of the ASC model. Discriminant validity was determined by comparing the model fitness of the ASC model against the model fitness of a one-construct model. Concurrent criterion validity was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 as the auxiliary instrument. Reliability was determined by measuring the internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's α in addition to the 3-week test–retest reliability with a 95% confidence interval of the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: The process of translation and back-translation was performed to ensure the conceptual equivalence of the Chinese version with the original ASC questionnaire. For CFA, the fit indices of the ASC model (χ2 = 9.87, p > .05; root mean square error of approximation = .03. comparative fit index = 1, nonnormed fit index = 1) indicated appropriate model fitness. For convergent validity, the composite reliability and average variance extracted values of the ASC model were satisfactory. For discriminant validity, the model fitness of the ASC model was significantly improved over the one-construct model. For concurrent criterion validity, the ASC scores correlated negatively with the scores of the global quality of life and the five functions (physical, role, cognition, emotions, and social) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30, as hypothesized. For reliability, the Cronbach's α and the 95% confidence interval of intraclass correlation coefficient for the ASC model were .91 and [.18, .68], respectively. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: The Chinese version of the ASC questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument that is suitable for assessing FCR in gynecological cancer survivors in clinical and research settings.",2019.0,2019-09-20,4,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00306d3573db89cd402c1fc53440118b9f784201

Although endoscopic palliation with self-expandable metallic stents has emerged as a safe and effective alternative to surgery, experience with this technique remains limited. In particular, a proximal jejunal obstruction requires more technical expertise than a duodenal obstruction. Palliative treatment modalities include both surgical and nonsurgical approaches. In this report, we describe the successful placement of self-expandable metallic stents at the proximal jejunum using a combination of percutaneous endoscopic, intraoperative, and transstomal stenting. Usually endoscopy is not indicated in cases of proximal jejunal obstruction, but some cases may require palliative endoscopy instead of bypass operation.",2009.0,2009-04-15,5,6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00308713a2ed479f8d078f4ee8735da6682f8f0c
10.18632/oncotarget.12544,Age at diagnosis indicated poor prognosis in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
Effect of age at diagnosis on treatment failure and mortality was rarely evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.


METHODS
We analyzed 1252 patients staged III-IVb and underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Age was categorized as 20 to 49 years (n=804), 50 to 59 years (n=282) and 60 years or older (n=166). Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS) and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS) were assessed by age group.


RESULTS
The 4-years DMFS decreased with age group (86.7% [20-49 years], 86.7% [50-59 years], 77.1% [≥60 years]; P=0.014); likewise, 4-years CSS were 91.0%, 87.4% and 74.2% (P<0.001); 4-years OS were 90.8%, 87.4% and 73.6% (P<0.001), respectively. In multivariate analysis, compared with patients aged 20 to 49 years, DMFS decreased with age for patients aged 50 to 59 years (HR=1.10, 95% CI 0.77-1.57) and aged 60 years or older (HR=1.75, 95% CI 1.20-2.56) (P=0.015). Similarly, both CSS and OS were inferior in patients aged 50 to 59 years (HR=1.77, 95% CI 1.25-2.52 for CSS; HR=1.71, 95% CI 1.21-2.43 for OS) and aged 60 or older (HR=3.73, 95% CI 2.63-5.29 for CSS; HR=3.96, 95% CI 2.83-5.54 for OS) (P<0.001). Yet age did not affect LRFS in univariate and multivariate analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
Increasing age at diagnosis of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma was associated with higher risk of distant metastasis and mortality.",2015.0,2015-07-18,5,20,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0030888c1522e553584c86f9dc835019412d6723
10.1371/journal.pone.0169736,Clinical and Immune Effects of Lenalidomide in Combination with Gemcitabine in Patients with Advanced Pancreatic Cancer,"Purpose To assess the immunomodulatory and clinical effects of lenalidomide with standard treatment of gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients and Methods Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were treated in first line with lenalidomide orally for 21 days of a 28 days cycle and the standard regimen for gemcitabine. In Part I, which we previously have reported, the dose of lenalidomide was defined (n = 12). In Part II, every other consecutive patient was treated with either lenalidomide (Group A, n = 11) or gemcitabine (Group B, n = 10) during cycle 1. From cycle 2 on, all Part II patients received the combination. Results A significant decrease in the proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the frequency of DCs were noted in patients at baseline compared to healthy control donors while the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK-cells and MDSCs were significantly higher in patients compared to controls. In Group A, a significant increase in the absolute numbers of activated (HLA-DR+) CD4 and CD8 T cells and CD8 effector memory T cells (p<0.01) was noted during treatment. A statistical increment in the absolute numbers of Tregs were seen after cycle 1 (p<0.05). The addition of gemcitabine, reduced most lymphocyte subsets (p<0.05). In Group B, the proportion of lymphocytes remained unchanged during the study period. There was no difference in overall survival, progression free survival and survival rate at one year comparing the two groups. Discussion Patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma had impaired immune functions. Lenalidomide augmented T cell reactivities, which were abrogated by gemcitabine. However, addition of lenalidomide to gemcitabine seemed to have no therapeutic impact compared to gemcitabine alone in this non-randomized study.

Despite countries' urgent and tenacious public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease is killing a large number of people. The results of prior studies have not been used by policymakers and programmers due to the presence of conflicting results. As a result, this study was conducted to fill the knowledge gap and develop a research agenda. Objective This study aimed to assess the mortality rate and predictors of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in Ethiopia. Methods Electronic databases were searched to find articles that were conducted using a retrospective cohort study design and published in English up to 2022. The data were extracted using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and exported to StataTM version 17.0 for further analysis. The presence of heterogeneity was assessed and presented using a forest plot. The subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias were computed to identify the source of heterogeneity. The pool COVID-19 mortality rate and its predictors were calculated and identified using the random effects meta-analysis model, respectively. The significant predictors identified were reported using a relative risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Seven studies with 31,498 participants were included. The pooled mortality rate of COVID-19 was 9.13 (95% CI: 5.38, 12.88) per 1,000 person-days of mortality-free observation. Those study participants who had chronic kidney disease had 2.29 (95% CI: 1.14, 4.60) times higher chance of experiencing mortality than their corresponding counterparts, diabetics had 2.14 (95% CI: 1.22, 3.76), HIV patients had 2.98 (95% CI: 1.26, 7.03), hypertensive patients had 1.63 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.85), and smoker had 2.35 (95% CI: 1.48, 3.73). Conclusion COVID-19 mortality rate was high to tackle the epidemic of the disease in Ethiopia. COVID-19 patients with chronic renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and HIV were the significant predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients in Ethiopia.

It is critical to research technostress influence on online learning behaviours among undergraduates. Thus, this research intends to examine the predicting factors that contribute to technostress and the correlation between undergraduates’ technostress and the behavioural intention to use online learning.
Methodology – This study employed an online survey and cross-sectional data towards 212 respondents, all of whom were Diploma students from Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Pahang. This study added three new variables to the existing Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) namely teaching-related aspects, price value, and technostress.

The unit of analysis is all official county government websites in the United States. In particular, we investigate if there is a correlation between the overall partisanship of a county and whether a county government's website (1) mentions COVID-19 and (2) provides safety instructions concerning COVID-19. We hypothesize that mass partisanship will impact the probability that a county government's website provides information related to the coronavirus. We find that a larger share of Democratic voters in a county is associated with an increase in the probability that a county government's website mentions COVID-19 and provides safety instructions for its residents. The results hold even after controlling for population density, internet subscriptions and COVID-19 cases and deaths. The finding indicates that citizens’ access to information, even on matters of public health, are partially a consequence of partisanship.",2020.0,2020-10-12,15,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000166fdacb4ec9c85baf65a0437e29b43a95637

This study aimed to estimate the epidemiologic parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic for clinical and epidemiological help. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis study, 4 electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for the literature published from early December 2019 up to 23 March 2020. After screening, we selected 76 articles based on epidemiological parameters, including basic reproduction number, serial interval, incubation period, doubling time, growth rate, case-fatality rate, and the onset of symptom to hospitalization as eligibility criteria. For the estimation of overall pooled epidemiologic parameters, fixed and random effect models with 95% CI were used based on the value of between-study heterogeneity (I2). Results: A total of 76 observational studies were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate for R0 was 2.99 (95% CI, 2.71-3.27) for COVID-19. The overall R0 was 3.23, 1.19, 3.6, and 2.35 for China, Singapore, Iran, and Japan, respectively. The overall serial interval, doubling time, and incubation period were 4.45 (95% CI, 4.03-4.87), 4.14 (95% CI, 2.67-5.62), and 4.24 (95% CI, 3.03-5.44) days for COVID-19. In addition, the overall estimation for the growth rate and the case fatality rate for COVID-19 was 0.38% and 3.29%, respectively. Conclusion: The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 as an emerging disease may be revealed by computing the pooled estimate of the epidemiological parameters, opening the door for health policymakers to consider additional control measures.",2022.0,2022-12-19,6,98,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000223d614e962f001cf97bb030f8c11964ae0be

10.4103/jgid.jgid_397_20,COVID-19 Blind Spots: A Consensus Statement on the Importance of Competent Political Leadership and the Need for Public Health Cognizance,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, important discoveries and considerations emerge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pathogen; its biological and epidemiological characteristics; and the corresponding psychological, societal, and public health (PH) impacts. During the past year, the global community underwent a massive transformation, including the implementation of numerous nonpharmacological interventions; critical diversions or modifications across various spheres of our economic and public domains; and a transition from consumption-driven to conservation-based behaviors. Providing essential necessities such as food, water, health care, financial, and other services has become a formidable challenge, with significant threats to the existing supply chains and the shortage or reduction of workforce across many sectors of the global economy. Food and pharmaceutical supply chains constitute uniquely vulnerable and critically important areas that require high levels of safety and compliance. Many regional health-care systems faced at least one wave of overwhelming COVID-19 case surges, and still face the possibility of a new wave of infections on the horizon, potentially in combination with other endemic diseases such as influenza, dengue, tuberculosis, and malaria. In this context, the need for an effective and scientifically informed leadership to sustain and improve global capacity to ensure international health security is starkly apparent. Public health “blind spotting,” promulgation of pseudoscience, and academic dishonesty emerged as significant threats to population health and stability during the pandemic. The goal of this consensus statement is to provide a focused summary of such “blind spots” identified during an expert group intense analysis of “missed opportunities” during the initial wave of the pandemic.",2020.0,2020-10-01,14,317,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00029cf53ceb810f6b1f0be691a77f24db3f5f69

Manuel Gea González, en la ciudad de México","Problema: ¿La Pronación, tecnología de Enfermería, produce bienestar en el cuidado a los pacientes COVID-19, en el Hospital General Dr. Manuel Gea González, en la Ciudad de México?   
Objetivo: Analizar la Pronación, como tecnología de Enfermería, que produce bienestar en el cuidado de los pacientes COVID-19, en el Hospital General Dr. Manuel Gea González, en la Ciudad de México.
Marco Teórico: La Pronación es una maniobra utilizada en las Unidades de Cuidados Intensivos, en pacientes que presentan Síndrome de Distrés Respiratorio Agudo (SDRA) cuando la hipoxemia es severa. Los sustentos bibliográficos son sólidos para la aplicación de esta maniobra por la mejora que produce en la oxigenación y el aumento en la supervivencia de estos pacientes.
Metodología: Estudio de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, transversal, prolectivo, descriptivo. La variable medida fue la Pronación, como tecnología de Enfermería. El Universo fueron 530 profesionales de Enfermería que trabajan en el Hospital, la Población y la muestra fueron 52 Especialistas de Enfermería que trabajan con pacientes COVID-19.
Resultados: En relación a la capacitación y experiencia en Pronación, el 50% del personal manifiestan que sí recibieron suficiente capacitación sobre el Virus SARS-CoV-2, aunque siguen capacitándose en ésta área; el 84.62% consideran que en la Pronación, los pacientes mejoran muchísimo, saturando entre el 80 y 100% de oxígeno y el 80.77% piensan que siempre cuidan que los pacientes no tengan úlceras por presión.
Discusión: El 50.01% del personal entrevistado manifiesta que sÍ recibió suficiente capacitación sobre la Covid para pronar a los pacientes, lo que es semejante a la investigación de Hernández G. D. y Cols quienes refieren que fue necesario contar con un equipo capacitado específicamente en la maniobra y que deben ser preferentemente Enfermeras Especialistas en Cuidados Intensivos.
 Conclusiones: La ventilación en posición Prono es una medida de protección pulmonar utilizada hace más de 30 años que produce una mejoría evidente y sostenida de la oxigenación de la sangre y en la fisiología respiratoria, por lo que los Especialistas de Enfermería que atiendes pacientes COVID-19 recomiendan su aplicación.",2022.0,2022-04-08,0,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00032a9b9eb8fea581ea16fa59213a116dd3ea87
10.1590/0102-469849142t,METHODOLOGY FOR USING DIGITAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE STUDENTS’ SOCIO-EMOTIONAL SKILLS DEVELOPMENT,"ABSTRACT: To mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazilian educational institutions were closed and interrupted their in-person activities in March 2020, affecting almost 100% of the Brazilian student population, and accelerating the adoption of virtual classes in elementary school. This measure forced students to shift from face-to-face to virtual classes, resulting in a shift to virtual classes for almost all students. This abrupt interruption of face-to-face classes affected social interaction and cooperation among students. Due to this scenario, this research-study focused on improving virtual classes using Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICTs). The study proposed four methodological stages: analysis of socio-emotional skills during the use of DICTs, and the design of digital activities and tasks that would enhance social interaction and the improvement of elementary students’ focus from the perspective of elementary school teachers. The method was implemented and validated through results that demonstrated that the use of DICTs, combined with tailored pedagogical activities according to the reality of students access to technology, aided in the development of socio-emotional skills, since, during virtual classes, positive impacts were recognized in the sense of organization both in the group dynamics in which students demonstrated empathy and collaboration with colleagues who had difficulties in using the DICTs, as well as in individual activities.",2025.0,,0,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000340bbbf3d8e2d133738a68133aa723b655d45

We measured the psychological status of BC patients and female nurses and compared the severity within the two groups at the peak time-point of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A total of 207 BC patients and 684 female nurses were recruited from Wuhan. They completed an anonymous questionnaire online using the most popular social media software in China, WeChat. The psychological status of BC patients and of female nurses was measured using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for evaluation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The differences between the two groups were analyzed. Results: The scores of BC patients and frontline female nurses for the four scales were significantly higher than those of non-frontline female nurses (P < 0.001). There were similar scores between BC patients and frontline female nurses for PHQ-9, GAD-7, and IES-R (P = 0.789, P = 0.101, P = 0.158, respectively). Notably, the scores of BC patients for ISI were significantly higher than those of the frontline female nurses (P = 0.016). A considerable proportion of BC patients reported symptoms of depression (106/207, 51.2%), anxiety (130/207, 62.8%), insomnia (106/207, 51.2%), and PTSD (73/207, 35.5%), which was more severe than that of female nurses. Conclusions: BC patients experienced great psychological pressure during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incidents of symptomatic anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and PTSD were significantly comparable to that of frontline female nurses, and episodes of insomnia among BC participants were more serious than for frontline female nurses.",2020.0,2020-12-15,34,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00035ac98d8bc38fbca02a1cc957f55141af67c0

We conducted the multigroup structural equation modelling with the diagonally weighted least squares estimation method as the variables are categorical. Lastly, we performed ANOVA to spot if there is a change in the drivers of passenger satisfaction between before and after the pandemic. The results suggest all service attributes have a significant impact on satisfaction in the pre-COVID-19 era. Even if it seems that in-flight entertainment and in-flight WiFi are not as influential as before in the post-pandemic, ANOVA results revealed the difference between the pre-pandemic and the new-normal period was not statistically significant. Accordingly, airlines should not ignore the need to improve service attributes, called premium services, and holistically improve service design. In addition, after value for money, the most important attribute for passengers is ground handling. Hence, speeding up the boarding process would return carriers in the form of more satisfied customers.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthodontic appointments, and the concerns and anxiety levels of orthodontic patients in Iran.


METHODS
An anonymous 40-question questionnaire was sent online to the patients of private orthodontic clinics in 2 cities of Birjand, and Mashhad, capitals of Eastern provinces of Iran. Orthodontic patients of Mashhad dental school received the questionnaire as well. Descriptive statistics were reported, and the association between gender, oral health literacy (OHL), and adherence to orthodontic appointments and attendance, along with data on feeling, concern, and level of anxiety regarding quarantine/coronavirus pandemic were evaluated using the chi-square analysis.


RESULTS
Three hundred twenty-four patients, with a mean age of 32.43 years, answered the questionnaire. Fifty-seven percent of participants said that they only left home for their daily requirements. Seventy-two percent of the participants reported feeling calm about the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Most of the patients (74%) said that they would attend their orthodontic appointment in case of urgency, and 41% of patients declared that their greatest concern was the probability of a delay in completion of treatment. Forty-five percent of patients had adequate OHL. There was a significant association between OHL and willingness to attend orthodontic treatment, concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic on orthodontic treatment, and the frequency of daily teeth brushing.


CONCLUSION
Women respected the quarantine more than men. Patients with higher OHL were more willing to attend their appointments, but only in case of an emergency, due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Women were more concerned and had better oral hygiene behaviors.",2021.0,2021-06-01,5,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004010576c78c3b517ef526643e898f859a2dc1

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a marked reduction in in-patient attendance. We are highlighting the impact of lockdown in neurotrauma cases in our institution compared to the prelockdown period. Methods We have done the retrospective review of the patients admitted due to TBI in prelockdown (January 14–March 21, 2020) and lockdown period (March 25–May 31, 2020) for the same duration of the 68 days at our tertiary institution. We have included demographic characteristics (age, sex), mode of injury, the severity of TBI, radiological diagnosis (computed tomography scan), and treatment obtained in our study. We compared the data for percentage (%) reduction of TBI cases and factors responsible for it during the lockdown period. Result A total of 166 patients were included in both groups. TBI’s most common mechanism was road traffic accident, but we observed an increase in self-fall (16.9% vs. 38.1%) and assault (11.2% vs. 19%) during the lockdown period. We have noted that moderate TBI increased during the lockdown period by 17%. Overall, there is a reduction of 67% in TBI cases during the lockdown period. Conclusion The COVID pandemic has limited road traffic activity, and strict implementation of lockdown has restricted the infection and has reduced the neurotrauma emergencies. Simultaneously, moderate TBI cases have increased because of the lack of transportation facility and delay in the management of mild TBI cases.",2021.0,2021-04-15,2,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00043ebdf59fbe88328078e9f7895cfa12a14887

A search was conducted in three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus), using terms specific to COVID-19 and oral lesions, including only primary studies. Study selection was undertaken by two reviewers independently. A descriptive analysis was performed. Results: The results included 55 studies in the data synthesis analysis. Most of the studies were case reports and case series. Some of the studies did not relate a biological test to confirm COVID-19. The ulcer lesion and that clinical examination by specialists were the most reported lesion in case reports and case series studies, while taste alterations and patient self-report were more reported in observational studies. Conclusions: This review concluded that the oral lesions in patients with COVID-19 differ according to the study design. The lack of high-quality scientific evidence in the dental literature on COVID-19 makes the findings inconsistent by the lack of sample selection criteria, diagnostic criteria and classification of oral lesions.",2024.0,2024-06-10,0,74,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00047175b0f23fd30fb539e599ec79c4650ca178

10.5694/mja2.51750,Medications for early treatment of COVID‐19 in Australia,"Early treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infections can prevent hospitalisation and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) who have one or more risk factors for serious COVID‐19 progression. While early treatment presents a range of logistical challenges, clinicians are nevertheless aided by a growing number of approved medications for early treatment of COVID‐19. Medications include drugs that inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 viral replication, anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 monoclonal antibody formulations that provide passive immunisation, and immunomodulatory drugs that suppress the body’s inflammatory response. Several drugs with different modes of action are approved in Australia for early treatment of COVID‐19, including nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir, molnupiravir, and monoclonal antibody formulations. Although these drugs are recommended, clinicians are encouraged to remain up to date on current indications, contraindications and the clinical efficacy of these drugs against SARS‐CoV‐2 variants currently circulating in communities. Other treatments, including hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and dietary supplements, have been popularised but are not recommended for early treatment of COVID‐19. As new drugs and new data on use of existing approved drugs become available, clinicians face a growing challenge in determining the optimal treatments from the array of options. As it stands, early treatment of COVID‐19 needs to be individualised depending on age, pregnancy status, existing medications, and renal and liver disease status. Future treatments in development might have roles in patients with lower risk profiles and in reducing transmission as we learn to live with SARS‐CoV‐2.",2022.0,2022-10-23,1,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004b13e00b65e22aee125af82ecda1f529853d2

Indiscriminate COVID-19 vaccination has been extended to include age groups and naturally immune people with minimal danger of suffering serious complications due to COVID-19. Solid immuno-histopathological evidence demonstrates that the COVID-19 genetic vaccines can display a wide distribution within the body, affecting tissues that are terminally differentiated and far away from the injection site. These include the heart and brain, which may incur in situ production of spike protein eliciting a strong autoimmunological inflammatory response. Due to the fact that every human cell which synthesises non-self antigens, inevitably becomes the target of the immune system, and since the human body is not a strictly compartmentalised system, accurate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are needed in order to determine precisely which tissues can be harmed. Therefore, our article aims to draw the attention of the scientific and regulatory communities to the critical need for biodistribution studies for the genetic vaccines against COVID-19, as well as for rational harm-benefit assessments by age group.",2023.0,2023-09-14,8,82,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004d5f4d1fc2cd60d299494f1f97384e4614019

Given that healthcare professionals’ recommendations significantly influence people’s vaccination decisions, this study aimed to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of healthcare professionals working in family health centers towards COVID-19 vaccines. Methods Questionnaires for this descriptive cross-sectional study were administered between February and April 2022. The population comprised 408 health workers employed in family health centers in Malatya, with 292 individuals completing the study. The questionnaire included questions about sociodemographic, COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines and the COVID-19 Fear Scale. Results Although 97.3% of the research group reported having received the COVID-19 vaccination, 47.9% expressed concerns about these vaccines. The median score of the COVID-19 Fear Scale was 15 (7.00-35.00). 86.6% of the participants indicated that they recommended COVID-19 vaccines. 16.4% of the participants agreed with the statement ‘there are no studies proving the safety of vaccines,’ and 49% agreed that ‘vaccines pass through clinical trials quickly and are put on the market’. Those who did not recommend COVID-19 vaccines, those who agreed with the statement ‘there are no studies proving the safety of vaccines’ and those who agreed with the statement ‘vaccines pass through clinical trials quickly and are put on the market’ were concerned about COVID-19 vaccines with their level of concern significantly higher (p < 0.05). Conclusions Almost all members of the research group had received the COVID-19 vaccine, yet almost half of them expressed concerns about vaccines. Those who do not recommend vaccines, those who believe they are released quickly, and those who have safety concerns are more likely to be concerned. Key messages • Identify the reasons for health workers’ concerns about vaccines and provide remedial interventions for concerns that may arise regarding other vaccines. • It should be ensured that healthcare professionals, who are expected to be role models for society in terms of immunization, possess scientific and up-to-date knowledge on vaccines.",2024.0,2024-10-28,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004da992c00a544654cc6fb496a7fb3f8ac1a07

10.52877/instabright.04.01.0109,Learning Activities for Modular Distance Learning in Dr. Francisco L. Calingasan Memorial Colleges Foundation Inc. Tuy and Nasugbu Campuses,"In the era of globalization and internationalization, the school is at the forefront of meeting the challenges of the 21st century education. Innovations abound, millions of information are made available in the worldwide web and new ways of management practices and learning have emerged (Dayagbil, 2016). Distance learning is a learning delivery modality which occurs when the teacher and learners are geographically remote from each other. Modular Distance Learning (MDL) is a type of distance learning that uses modules to transfer learning to the students. (Llego, 2020). The education system has immensely transformed from traditional way of learning into a more diverse one which can cope with the fast-changing   world.   It   can now address the different skills of the 21st century learners. The integration of different learning modalities into the curriculum makes it more accessible for everyone. In the Philippines, the Department of Education widens learners’ access to quality education through the Alternative Delivery Mode. Based on Republic Act 10618 or an Act Establishing Rural Farm Schools as Alternative Delivery Mode of Secondary Education and Appropriating Funds of 2013, the Alternative Delivery Mode may include the use of facilitator - aided and interactive self - instructional print and audio - based learning materials, video tapes, face - to - face structured learning groups, demonstration sessions, home visits, mentoring and remediation. This implies that aside from the formal education in which students are confined in the classrooms, there are ways to reach out to learners especially if they are incapable of attending regular class days. To further address the accessibility of education for the Filipino learners, the Philippines reaffirmed its global commitment to bring benefits of education to “every citizen to every society” and developed the National Plan of Action to Achieve Education for All which also aimed to achieve an improved quality of basic education for every Filipino. It includes reforms in the   curriculum   and introduced the Alternative Delivery Modes that promote access   and   holding   power   of   school through the implementation of the Project EASE (Effective Alternative Secondary Education) to complement the existing formal education to make secondary education more accessible to students in disadvantaged situations. Learning is facilitated through the use of modules as instructional materials during the period when students are out of the classroom. Truly, the Philippine government together with the Department of Education continuously strive to provide and improve the quality of education for every Filipino to meet the demands of the global community. Even during these trying times as we face the COVID-19 pandemic, the department yield ways to adapt to the new normal by launching various distance learning modalities for the school year 2020-2021. This is to ensure that the pandemic will not hinder learning but also to secure the health of every stakeholder in the learning process. Based on the survey results from the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forms distributed by the schools nationwide, both private and public, the parents as well as the learners’ preferred modular distance learning than online distance learning. The 8.8 million parents opted for modular learning while   only   3.8 million chose online learning. On the other hand, 7.2 million enrolees preferred modular distance learning while only 2 million enrolees opted for online distance learning. (Malipol, 2020). It is for this that this study was thought of. It attempts to assess the utilization of Modular Distance Learning Strategies of Teachers in Dr. Francisco L.

MAFLD, affecting a quarter of the global population, emerges as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. This study focuses on the clinical significance of Paxlovid, the first orally bioavailable antiviral agent granted Emergency Use Authorization in the United States. Notably, outcomes from phase II/III trials exhibit an 88% relative risk reduction in COVID-19-associated hospitalization or mortality among high-risk patients. Despite conflicting data on the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity, this research strives to bridge the gap by evaluating the effectiveness of Paxlovid in MAFLD patients with COVID-19, addressing the scarcity of relevant studies.",2024.0,2024-01-01,3,70,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005bf10033599ffbfd30710661097f7d9e3ebe5

A total of 811 participants (52% females) from 13 districts in Wuhan were invited to complete surveys regarding demographics, psychosocial factors and compliance with epidemic prevention guidelines. Individual-level characteristics were combined with district-level measures to create multilevel predictive models of compliance with prevention guidelines, and used the Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) to analyze the data. Findings revealed that there were significant differences in the compliance of citizens from 13 districts of Wuhan (F = 5.65, P < 0.001). Hierarchical linear model analysis revealed that the risk factors case growth rate, COVID-19-related perceived stress, anxiety, significantly negatively predicted compliance. Hope and conscientiousness significantly positively predicted compliance with prevention guidelines, and the negative predictive effect of anxiety disappeared. Overall, we found significant differences in compliance with prevention guidelines among different districts. Risk factors at the individual level have had a negative impact on individuals’ compliance with prevention guidelines, but this impact can be mitigated by the positive role of personal protective factors such as conscientiousness and hope.",2022.0,2022-03-23,0,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005fd8c42aa154fb6ac2e4ccb2331630ce49b4c
10.1183/13993003.02302-2023,A proposed approach to pulmonary long COVID: a viewpoint,"Extract Long COVID (also known as “post-acute sequelae of COVID-19”) is a multi-system disorder that follows an acute bout of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection [1]. Although its exact prevalence is unknown, it is estimated to affect approximately 10% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, though in reality the proportion is likely much higher owing to under-reporting of cases [1]. The prevalence is elevated in patients who have had acute SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, and lower in those who have been previously vaccinated or were infected with the Omicron variant [1]. In approximately 6% of the cases of long COVID, pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and wheeziness are prominent, leading to considerable disability and morbidity [2, 3]. While it is attractive to view long COVID as one disease, it is likely a very complex, heterogeneous disorder, with multiple different phenotypes, each driven by a unique set of molecules and pathways [1]. Even within an organ system (e.g. the lungs), there is likely to be significant heterogeneity in the phenotypes of disease. Here, we hypothesise that patients with long COVID with a predominance of pulmonary symptoms (which we will refer to in this viewpoint editorial as “pulmonary long COVID”, or PLC) have airway pathology that can be detected using conventional as well as emerging technologies, and careful phenotyping of this condition will provide important insights on its mechanism(s) and reveal novel biomarkers and therapeutic solutions for millions around the world with PLC.",2024.0,2024-03-07,2,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00060d701eb5a3db4e6058fae21e117ee116aea3

10.1002/eji.202149656,SARS‐CoV‐2 infection activates dendritic cells via cytosolic receptors rather than extracellular TLRs,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), an infectious disease characterized by strong induction of inflammatory cytokines, progressive lung inflammation, and potentially multiorgan dysfunction. It remains unclear how SARS‐CoV‐2 infection leads to immune activation. The Spike (S) protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 has been suggested to trigger TLR4 and thereby activate immunity. Here, we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus nor primary SARS‐CoV‐2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4‐expressing cell line. Human monocyte‐derived DCs express TLR4 but not angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and DCs were not infected by SARS‐CoV‐2. Notably, neither S protein nor SARS‐CoV‐2 induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating that both S protein and SARS‐CoV‐2 virus particles do not trigger extracellular TLRs including TLR4. Ectopic expression of ACE2 in DCs led to efficient infection by SARS‐CoV‐2 and, strikingly, efficient type I IFN and cytokine responses. These data strongly suggest that not extracellular TLRs but intracellular viral sensors are key players in sensing SARS‐CoV‐2. These data imply that SARS‐CoV‐2 escapes direct sensing by TLRs, which might underlie the lack of efficient immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 early during infection.",2022.0,2022-01-31,6,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00062e745299473bba53c0e8fa65c5b5e1962417

Review of mass media and publications from six countries","ABSTRACT During the Covid-19 pandemic, rich countries employed lockdown and physical distancing policies for transmission control. However, the question still remains whether these measures are also suitable in countries with a fragile economy, which rests mainly on the informal sector. The impacts of lockdown measures in disadvantaged population strata in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) were reviewed using i) 93 media reports and ii) 17 published scientific papers. This review showed that those who suffered the most from the lockdown were migrants, workers in the large informal sector, small businesses, slum dwellers, women and elderly, revealing the social, cultural and economic inequalities of societies. Financial and food support for the poor was inadequate and sometimes mismanaged. In the better organized societies, the resilience was stronger (South Korea, Kerala/India) but here also the poor had to suffer the most.

Covid-19, with its high numbers of quickly deteriorating patients requiring intensive care, has acutely demonstrated how helpful it would be for clinicians to have reliable, readily available, up-to-date information at hand to be able to act in accordance with what the individual patient would have wanted. Yet for the past few decades advance directives have fallen short of their potential, for various reasons. At worst, advance directives are perceived as unwieldy legal documents that put excessive demands on patients without providing useful guidance for better care. Recent efforts such as advance care planning have tried to remedy some of these shortcomings but have so far met with limited success.

10.1101/2020.07.13.20144907,The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) systematically underestimates the risk of in-hospital mortality in unplanned COVID-19 admissions to hospital.,"Background: Although the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and its latest version NEWS2 are recommended for monitoring for deterioration in patients admitted to hospital, little is known about their performance in COVID-19 patients. We analysed the performance of National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Adult non-elective admissions discharged between 11-March-2020 to 13-June-2020 with an index NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours of admission are used to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24hours, 48hours, and 72hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions. Results: Out of 6480 non-elective admissions, 620 (9.6%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. They were older (73.3 vs 67.7yrs), more often male (54.7% vs 50.1%), had higher index NEWS (4 vs 2.5) and NEWS2 (4.6 vs 2.8) scores and higher in-hospital mortality (32.1% vs 5.8%). The c-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 admissions was significantly lower using NEWS (0.64 vs 0.74) or NEWS2 (0.64 vs 0.74), however these differences reduced at 72hours (NEWS: 0.75 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.71 vs 0.81), 48 hours (NEWS: 0.78 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.76 vs 0.82) and 24hours (NEWS: 0.84 vs 0.84; NEWS2: 0.86 vs 0.84). Increasing NEWS2 values reflected increased mortality, but for any given value the absolute risk was on average 24% higher (e.g.NEWS2=5: 36% vs 9%). Interpretation: NEWS2 is a valid predictor of the mortality risk but substantially underestimates the absolute mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

Through a social-ecological model, this study attempts to comprehensively examine the multilevel factors associated with COVID-19 preventive practices in South Korea. Accordingly, a web survey involving 1,500 participants was conducted in December 2020. An ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to examine the multilevel factors (individual, interpersonal, community, and policy levels) related to COVID-19 preventive measures, which are based on wearing a mask, washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing, and social distancing. When factors at each level were investigated, higher scores of COVID-19 fear and correct knowledge at the individual level, COVID-19 information share at the interpersonal level, and better evaluation of the national government policies in regard to COVID-19 at the policy level were positively associated with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Community-level factors—neighborhood perception and community participation—were negatively significantly related to COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Additionally, older age, being female, and having a graduate-level education were positively related to better preventive behaviors. The findings of the current study suggest that multilevel efforts are needed to promote preventive behaviors. Specifically, more effort to alleviate COVID-19-related fear and disseminate correct knowledge among Korean citizens is needed as the individual-level characteristics explained the preventive behaviors more than the factors at upper levels.",2022.0,2022-03-31,24,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000710f5df770eb8aa3a0ac83022f3376a76aa0f

However, available data might be interpreted with caution because of differences in the national health systems, local implementation issues, and adherence limitations to guidelines. A comprehensive description of infection, exposure at work, and biosafety habits during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been conducted among the HCW groups in Latin American populations. Objective To describe SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, infections, and extent of PPE use during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs at three different times, including dental practitioners (DP), nursing assistants (NA), physicians (P), and respiratory therapists (RT), from Bogotá, Colombia. Methods: After IRB approval, this cross-sectional study included 307 HCWs. Participants provided nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples to detect viral RNA (RT-qPCR) and IgM/IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 (ELFA-ELISA) at baseline (BL) and two follow-ups. Infection prevalence was defined as the number of positive-tested participants (RT-qPCR and/or IgM). Data on clinical status and biosafety habits were collected each time. Results Differential infection prevalence was found among HCWs through the study timeline (BL: RT-qPCR = 2.6%, IgM = 1.6%; follow-up 1 (45 days after BL): RT-qPCR = 4.5%, IgM = 3.9%; follow-up 2 (60 days after BL): RT-qPCR = 3.58%, IgM = 1.3%. Dental practitioners showed a higher infection frequency in BL and follow-up 1. IgG-positive tested HCWs percentage progressively increased from BL to follow-ups among the whole sample while index values decreased. Limitations in N95 availability and a high perception of occupational risk were reported. Conclusion A low prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs groups was found. Over time, there was an increase in participants showing IgG antibodies, although the levels of these antibodies in the blood decreased. Additionally, HCWs reported limitations in the availability of PPE as well as a variation in their safety practices.",2023.0,2023-10-10,0,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000758e825c2c227dd72214f2f8ac4f845811884

10.3389/fmolb.2022.1004036,Cytoplasmic tail determines the membrane trafficking and localization of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates viral entry through associating with ACE2 on host cells. Intracellular trafficking and palmitoylation of S protein are required for its function. The short cytoplasmic tail of S protein plays a key role in the intracellular trafficking, which contains the binding site for the host trafficking proteins such as COPI, COPII and SNX27. This cytoplasmic tail also contains the palmitoylation sites of S protein. Protein palmitoylation modification of S protein could be catalyzed by a family of zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein palmitoyltransferases (ZDHHCs). The intracellular trafficking and membrane location facilitate surface expression of S protein and assembly of progeny virions. In this review, we summarize the function of S protein cytoplasmic tail in transportation and localization. S protein relies on intracellular trafficking pathways and palmitoylation modification to facilitate the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, meanwhile it could interfere with the host transport pathways. The interplay between S protein and intracellular trafficking proteins could partially explain the acute symptoms or Long-COVID complications in multiple organs of COVID-19 patients.",2022.0,2022-09-26,9,41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0007c3fc4d13f73fc95cd976c9ae35ce952af190
10.2196/44607,"A Computational Platform to Support the Detection, Follow-up, and Epidemiological Surveillance of Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders: Protocol for a Development and Evaluation Study","Background According to the World Health Organization, approximately 15% of the global population is affected by mental health or substance use disorders. These conditions contribute significantly to the global disease burden, which has worsened because of the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19. In Mexico, a quarter of the population between the ages of 18 and 65 years who reside in urban areas present a mental health condition. The presence of a mental or substance abuse disorder is behind a significant percentage of suicidal behaviors in Mexico, where only 1 in 5 of those who have these disorders receive any treatment. Objective This study aims to develop, deploy, and evaluate a computational platform to support the early detection and intervention of mental and substance use disorders in secondary and high schools as well as primary care units. The platform also aims to facilitate monitoring, treatment, and epidemiological surveillance ultimately helping specialized health units at the secondary level of care. Methods The development and evaluation of the proposed computational platform will run during 3 stages. In stage 1, the identification of the functional and user requirements and the implementation of the modules to support the screening, follow-up, treatment, and epidemiological surveillance will be performed. In stage 2, the initial deployment of the screening module will be carried out in a set of secondary and high schools, as well as the deployment of the modules to support the follow-up, treatment, and epidemiological surveillance processes in primary and secondary care health units. In parallel, during stage 2, patient applications to support early interventions and continuous monitoring will also be developed. Finally, during stage 3, the deployment of the complete platform will be performed jointly with a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Results The screening process has started, and 6 schools have been currently enrolled. As of February 2023, a total of 1501 students have undergone screening, and the referral of those students presenting a risk in mental health or substance use to primary care units has also started. The development, deployment, and evaluation of all the modules of the proposed platform are expected to be completed by late 2024. Conclusions The expected results of this study are to impact a better integration between the different levels of health care, from early detection to follow-up and epidemiological surveillance of mental and substance use disorders contributing to reducing the gap in the attention to these problems in the community.

10.1093/ije/dyaa198,A demographic scaling model for estimating the total number of COVID-19 infections,"Background: The total number of COVID-19 infections is critical information for decision makers when assessing the progress of the pandemic, its implications, and policy options. Despite efforts to carefully monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported number of confirmed cases is likely to underestimate the actual number of infections. We aim to estimate the total number of COVID-19 infections in a straightforward manner using a demographic scaling approach based on life tables. Methods: We use data on total number of COVID-19 attributable deaths, population counts, and life tables as well as information on infection fatality rates as reported in Verity et al. (2020) for Hubei, China. We develop a scaling approach based on life tables and remaining life expectancy to map infection fatality rates between two countries to account for differences in their age structure, health status, and the health care system. The scaled infection fatality rates can be used in combination with COVID-19 attributable deaths to calculate estimates of the total number of infected. We also introduce easy to apply formulas to quantify the bias that would be required in death counts and infection fatality rates in order to reproduce a certain estimate of infections. Findings: Across the 10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of April 17, 2020, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 4 times the number of confirmed cases. The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval suggests on average twice as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound 10 times as many. Country-specific variation is high. For Italy, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 1 million, or almost 6 times the number of confirmed cases. For the U.S., our estimate of 1.4 million is close to being twice as large as the number of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of 3 million is more than 4 times the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive, we estimate that the total number of infected is only 1.2 times (upper bound: 3 times) than the number of confirmed cases. Comparing our results with findings from local seroprevalence studies and applying our bias formulas shows that some of their infection estimates would only be possible if just a small fraction of COVID-19 related deaths were recorded, indicating that these seroprevalence estimates might not be representative for the total population. Interpretation: As many countries lack population based seroprevalence studies, straightforward demographic adjustment can be used to deliver useful estimates of the total number of infected cases. Our results imply that the total number COVID-19 cases may be approximately 4 times (95%: 2 to 10 times) that of the confirmed cases. Although these estimates are uncertain and vary across countries, they indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is much more broadly spread than what confirmed cases would suggest, and the number of asymptomatic cases or cases with mild symptoms may be high. In cases in which estimates from local seroprevalence studies or from simulation models exist, our approach can provide a simple benchmark to assess the quality of those estimates.",2020.0,2020-04-24,36,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00086620192e099aa9597f55b9d39d3052170940

The pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has a high sequence and architecture identity with SARS-CoV, but far more people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here, combining structural data from cryo-EM and structure prediction, we constructed bottom-up Martini coarse-grained models of intact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations were performed, allowing us to explore their dynamics and supramolecular organization. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes present a spherical morphology with structural proteins forming multiple string-like islands in the membrane and clusters between heads of spike proteins.

10.1002/ctm2.1026,Promising use of immune cell‐derived exosomes in the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection is persistently threatening the lives of thousands of individuals globally. It triggers pulmonary oedema, driving to dyspnoea and lung failure. Viral infectivity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a genuine challenge due to the mutagenic genome and mysterious immune‐pathophysiology. Early reports highlighted that extracellular vesicles (exosomes, Exos) work to enhance COVID‐19 progression by mediating viral transmission, replication and mutations. Furthermore, recent studies revealed that Exos derived from immune cells play an essential role in the promotion of immune cell exhaustion by transferring regulatory lncRNAs and miRNAs from exhausted cells to the active cells. Fortunately, there are great chances to modulate the immune functions of Exos towards a sustained repression of COVID‐19. Engineered Exos hold promising immunotherapeutic opportunities for remodelling cytotoxic T cells’ function. Immune cell‐derived Exos may trigger a stable epigenetic repression of viral infectivity, restore functional cytokine‐producing T cells and rebalance immune response in severe infections by inducing functional T regulatory cells (Tregs). This review introduces a view on the current outcomes of immunopathology, and immunotherapeutic applications of immune cell‐derived Exos in COVID‐19, besides new perspectives to develop novel patterns of engineered Exos triggering novel anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 immune responses.",2022.0,2022-08-01,7,90,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00089a9553d896fb5b661d88028ba1c0124f7cdf

10.1177/20503121241261165,COVID-19 vaccine-associated vasculitis: A systematic review,"Objectives: Post-COVID-19 vaccine-associated vasculitis stands as one of the most serious side effects attributed to COVID-19 vaccines. This complication encompasses diverse manifestations which vary in presentation and severity. Moreover, it can impact patients across all age groups, with a notably elevated incidence in the elderly. This systematic review seeks to review and evaluate the spectrum of vasculitis manifestations linked to COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was done by searching through PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus up to October 2022. Articles including data about sex, age at diagnosis, vasculitis clinical manifestations, type of vaccination, most commonly used investigations, comorbid medical conditions, treatments, and clinical outcomes were included in the final analysis. Furthermore, vasculitis flare-ups post-vaccination were considered part of this review. Results: A total number of 117 studies describing 158 patients developing vasculitis following COVID-19 vaccination were included in the final analysis. Among the patients who developed vasculitis, the most administered type of vaccination was the mRNA vaccine subtype (n = 103), followed by the viral vector vaccines (n = 42) and inactivated viral vaccines (n = 10). On the other hand, about 38% of vasculitis-related symptoms occurred after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine and 37% occurred after taking the second dose. The skin (60.7%) and the kidneys (27.8%) were the most affected organs and complete remission was achieved in 111 patients (70%), while partial remission occurred in 11% of the patient population. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccine-induced vasculitis is a rare occurrence associated with COVID-19 vaccines. It generally presents a favorable prognosis and outcomes for the vast majority of patients, ultimately leading to full remission within days.

Some cardiac defects may be associated with a poor COVID-19 outcome. Risk estimation in ACHD is currently based on expert opinion. The aim of this study was to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors for a complicated course of COVID-19 in patients with ACHD. Methods Twenty-five ACHD centres in nine European countries participated in the study. Consecutive patients with ACHD diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting to one of the participating centres between 27 March and 6 June 2020 were included. A complicated disease course was defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation and/or inotropic support, or a fatal outcome. Results Of 105 patients with a mean age of 38±13 years (58% women), 13 had a complicated disease course, of whom 5 died. In univariable analysis, age (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, per 5 years), ≥2 comorbidities (OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 24.5), body mass index of >25 kg/m2 (OR 7.2, 95% CI 1.9 to 28.3) and cyanotic heart disease (OR 13.2, 95% CI 2.5 to 68.4) were associated with a complicated disease course. In a multivariable logistic regression model, cyanotic heart disease was the most important predictor (OR 60.0, 95% CI 7.6 to 474.0). Conclusions Among patients with ACHD, general risk factors (age, obesity and multiple comorbidities) are associated with an increased risk of complicated COVID-19 course.

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) allows specific imaging of the iodinated contrast agent distribution within the lung, which has been demonstrated as a surrogate marker of lung perfusion [5, 6]. Therefore, our goal was to assess in vivo pulmonary microvascular involvement in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia by using DECT and to determine whether vascular changes vary during the course of the disease. In COVID-19 pneumonia, dual-energy computed tomography has shown two patterns of lung perfusion along the course of the disease: an increase in perfusion blood volume (PBV) with ground-glass opacities and a decrease in PBV with consolidation https://bit.ly/2Zh0XcI",2020.0,2020-09-17,35,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00091293a20b0d97fa7db9d1fcdd9d62ffe824d3

The disease of COVID-19 significantly affected the development of aggregate public finances, which was confirmed especially in 2020. In 2020, the area of the magic triangles decreased significantly from 44.8% (Hungary) to 60.2% (Poland). In 2021, all V4 countries will see an improvement in financial indicators and, at the same time, an increase in the area of the magic triangles of public finances, which signals the progress of the public finances situation.",2022.0,2022-09-01,0,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00092f81d5c7dc011709092a23e64b9d9759d576

However, the public measures that are implemented are insufficient to guarantee employees a good work–life balance, and organisations have understood that planning through ‘corporate family responsibility’ schemes can lead to several economic benefits. Thus, considering the needs of individuals and the challenges imposed by society and by the COVID-19 pandemic, the article constitutes an exploratory study that presents two case studies of organisational welfare in Italy to reflect upon the efficacy of corporate family responsibility activities.

The core components of the IPPI that should not be modified include that staff approach one-to-one resident interactions with a positive intent, use good communication skills, and base interactions on a preferred activity of the resident living with dementia. We sought to understand what was modified and motivations behind the modifications from implementation champions. We utilized the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications to Evidence-Based Implementation Strategies (FRAME-IS) to track and characterize modifications using data from a total of n=78 interviews with n=23 NH provider champions who were implementing the IPPI in their community as part of a quality improvement project. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded via the FRAME-IS in Dedoose. Over half of champions (61%; n=14) reported unplanned, fidelity-consistent modifications to IPPI content (e.g., loosening structure) or implementation context (e.g., setting). Motivation ranged from organizational (e.g., time constraints) to recipient (e.g., cognitive capacity), with many citing resident preferences. Modifications are a necessary aspect of evidence-based implementation efforts and should be embraced by implementation researchers. Many champions in the present study reported creative modifications previously unexplored by the IPPI research team. Available resources, COVID-19 regulations, and resident preferences can highly impact implementation efforts in the NH setting. Future implementation efforts should build flexibility into intervention protocols and welcome the influence of recipient preferences in order to reach a wider range of users and achieve greater satisfaction.",2024.0,2024-12-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0009d2fc0fd0c2527edc43e38c8b11e62b2322ad
10.1371/journal.pone.0286700,"Relationships between the COVID-19 lockdown, socioeconomic factors and acute coronary syndrome hospitalisations in France","Introduction Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an overall drop in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) hospitalizations. Additionally, there is a well-known association between ACS and socioeconomic status. This study aims to assess the COVID-19 effect on ACS admissions in France during the first national lockdown and investigate the factors associated with its spatial heterogeneity. Materials and methods In this retrospective study, we used the French hospital discharge database (PMSI) to estimate ACS admission rates in all public and private hospitals in 2019 and 2020. A negative binomial regression explored the nationwide change in ACS admissions during lockdown compared with 2019. A multivariate analysis explored the factors associated with the ACS admission incidence rate ratio (IRR, 2020 incidence rate/2019 incidence rate) variation at the county level. Results We found a significant but geographically heterogeneous nationwide reduction in ACS admissions during lockdown (IRR 0·70 [0·64–0·76]). After adjustment for cumulative COVID-19 admissions and the ageing index, a higher share of people on short-term working arrangements during lockdown at the county level was associated with a lower IRR, while a higher share of individuals with a high school degree and a higher density of acute care beds were associated with a higher ratio. Conclusions During the first national lockdown, there was an overall decrease in ACS admissions. Local provision of inpatient care and socioeconomic determinants linked to occupation were independently associated with the variation in hospitalizations.",2023.0,2023-06-07,0,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0009e2dd18793599460e4da23a50b05955cbfec0

We investigated the factors affecting low-rescue suicide attempts using the risk-rescue rating scale (RRRS) among patients who visited the emergency department (ED) after attempting suicide before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrospectively investigated suicide attempts made by patients who visited our ED from March 2019 to September 2020. Patients were classified into two groups based on whether they attempted suicide before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on demographic variables, psychiatric factors, suicide risk factors and rescue factors were collected and compared. Results A total of 518 patients were included in the study, 275 (53.1%) of whom attempted suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of patients who made low-rescue suicide attempts differed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (37.1% vs. 28.8%) (P = 0.046). However, the proportions of patients who made high-risk suicide attempts and high-lethality suicide attempts did not significantly differ between the two periods. The independent risk factors for low-rescue suicide attempts were age and the COVID-19 pandemic (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.03; P = 0.006) (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03–2.25; P = 0.034). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with low-rescue suicide attempts in patients visiting the ED after attempting suicide. Thus, we need to consider the implementation of measures to prevent low-rescue suicide attempts during similar infectious disease crises.",2021.0,2021-08-19,10,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0009eba2c8b1eba090d148f9d3e60de7fc9a8336

Method This is a quasi-experimental study. Fourteen participants were enrolled in the multicomponent exercise program Vivifrail® for 12 weeks, 5 days a week, with weekly video calls for assessment of acceptability and adequacy. The acceptability and adequacy questionnaire was based on 6 barriers that older adults face when engaging in physical exercise. Responses were measured using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4 points, with a maximum score of 24 points (maximum acceptability). Results Fourteen participants (89.07±6.30 years) concluded the protocol, with an acceptability rate of 70%. Internal consistency was moderate, with a Cronbach’s coefficient alpha of 0.7. Participants showed an overall increase in acceptability and adequacy (from 17.8±3.51 points in the first week to 22.0±2.94 in the 12th week). Four participants (28.6%) required some modification to the exercise protocol. Conclusion The Vivifrail® protocol, together with weekly follow-up via videoconferencing, was well accepted and adequate. It could be an important tool for promoting quality of life, especially in the oldest-old with difficulty leaving home. The acceptability questionnaire was able to detect exercise barriers and suggest possible modifications to the training program and could be presented as a suggestion for the evaluation of intervention protocols in the oldest-old population. Therefore, the Vivifrail® protocol, with weekly follow-up via videoconferencing, could be a new field of intervention for health professionals.",2024.0,,1,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a81ba712a5485e52cbaa7bd77a196a07be48a

10.3390/tropicalmed7070132,False Positivity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Patients with Acute Tropical Diseases in Thailand,"Serology remains a useful indirect method of diagnosing tropical diseases, especially in dengue infection. However, the current literature regarding cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and dengue serology is limited and revealed conflicting results. As a means to uncover relevant serological insight involving antibody classes against SARS-CoV-2 and cross-reactivity, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgM, and IgG ELISA, based on spike and nucleocapsid proteins, were selected for a fever-presenting tropical disease patient investigation. The study was conducted at the Faculty of Tropical Medicine during March to December 2021. The study data source comprised (i) 170 non-COVID-19 sera from 140 adults and children presenting with acute undifferentiated febrile illness and 30 healthy volunteers, and (ii) 31 COVID-19 sera from 17 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Among 170 non-COVID-19 samples, 27 were false positives (15.9%), of which IgA, IgM, and IgG cross-reactive antibody classes were detected in 18 (10.6%), 9 (5.3%), and 3 (1.8%) cases, respectively. Interestingly, one case exhibited both IgA and IgM false positivity, while two cases exhibited both IgA and IgG false positivity. The false positivity rate in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgM was reported in adults with dengue infection (11.3% and 5%) and adults with other tropical diseases (16.7% and 13.3%). The urea dissociation method applied to mitigate false positivity resulted in significantly decreased ELISA-based false and true positives. In conclusion, the analysis of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in sera of patients with different tropical diseases showed that high IgA and IgM false positivity thus potentially limits serological assay utility in fever-presenting patients in tropical areas.",2022.0,2022-07-01,10,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000ae29a57a01d6a474f6068d2927d9c40309200

A 12-year-old boy with HbSC disease alpha-thalassemia trait presented to a pediatric emergency room with fever and weakness. His vital signs were notable for fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. His physical exam was concerning for increased work of breathing. He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by PCR although his hemoglobin level remained near his baseline. His chest radiograph showed a retrocardiac opacity concerning for evolving acute chest syndrome. He decompensated quickly requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and exchange transfusion. He received hydroxychloroquine, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis. Despite showing clinical signs of improvement, he became acutely hypoxemic and suffered a cardiac arrest. We believe this to be an unusual case of a pediatric patient with HbSC disease and COVID-19. We outline clearly the course of illness and treatments trialed, which can prove beneficial to providers facing similar challenges as this virus continues to strike areas around the world.

This accentuates the need for a therapy that can reduce the severity of COVID-19. Clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of remdesivir in shortening recovery time and decreasing progression to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. However, some studies have highlighted its lack of efficacy in patients on high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation. This study uncovers some underlying immune response differences between responders and non-responders to remdesivir treatment. Immunological analyses revealed an upregulation of tissue repair factors BDNF, PDGF-BB and PIGF-1, as well as an increase in ratio of Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 to Th1-associated cytokine IFN-γ. Serological profiling of IgG subclasses corroborated this observation, with significantly higher magnitude of increase in Th2-associated IgG2 and IgG4 responses.

In respiratory diseases such as Covid-19, the transmission rate of the disease is high and the highest risk has always been healthcare workers during pandemic periods. Our aim the present study is to measure medical students anxiety levels and the different variables affecting their anxiety during unusual Covid-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional study was conducted on medical students. Coronavirus Anxiety Scale and the Beck Anxiety Inventory tests applied to all students. An online-based platform was used to distribute the survey developed by using the Google Forms. A total of 370 medical students participated in the survey. In this study 67.3 % (n = 249) of the participants were female and 32.7 % (n = 121) were male. 55.7 % (n = 206) of the participants were preclinical students, 44.4 % (n = 164) were clinical students. There was a statistically significant difference in anxiety levels according to gender and grades. We found that the prevalence of severe anxiety was higher in female students than in male students.

10.1111/bcpt.13798,GABAA receptors as targets for anaesthetics and analgesics and promising candidates to help treat coronavirus infections: A mini‐review,"GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter that regulates the balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the human nervous system. The GABA receptors are divided into three main subtypes, GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC (also termed GABAA rho) receptors. GABAA receptors are pentameric ligand‐gated ion channels widely expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. The activation of GABAA receptors results in opening of an anion‐selective channel that mainly gates chloride ions and allows them to flow into the neuron, causing hyperpolarization of the cell membrane that dampens neural excitability. This makes GABAA receptors critical anaesthetic and analgesic targets for existing as well as for the development of novel drugs. In this review, we first summarize the biochemical properties of GABAA receptors and the clinical anaesthetics and analgesics targeting the receptors. In a forward‐looking section, we summarize the emerging role of GABAergic signalling in treatment of COVID‐19 related infections. Finally, we discuss the opportunities arising from targeting specific and unique subunit interfaces for the development of novel anaesthetics and analgesics leading to more efficient therapies.",2022.0,2022-09-27,17,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c064def535f19c14f273b3c17dcabd9b676a1

Despite being a priority group, the vaccine uptake among healthcare workers (HCWs) remains low. Aim This article assessed the COVID-19 vaccine uptake and its associated barriers in Malawi. Setting A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs in Malawi’s Blantyre, Lilongwe and Mzuzu districts from 11 April 2023 to 14 April 2023. Methods Proportionally distributed among various cadres, 200 participants were randomly selected. A structured questionnaire was administered, assessing HCWs’ uptake, willingness, attitudes and barriers to COVID-19 vaccines. Data were managed in REDCap and analysed using STATA version 14. Frequencies and percentages were computed. Variables with p-value ≤ 0.25 were included in the multivariable modified passion model. Results A total of 175 (88%) participants received a single-dose vaccine, while only 11.5% received a booster. Vaccine uptake was associated with age groups 25–34 years (aPR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.21, 4.60) and 35–44 years (aPR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.18, 4.50), being a nurse/midwife (aPR = 0.86, CI: 0.74, 0.99) and laboratory personnel (aPR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). Unvaccinated HCWs were concerned about vaccine side effects and lacked trust in the development process. Conclusion Issues of vaccine safety, side effects and lack of trust in the vaccine should be addressed.

The original pragmatic cohort-randomized controlled trial was designed to compare the effectiveness of an 8-week group weight management program, ShipShape, to a version of ShipShape enhanced with acceptance and commitment therapy. Objective The objective of our study was to assess potential differences between in-person and virtual participation in participants’ demographics, motivation, confidence, credibility, expectations, and satisfaction with the interventions; we also examined the pragmatics of the technology and participants’ experiences in virtual-format intervention groups. Methods A total of 178 active-duty personnel who had failed or were at risk of failing their physical fitness assessment or were overweight or obese were enrolled in the study. In-person (n=149) and virtual (n=29) participants reported demographics, motivation, confidence, credibility, expectations, and satisfaction. Interventionists recorded attendance and participation in the group sessions. Independent-sample 2-tailed t tests and chi-square tests were used to compare the characteristics of the in-person and virtual participants. Pragmatics of the technology and participants’ experiences in the virtual format were assessed through surveys and open-ended questions. Results Participants were 29.7 (SD 6.9) years old on average, 61.8% (110/178) female, and 59.6% (106/178) White and had an average BMI of 33.1 (SD 3.9) kg/m2. Participants were highly motivated to participate and confident in their ability to complete a weight management program. A total of 82.6% (147/178) of all participants attended 5 of the 8 sessions, and participation was rated as “excellent” by interventionists in both formats. The interventions were found to be credible and to have adequate expectations for effectiveness and high satisfaction in both formats. There were no differences between in-person and virtual participants in any of these metrics, other than interventionist-rated participation, for which virtual participants had significantly higher ratings (P<.001). Technical satisfaction with the virtual sessions was rated as “good” to “very good,” and participants were satisfied with the content of the virtual sessions. A word cloud of responses identified “mindfulness,” “helpful,” “different,” “food,” “binder,” and “class” as concepts the virtual participants found most useful about the program. Conclusions Modifications made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were successful, given the recruitment of active-duty personnel with similar demographic characteristics, attendance levels, and indicators of credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction in the virtual format and the in-person format. This successful transition provides support for the use of virtual or digital weight management interventions to increase accessibility and reach among highly mobile active-duty personnel.

10.3390/nu14245204,Correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D/D3 Deficiency and COVID-19 Disease Severity in Adults from Northern Colorado,"Vitamin D deficiency is common in the United States and leads to altered immune function, including T cell and macrophage activity that may impact responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study investigated 131 adults with a history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR and 18 adults with no COVID-19 diagnosis that were recruited from the community or hospital into the Northern Colorado Coronavirus Biorepository (NoCo-COBIO). Participants consented to enrollment for a period of 6 months and provided biospecimens at multiple visits for longitudinal analysis. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were quantified by LC-MS/MS at the initial visit (n = 149) and after 4 months (n = 89). Adults were classified as deficient (<30 nM or <12 ng/mL), insufficient (<30–50 nM or 12–20 ng/mL), or optimal (50–75 nM or >20 ng/mL) for 25-hydroxyvitamin D status. Fisher’s exact test demonstrated an association between disease severity, gender, and body mass index (BMI) at baseline. Mixed model analyses with Tukey-Kramer were used for longitudinal analysis according to BMI. Sixty-nine percent (n = 103) of the entire cohort had optimal levels of total 25(OH)D, 22% (n = 32) had insufficient levels, and 9% (n = 14) had deficent levels. Participants with severe disease (n = 37) had significantly lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (total 25(OH)D) when compared to adults with mild disease (p = 0.006) or no COVID-19 diagnosis (p = 0.007). There was 44% of the cohort with post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) as defined by experiencing at least one of the following symptoms after 60 days’ post-infection: fatigue, dyspnea, joint pain, chest pain, forgetfulness or absent-mindedness, confusion, or difficulty breathing. While significant differences were detected in 25-hydroxyvitamin D status by sex and BMI, there were no correlations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D for those without and without PASC. This longitudinal study of COVID-19 survivors demonstrates an important association between sex, BMI, and disease severity for 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency during acute stages of infection, yet it is not clear whether supplementation efforts would influence long term outcomes such as developing PASC.",2022.0,2022-12-01,6,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c897a5fc7cd183a9bf186e886db1671f09d7c
10.5334/jime.801,A Strategic Institutional Response to Micro-Credentials: Key Questions for Educational Leaders,"This article responds to the rise of the micro-credential movement. It evidences the heightened attention politicians, policy-makers and educational leaders are giving to micro-credentials by framing the discussion in several recent high-level policy developments, an exponential growth in the number of academic publications and the increasing level of interest shown by popular media. It follows that micro-credentials appear to be high on the change agenda for many higher education institutions (HEIs), especially in the post-COVID-19 environment. However, the emergence of the micro-credential raises several crucial questions for educational leaders, set against fear of missing out. Importantly, the paper identifies a significant gap in the literature regarding leadership and strategic institutional responses to micro-credentials. Indeed, there is a dearth of literature. Leadership is crucial to the success of any educational change or innovation, so five key questions are presented for institutional leaders. They challenge institutions to make strategic decisions around how they engage with and position micro-credentials. If micro-credentials are part of an HEI's change agenda, then serious consideration needs to be given to the type of leadership and internal structures required to develop and execute a successful micro-credential strategy. Consideration must also be given to fit-for-purpose business models and how to mitigate potential risks. We hope to bring these strategic questions to the table as institutions plan, envision and develop their micro-credential strategies. © 2023 The Author(s).",2023.0,,17,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c8d74f1a8fbe44d9b4ea8864803c5481df70d

The participants completed a brief implicit association test and explicit measures to evaluate the extent to which they associated COVID‐19 vaccines with concepts of harmfulness or helpfulness. We examined the relationship between these harmfulness/helpfulness COVID‐19 vaccine associations and vaccination status, intentions, beliefs, and behavior. We found that stronger implicit and explicit associations that COVID‐19 vaccines are helpful relate to vaccination status and beliefs about the COVID‐19 vaccine. That is, stronger pro‐helpful COVID‐19 vaccine associations, both implicitly and explicitly, related to greater intentions to be vaccinated, more positive beliefs about the vaccine, and greater vaccine uptake.",2023.0,2023-10-04,0,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000ca208ce48c555ccc106a185daf44d869639e0

10.3855/jidc.17729,"Consecutive positive nucleic acid tests in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study in Fangcang hospitals, Shanghai.","INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly in Shanghai in February 2022. Patients with asymptomatic and mild symptoms were admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals for centralized quarantine.


METHODOLOGY
A total of 5,217 non-severe patients hospitalized in the Longyao Fangcang and Shilong Fangcang hospitals were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidity, exposure history, treatment and disease duration were analyzed. Univariate analysis and binomial logistic regression analysis were performed to identify the factors influencing nucleic acid change from positive to negative over 14 days.


RESULTS
Consecutive positive nucleic acid test results (days) were significantly associated with advanced age (OR = 1.343, 95% CI 1.143 to 1.578, p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 0.510, 95% CI 0.327 to 0.796, p = 0.003) and vaccination (OR = 0.728, 95% CI 0.641 to 0.827, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference between asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients (p = 0.187). In univariate analysis, comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular system, malignant tumors, autoimmune diseases and cerebral apoplexy were associated with consecutive positive nucleic acid test results, but there was no significant difference in binomial logistics regression analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
Aging and comorbid conditions lead to the prolongation of positive nucleic acid test results for several days. Improving vaccination coverage is beneficial for prevention and control of the epidemic. The management and treatment methods of Shanghai Fangcang shelter hospitals had important referential significance, which can provide valuable guidance for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the future.",2024.0,2024-05-30,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d6f39056f1dd4345246111481db9c720dcda7

10.1111/1467-9477.12285,Rightwing populism and public opinion on the Covid‐19 pandemic in Sweden: The role of strategic party positioning and political cues,"During the early stages of the Covid‐19 pandemic, the Swedish government did not implement the hard lockdowns and coercive measures found in many countries and instead relied on voluntary social distancing measures and work‐from‐home initiatives. Unlike its international counterparts in most countries, the rightwing populist party in Sweden early on took a critical approach toward the government's handling of the Covid‐19 pandemic, calling for stricter government measures to curb virus transmission. Based on theories about strategic party positioning, and theories about political elite cues and framing effects, we use Swedish survey data from the early stages of the pandemic to show that the views of rightwing populist party supporters aligned with the rhetoric of the Swedish rightwing populist party in demanding more (rather than less) government intervention to curb the spread of SARS‐COV‐2. Our results suggest that they did so by drawing on core rightwing populist themes of anti‐elitism and nationalism. Hence, our results speak to the role of elite cues and framing in public opinion formation during times of crisis, particularly among rightwing populists, who generally opposed stricter government measures to fight the Covid‐19 pandemic.",2024.0,2024-06-21,0,59,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d8e14942a8397ca8d09f637b0152b8dcaae4e

Objective The main objective of our study is to identify if there are any menstrual disturbances following COVID-19 infection in women. Study design Our study is a retrospective study wherein 700 women recovering from COVID-19 infection were asked about any new menstrual disturbances after the infection. We collected the data using questionnaires and analyzed the data using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 26) (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY). Results Our study showed no dysmenorrhea in 90% of the participants, 81% reported no change in menstrual flow rate, a vast majority (93%) denied experiencing amenorrhea, only 4% reported a new onset of intermenstrual bleeding, and 1% reported postmenopausal bleeding.

In the Indian context, studies on violence against doctors and other medical staff largely focus on supply-demand imbalances in health care, overcrowding, drug shortages, negligence of critical care patients, lack of diagnostic and other essential devices (e.g., X-ray and ultrasound equipment and oxygen cylinders), deaths of patients, and bribery and corruption (collusion between doctors and pharmaceutical companies). While these factors explain such violence against medical personnel partly, we argue that it is largely rooted in a lack of trust in doctors and hospitals, which eroded rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This online learning mode has also influenced students’ motivation in learning, especially in comprehending reading texts. Considering that problem, the researchers sought to investigate how the students regulated their comprehension in reading during an online class. This research used a mixed-method. The questionnaires were distributed to 30 students and analyzed as quantitative data. Then, the researchers chose four students randomly for interview purposes. The interview transcript was used as qualitative data. In conclusion, not all of the students could regulate themselves in comprehending English text during the online class well. Based on the data, students who could regulate themselves in comprehending the English texts during online class should develop the following procedure: (1) implementing learning autonomy, (2) implementing learning focus, and (3) using critical thinking. Meanwhile, students who could not regulate themselves well were inclined to perform minimally.

To respond to this challenge, banking presents an innovation that is Mobile Banking. However, using Mobile Banking services in the community is considered not optimal. The data obtained from the Financial Inclusion Insight shows that only 32.2% of adults know about electronic money and Digital Banking. Due to the lack of utilization of Mobile Banking in the midst of the onslaught of essential digital transformation, it is interesting to know what indicators trigger people to be interested in using Mobile Banking. This study employs the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model to analyze the factors that drive the intention of the students of IAIN Fattahul Muluk Papua to use Mobile Banking. 
This study is explanatory quantitative research and the type of data used is primary data obtained from the distributed questionnaires that use the Likert scale. The method used to take the samples is the Proportionate Stratified Random Sampling technique and the number of respondents is 100 students of IAIN Fattahul Muluk Papua who use Mobile Banking. The data analysis method used in this study is multiple linear regression using the SPSS 24 version application. This study uses 4 main constructs of the UTAUT Model, namely Performance Expectations, Effort Expectations, Social Influences, and Facilitating Conditions to determine their influence on the Behavioral Interests of the students of IAIN Fattahul Muluk Papua in using the Mobile Banking application. 
The results of this study indicate that partially Effort Expectations and Facilitating Conditions have a significant influence on Behavioral Interest with the results of each t count is greater than the t table that is 2.851>1.985 and 5.541>1.985. The Performance Expectations have no significant effect with t count is smaller than t table (0.539<1.985) and Social Influence has a negative influence on Behavioral Interest with t count (-0.141<1.985). Meanwhile, simultaneously, the four variables have a significant influence as proven by the f count value that is greater than the f table, which is 38.76>2.47 with a determination coefficient of 0.645.

SARS-CoV-2-infected cells produce substances that can induce injury to lung cells as the focus of initiation of COVID-19 during the incubation period. These substances bind to receptors on the target cells. Corticosteroids bind to specific intracellular cytoplasmic receptors in target tissues.  The receptor hormone recruits co-activator or co-repressor proteins after dimerizing. In severe COVID-19 patients develop a systemic inflammatory response that leads to lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. Even though evidence consistently supporting the use of steroids in ARDS and pneumonia is hard to come by the potent anti-inflammatory effects of steroids are postulated to prevent the deleterious effects of the severe inflammation seen in COVID pneumonia.

Objectives To evaluate the disease perceptions, distress and burnout among psychiatrists from the Department of Mental Health and Addictions of Pavia in three different times, which correspond to the three main phases of the pandemic management in Italy: T0 is the first peak of the infections and the lock-down, from March to June; T1 is the reduction of the infections and the reopening, from June to October; T2 is the second wave of infections with a new progressive closure, the current one. Methods We used three questionnaires: the BIPQ (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire), the PSS-10 (Perceived Stress Scale-10), the PED (Profile of emotional distress). We also used a survey (6 items) in T0, T1 and T2 to evaluate exposure, perception, quality of life and burnout. Results table 1,2,3. BIPQ: no one was exposed. Conclusions The increase of individual, who seeking help for mental health, impact on the perception of stress and on the emotional distress, even though psychiatrists have an adequate perception of COVID-19.",2021.0,2021-04-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f33bf6251f36cd8d754e19c2ea3e06c858844

During this period, we ended up with the retention of articles, increased the rigor of selection and decreased the average rating of articles from 47 days to 22 days. In 2021 we will continue to work hard to increase the impact of our Journal. The January-February number of Int Braz J Urol, the seventh under my supervision, presents original contributions with a lot of interesting papers in different fields: Prostate Cancer, Male Infertility, Female Incontinence, Renal Cell Carcinoma, Urinary Stones, Testicular migration, Laparoscopy, BPH, Partial Nephrectomy, Nocturnal Enuresis and Bladder Cancer. The papers came from many different countries such as Brazil, USA, Turkey, China, Republic of Korea, Chile, UK, India, Spain and Iran, and as usual the editor ́s comment highlights some of them. In the present issue we present three important papers about Male Infertility. Dr. Bin and colleagues from China performed in page 8 (1) a nice systematic review about the association between body mass index and varicocele and concluded that body mass index is negatively associated with the presence of varicocele. Dr. Cicek and colleagues from Turkey present in page 112 (2) an important study about the association between seminal oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and conventional sperm parameters and shows that the presence of oligozoospermia, reduced progressive motilty or low total motility sperm count in sperm analysis should raise the suspicion of oxidative stress and warrants seminal reactive oxygen species testing and Dr. Groner et al. in page 185 (3) performed on Expert Opinon section an interesting mini-review about the effects of Covid-19 on male reproductive system and suggested that the involvement of the male reproductive system which could be a new route of the disease transmission. The virus has already been found in the semen of infected patients, but it remains to be assessed what impacts it has on male reproductive health. The editor in chief would like to highlight the following works too: Dr. Ouyang and collegues from China presented in page 23 (4) a nice systematic review about medical expulsive therapy and ESWL and shows that Adjunctive medical expulsive therapy with tamsulosin is effective in patients with specific stone size or location that received repeated ESWL. However, no well-designed randomized controlled trial that used computed tomography for the detection and assessment of residual stone fragments was found.

10.7759/cureus.57441,COVID-19-Associated Rhino-Orbito-Cerebral Mucormycosis: A Single Tertiary Care Center Experience of Imaging Findings With a Special Focus on Intracranial Manifestations and Pathways of Intracranial Spread,"Background and objective The COVID-19 pandemic and mucormycosis epidemic in India made research on the radiological findings of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis imperative. This study aims to describe the imaging findings in COVID-19-associated mucormycosis, with a special focus on the intracranial manifestations. Methodology Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of all patients with laboratory-proven mucormycosis and post-COVID-19 status, for two months, at an Indian Tertiary Care Referral Centre, were retrospectively reviewed, and descriptive statistical analysis was carried out. Results A total of 58 patients (47 men, 81%, and 11 women, 19%) were evaluated. Deranged blood glucose levels were observed in 47 (81%) cases. The intracranial invasion was detected in 31 (53.4%) patients. The most common finding in cases with intracranial invasion was pachymeningeal enhancement (28/31, 90.3%). This was followed by infarcts (17/31, 55%), cavernous sinus thrombosis (11/58, 18.9%), fungal abscesses (11/31, 35.4%), and intracranial hemorrhage (5/31, 16.1% cases). The perineural spread was observed in 21.6% (11/51) cases. Orbital findings included extraconal fat and muscle involvement, intraconal involvement, orbital apicitis, optic neuritis, panophthalmitis, and orbital abscess formation in decreasing order of frequency. Cohen’s kappa coefficient of interrater reliability for optic nerve involvement and cavernous sinus thrombosis was 0.7. Cohen’s coefficient for all other findings was 0.8-0.9. Conclusions COVID-19-associated rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis has a plethora of orbital and intracranial manifestations. MRI, with its superior soft-tissue resolution and high interrater reliability, as elucidated in this study, is the imaging modality of choice for expediting the initial diagnosis, accurately mapping out disease extent, and promptly identifying and scrupulously managing its complications.",2024.0,2024-04-01,0,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00107b68ae1b2a4c01d8595636bc979f667dea6f

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the application of telehealth and telemedicine in the human coronavirus epidemic.

Materials and Methods: The systematic search was conducted in Medline (through PubMed), Scopus, and ISI Web of Science to identify relevant studies published until June 10, 2020. Inclusion criteria included studies in which telemedicine and telehealth were utilized as healthcare services in COVID-19, SARS, or MERS epidemics. This review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines.

Results: A total of 598 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After the systematic screening, 18 studies were met our criteria. The analysis showed that only one study was related to SARS, and the rest were on COVID-19 disease. Teleconsultation and televisit had a high percentage (55.6%) among other types of telemedicine services. The most mentioned obstacles were access to suitable technologies and lack of assessment or follow-up to achieve outcomes.

Conclusion: The results showed that telehealth and telemedicine could have advantages such as preventing the spread of COVID-19, reducing the healthcare burden, and maintaining appropriate patient care. In addition to these benefits, several limitations and obstacles, including organizational, technological, and patient-related barriers, may be encountered, so it is better to consider the necessary arrangements before implementing telemedicine.",2021.0,2021-08-09,2,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0010df4d09992b2d9a9432aeb7f00403854a92f9

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091722,Security Analysis of End-to-End Encryption for Zoom Meetings,"In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, video conference systems have become essential for not only business purposes, but also private, academic, and educational uses. Among the various systems, Zoom is the most widely deployed video conference system. In October 2020, Zoom Video Communications rolled out their end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to protect conversations in a meeting from even insiders, namely, the service provider Zoom. In this study, we conduct thorough security evaluations of the E2EE of Zoom (version 2.3.1) by analyzing their cryptographic protocols. We discover several attacks more powerful than those expected by Zoom according to their whitepaper. Specifically, if insiders collude with meeting participants, they can impersonate any Zoom user in target meetings, whereas Zoom indicates that they can impersonate only the current meeting participants. Besides, even without relying on malicious participants, insiders can impersonate any Zoom user in target meetings though they cannot decrypt meeting streams. In addition, we demonstrate several impersonation attacks by meeting participants or insiders colluding with meeting participants. Although these attacks may be beyond the scope of the security claims made by Zoom or may be already mentioned in the whitepaper, we reveal the details of the attack procedures and their feasibility in the real-world setting and propose effective countermeasures in this paper. Our findings are not an immediate threat to the E2EE of Zoom; however, we believe that these security evaluations are of value for deeply understanding the security of E2EE of Zoom.",2021.0,,17,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00123d4b43ca013947b955d54d3bd42eb1382ced

Till date, there exists no modest therapeutic agent to combat this virus. Antibodies in the breast milk of convalescent lactating mothers could be the silver bullet that would deflate the ballooning morbidity and mortality rate caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Coupled with the fact that breast milk contains a very high amount of Immunoglobulin A which has a desirable higher in vivo stability than other antibodies. This novel approach of purifying antibodies from the breast milk of convalescent lactating mothers is a non-invasive technique relative to the conventional method of using convalescent plasma which had proven effective for generating passive immunity against the seasonal flu. Purified Immunoglobulins would be obtained by adding an equal volume of ammonium sulphate solution to the breast milk sample to induce a lyotropic effect and thereafter passing the partially purified solution through a column chromatographic system impregnated with a Jaclin –lectin, Protein A, L and G. Neutralizing antibodies would by assayed using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay technique.

Understanding cytokines, which are key in generating unique immune responses from pathogenic organisms, is important for creating vaccines. 
Objective: In order to better understand cytokines and how the current COVID-19 vaccinations can assist reactivate latent cytokines, the scientific community and the general public must be educated. 
Materials and Methods: Medical and scientific indexing sources like PubMed and Google Scholar were used to search for relevant medical and scientific publications. 
Results: After vaccination, cytokines in the immune system can be activated, which can help signal chemicals that can increase the immune system's ability to fight against new and break-through COVID 19 infections. 
Conclusion:  It has been discovered that both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines are safe and effective in preventing break through COVID-19 infections, regardless of whether the patient experiences symptoms or not.

10.35882/ijahst.v2i1.1,The Relationship Between Merchants Knowledge and Attitude Toward the Obedience of Mask Use in Preventing Covid-19,"The COVID-19 outbreak began in December 2019. In preventing its transmission, society across the world agrees to use a mask for their safety. However, today, people, primarily some merchants who sell their stuff around the tourism places, still do not obey the regulation to wear a mask. Hence, this study aims to know the relationship between merchant knowledge and attitude toward the obedience of using a mask in preventing the COVID-19 transmission at the religious tourism of Sunan Bonang Tuban. The research design used in this study is the correlation analysis that uses a cross-sectional approach. Moreover, the sampling technique used in this study is Simple Random Sampling with 105 populations and 83 samples of merchants. The data technique used in this study is a questionnaire. Then, the researcher analyzes the questionnaire with a percentage and does a crosstab by using the Spearman Rank Correlation test. The finding of this study presents that most of the merchants at religious tourism of Sunan Bonang Tuban have good knowledge in preventing COVID-19 transmission. It is about Forty-nine people (59,0%). Then, fifty people (60,2%) have a positive attitude. Moreover, the finding presents that almost half of the merchants, thirty-five people (42,2%), obey the regulation to wear the mask. The result of Spearman Rank Correlation test is α =0.00 < 0.05. This result shows the relationship between knowledge and obedience in using the mask. The result of the test is α =0.00 < 0.001 shows there is a relationship between the attitude and the obedience in using the mask of merchants to prevent COVID-19 at the religious tourism of Sunan Bonang Tuban. The knowledge and attitude of merchants influence their obedience in using the mask. It means that the more increased merchants' knowledge and attitude, the more increased merchant obedience. In increasing and encouraging other merchants' knowledge and attitude, the government must have a good strategy. One of the appropriate strategies is doing counseling of using a mask to prevent COVID-19 transmission. ",2022.0,2022-01-17,1,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00139e9a44bd93e59d2f5af3120d090867ae3dea

This article aims to assess how these reactions have impacted European Union (EU) and Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) inter-regional relations, considering multiple and sometimes incompatible approaches taken by national and regional actors. The article contends that the existence of contrasting approaches – coupled with previous institutional and political challenges faced by the EU and LAC regional organisations – have undermined the convergence of national health policies into regional ones, and the promotion of multilateral responses and institutions in a post-pandemic world. First, focus is given to the main characteristics and institutional features of contemporary EU-LAC relations, usually conceived as a multidimensional and multi-tier relationship. Second, it introduces how EU and LAC countries and regional organisations have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating distinct ways that EU-LAC actors have engaged with the outbreak and the main challenges and successes for regional cooperation in this respect. Lastly, the main developments and challenges for EU-LAC overall relations in pandemic times are indicated, highlighting how EU-LAC actors have attempted to cooperate in order to develop a more positive and sustainable inter-regional partnership for the future.",2022.0,,3,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0013dffed66de2346cb832a8cf57cf419226c802

Our study aimed at the longitudinal analysis of antibody persistence and its dynamic trend over a period of eight months in a group of COVID-19 recovered patients who tested positive by real-time quantitative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the period between the 18th and 30th of March, 2020. The subjects were divided into two groups based on disease severity: mild and moderately-severe. The MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV lgM/lgG chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) assay was used to analyse the antibody titres. Robust IgG antibody persistency was demonstrated in 76.7 % of the subjects (23 out of 30) at eight months post infection. The results of this study highlight an important point in terms of the association between humoral immune response and disease severity. Patients who might have experienced a relatively moderate-severe infection may develop a robust immunity that could persist for a longer duration.",2020.0,2020-11-23,1,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00144899eb9eb8437b915fdc571108d3d9853c54

This study takes a mixed method approach to assess the impact of COVID-19 on malaria control programs in three rural communes in Benin. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with key informants who play important roles in malaria control in Benin at three levels of the health system–national, health zone, and commune. Using a purposive sampling technique, informants were interviewed regarding their roles in malaria control, the impact of the pandemic on their activities, and the mitigation strategies adopted. Relevant themes were identified by content analysis. We then formulated an agent-based model of malaria epidemiology to assess the impacts of treatment disruption on malaria burden. The key informant interviews revealed that essential aspects of malaria control were upheld in Benin due to the close collaboration of public health practitioners and health care providers at all levels of the health system. There were some disruptions to case management services for malaria at the start of the pandemic due to the public avoiding health centers and a brief shortage of malaria treatment that may not be entirely attributable to the pandemic. Results from the agent-based model suggest that duration, severity, and timing of treatment disruption can impact malaria burden in a synergistic manner, though the effects are small given the relatively mild disruptions observed. This study highlights the importance of top-down leadership in health emergencies, as well as the critical role of community health workers in preventing negative health outcomes for their communities. We also showcased the integration of qualitative research and mathematical models–an underappreciated form of mixed methods research that offer immense value in the continued evaluation of rapidly evolving health emergencies.",2024.0,2024-02-02,0,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001474dc5892d47040f977a07018df712b8e4686

10.33503/prosiding.v1i01.1073,Evaluasi Pembelajaran Online pada Masa Pandemic Covid -19 di Perguruan Tinggi di Kota Pekalongan,"One of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesian education is the implementation of online learning which seems to be forced because in terms of infrastructure and human resources it is not sufficient. The purpose of this research is to find and map the advantages and disadvantages of online learning so that in the end it can be a recommendation for improvement and enhancement of online learning. This research is a quantitative descriptive study with data sources from the results of questionnaires to students at higher education institutions in Pekalongan. The questionnaire is in the form of closed and open questions. 
The results of this study indicate that the average score of online learning evaluations gets a score of 89 (70%) which belongs to the high criteria. This means that the implementation of online learning in higher education institutions is good from the learning planning stage to the assessment stage. From the six elements of the online learning process that are measured, namely the learning contract, learning objectives and learning outcomes, assessment, lecture material, student involvement and student learning resources respectively get a score of 68%, 69%, 71%, 68%, 72%, and 71%. 
However, students still provide criticism and suggestions for improvements to lecturers, learning, online infrastructure and financing.

Since intact (socio-)psychological functioning and mental health are protective factors contributing to the immune system and preventing diseases, it is crucial to identify individuals with increased vulnerability. Methods: We conducted a German online survey from April until August 2020 investigating health-related, social, behavioral, and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred and seventy three adults participating in the survey were analyzed (39.9% male, age: M = 44.81±13.31). We explored effects on mental health by (a) clustering participants in two clusters and (b) analyzing the clusters using correlations and regression models. Results: Participants belonged either to a cluster characterized by higher general well-being or to a more concerned cluster depending on their responses. The correlation analysis revealed a significant negative relation between age and well-being with younger participants revealing higher depression scores in the concerned cluster. Furthermore, multiple regression models revealed that the number of risk factors only has a significant influence on psychological well-being in the concerned but not in the comfortable cluster. Conclusion: We found that especially participants at (a) younger age and (b) greater risk of a severe course of disease reported reduced mental well-being and seemed to be weakened in their psychological protective factors in our sample. These insights allow to provide tailored recommendations for preventive and immediate actions to promote psychological well-being and reduce stress.",2021.0,2021-07-08,12,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0015a2a7c5fc211a15417fbe15c8500832bcaa8b

The success of a vaccine depends not only on its efficacy but also on its acceptance. Our study aims to define COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in a sample of pregnant and lactating women in Poland. Since mothers are often key decision-makers for whether their children will receive vaccination, it is vital to measure vaccine confidence among this group. Patients and Methods An anonymous online survey was distributed to assess the level of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant and lactating women for themselves and their children in Poland. Results The trust of pregnant and breastfeeding women and women who have offspring in government, in healthcare professionals, in scientific authorities, and sound scientific data is strongly associated with vaccine acceptance and may influence an individual’s decision to perceive recommended actions as beneficial to the society as a whole. Conclusion Acceptance and confidence in receiving the COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant and lactating women and mothers with young children is strongly associated with feelings of trust in government, health professionals, scientific authorities, and sound scientific data.

10.3389/fpubh.2023.1078008,SDG5 “Gender Equality” and the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid assessment of health system responses in selected upper-middle and high-income countries,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare and societies, exacerbating existing inequalities for women and girls across every sphere. Our study explores health system responses to gender equality goals during the COVID-19 pandemic and inclusion in future policies. Methods We apply a qualitative comparative approach, drawing on secondary sources and expert information; the data was collected from March–July 2022. Australia, Brazil, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the USA were selected, reflecting upper-middle and high-income countries with established public health and gender policies but different types of healthcare systems and epidemiological and geo-political conditions. Three sub-goals of SDG5 were analyzed: maternity care/reproductive health, gender-based violence, and gender equality/women's leadership. Results We found similar trends across countries. Pandemic policies strongly cut into women's health, constrained prevention and support services, and weakened reproductive rights, while essential maternity care services were kept open. Intersecting gender inequalities were reinforced, sexual violence increased and women's leadership was weak.

10.4045/TIDSSKR.20.0325,«Hvileskjær» i pandemien må brukes til bedre planlegging for de eldste,"Det er ikke riktig å utsette pasienter for inngripende og ofte plagsom behandling som ikke er til nytte for dem. Både intensivleger (2) og geriatere (3) har forbilledlig påpekt dette i offentligheten. I begge fagmiljøer er det enighet om at frailty, som på norsk gjerne oversettes med «skrøpelighet», indikerer sannsynlig manglende nytte av intensivbehandling og er et bedre seleksjonskriterium enn alder (4). Skrøpelige pasienter har høy dødelighet av covid-19 fordi de er skrøpelige, ikke fordi det er mangel på respiratorer. Det gjelder også for dem som er blitt skrøpelige til tross for at de ikke er veldig gamle. Men skal dette resonnementet være gyldig, må det også kunne brukes omvendt: Gamle pasienter som ikke er skrøpelige, men derimot spreke (engelsk: fit), bør ikke nektes intensiveller respiratorbehandling på grunnlag av kronologisk alder (5). Muntlige rapporter fra flere sykehus tyder på at mange nå anvender kronologiske aldersgrenser for intensivbehandling av covid-19-pasienter. Hvis krisen blir prekær, kan vi bli tvunget til å prioritere dem som har flest gjenstående leveår. Men vi er langt fra den situasjonen foreløpig. Slik forholdene er nå, har vi mulighet til å intensivbehandle dem som har rimelig sjanse til komme igjennom det.",2020.0,2020-04-17,4,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00175dc8ef3c0e0bdda36679ac55bbcf78b0a321
10.2478/ethemes-2022-0001,Measuring the Impact of the Coviid-19 Crisis on the Foreign Tourist Receipts,"Abstract Tourism is a significant economic activity for developing any national economy and the world economy as well. Revenues generated through tourism services affect GDP and directly stimulate economic growth. The revenues are important for the national economies, i.e. the foreign exchange inflow, generated through tourist services export. However, many factors directly impact on the volume of foreign tourist arrivals, and thus directly affect both foreign exchange inflows and GDP. Government measures taken for various reasons that have a straight impact on the movement of people significantly reduce tourist travels. It can cause numerous and robust adverse effects on the national economy. The health crisis caused by the pandemic COVID – 19 has led to restrictive governmental measures that had a negative impact on tourist travels, and thus on the revenues generated from the export of tourist services. The paper aims to measure the effect of the COVID - 19 crises on the income generated by the foreign tourists’ arrivals in Ohrid, as a case study destination in North Macedonia. The research results will show the losses this economic sector has suffered from the “lockdown” caused by the pandemic.",2022.0,2022-03-01,3,13,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00178ea34a38272be6f544c5c4c7ba2a5cffc64f

In the context of a highly contagious communicable disease, telemedicine is a useful alternative to usual care, and should be considered as a means to support healthcare professionals’ mental health. This is a multicenter (n = 19), cross-sectional study, based on a 27-item questionnaire, aiming to investigate the acceptability to healthcare workers of a telepsychiatry service as a means of providing mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between October and December 2020, 321 responses were received, showing that women, caregiving staff, and those directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients are less favorable to the idea of receiving remote support. In our population, barriers were related to the clinical setting or ethics, and most of the respondents would not accept a drug prescription by telepsychiatry. Although telepsychiatry should be a part of the armamentarium of mental health management, it is not suitable as a stand-alone approach, and should be combined with conventional face-to-face consultations.",2021.0,2021-09-27,6,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00179d12a7a1eda5bc07abcb1de6033bf8b68c0c

Many businesses promoted social distancing through the announcement of compulsory work-from-home. In this backdrop, Remote Work has become a significant model mainly to retain talent and attrition. The present study analyses whether work-life integration and work-life satisfaction are related to psychological well-being. Research hypotheses are formulated based on the investigation of the literature review. This data was collected in India during July and October 2020 while the Covid pandemic was coming down to normal. The survey was aimed at people who work in Indian-based companies. Workers received an electronic version of the questionnaire, and organizations received e-mail requests. The decision was made to use the comfort sampling method. During the pandemic, a sample of 400 employees from the Information Technology industry in the cities of Hyderabad and Bangalore, India. Work-Life integration leading to Psychological Well-being were analyzed considering the role of work-life satisfaction as a mediator. This research focuses on job and life satisfaction, showing the mechanisms that help workers in remote working conditions stay mentally healthy during a pandemic. This mediation study revealed that Work-life satisfaction has an optimistic and robust relationship with psychological health, with this relationship being influenced by work satisfaction and life satisfaction among the Indian IT companies surveyed. These studies' findings suggest that a successful workfrom- home community is built on a foundation of work-life integration based on contentment. The research findings are that positive work-life integration contributes to employees' positive levels of psychological well-being. We found that the higher the job and life satisfaction, the better the psychological well-being. Since the current study is a cross-sectional analysis, there are some restrictions on how long the investigation can last. Longitudinal research should be conducted to improve the results of the studies. ",2023.0,2023-02-06,0,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0018130f21cac968fcbd11548a39b7e4b4b62da9
10.1002/ams2.626,Medicine at mass gatherings: current progress of preparedness of emergency medical services and disaster medical response during 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games from the perspective of the Academic Consortium (AC2020),"Mass gatherings are events characterized by “the concentration of people at a specific location for a specific purpose over a set period of time that have the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the host country or community.” Previous reports showed that, as a result of the concentration of people in the limited area, injury and illness occurred due to several factors. The response plan should aim to provide timely medical care to the patients and to reduce the burden on emergency hospitals, and to maintain a daily emergency medical services system for residents of the local area. Although a mass gathering event will place a significant burden on the local health‐care system, it can provide the opportunity for long‐term benefits of public health‐care and improvement of daily medical service systems after the end of the event. The next Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held in Tokyo, during which mass gatherings will occur on a daily basis in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) epidemic. The Academic Consortium on Emergency Medical Services and Disaster Medical Response Plan during the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020 (AC2020) was launched 2016, consisting of 28 academic societies in Japan, it has released statements based on assessments of medical risk and publishing guidelines and manuals on its website.

This is a monocentric prospective study performed on 125 male patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We conducted hematological examination, blood biochemical profile, hemostasis analysis and hormonal examination (T and DHT levels) lung and chest computed tomography and also assessed outcomes of hospitalization. Low DHT serum level was found only in 18 patients (14.4%). Subjects with low DHT were significantly older compare to subjects with normal DHT. At the same time in patients with normal DHT white blood cells (WBC) count, neutrophils at admission were higher than in patients with low DHT. No correlation was observed between T and DHT serum blood levels. C-reactive protein (CRP) has a weak positive correlation of DHT serum blood concentration (r = 0.22; p = 0.016). The inverse pattern was obtained for T serum blood concentration (r = −0.285; p = 0.001). After divided all males according to T concentrations we conducted next correlation analysis for DHT and CRP in two different groups: with normal T levels and with low T levels. We found that in males with normal T DHT levels are not correlated with CRP (r = 0.095; p = 0.462). However, in males with low T DHT and CRP had weak positive correlation with r = 0.317 (p = 0.012). Higher DHT concentrations are associated with higher CRP levels, however correlation is weak and in patients with normal T is absent, that may indicate anti-inflammatory effect of T and possible proinflammatory effect of DHT.",2023.0,,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001867b2bca6c6a7af693b1ce7438a3d82c0ba5a

10.52872/001c.39792,The present value of human life losses associated with COVID-19 in South Africa,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to ravage both the health and economy of South Africa. This study estimated the total present value of human life (TPVHL) losses associated with COVID-19 in South Africa. The human capital approach (HCA) was used to value the 101,146 human life losses associated with COVID-19 in South Africa as of 30 May 2022 – assuming South Africa’s average life expectancy of 64.88 years and a 3% discount rate. The TPVHL was the sum of discounted values of human life (VHL) across the 17 age groups. The PVHL for each age group is the product of the sum of discounted years of life lost per person, gross domestic product per capita net of current health expenditure per person, and the number of COVID-19 deaths borne by a specific age group. During sensitivity analysis, the HCA model was reanalysed four times alternately, assuming a 5% discount rate, 10% discount rate, Africa’s highest average life expectancy of 78.76 years (Algeria females), and the world’s highest life expectancy of 88.17 years (Hong Kong females). The 101,146 human lives lost had a TPVHL of Int$7,566,656,063, and an average of Int$74,809 per human life lost to COVID-19. Subsequent re-calculation of the model with a 5% and 10% discount rates diminished the TPVHL by Int$1,177,446,403 (15.6%) and Int$2,997,459,371 (39.6%), respectively. Further, a reanalysis of the model with Africa’s highest average life expectancy and the world’s highest life expectancy triggered growth in the TPVHL of Int$8,846,142,813 (116.9%) and Int$15,363,165,669 (203.04%), respectively. The average discounted value per human life lost to COVID-19 of Int$74,809 is five-fold the GDP per capita for South Africa in 2022, setting the country back a few years in terms of socio-economic development. Thus, COVID-19 continues to have a significant negative impact on the life and livelihoods of South Africans. The economic evidence complements the human rights case for increased domestic investment into health-related systems to bridge the gaps in coverage of health development-related services.",2022.0,2022-11-13,5,72,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0018e1c02a4a42e472b50e5b4e3a8a88a83428ef

The current pandemic has produced startling images of empty supermarket shelves, shortages of farm workers, increased use of food banks and heightened concern over the health of those at the lower end of the socio-economic scale. We argue that food insecurity was not created by the current pandemic but is a serious underlying issue in the UK, which has not been adequately considered in discussions about Brexit. In other words, the pandemic has simply highlighted the risk that Brexit will worsen food insecurity and the health of those already disadvantaged.

The Basic Reproduction Number (R_0) represents viral spread rate and can be dramatically modified by the application of effective public control measures. However, current methodologies to calculate R_0 from data remain cumbersome and unusable during an outbreak. Objective: To provide a simple mathematical formulation for obtaining R_0 in Real-Time, and apply it to assess the effectiveness of public-health policies in different iconic countries. Study design: By modifying the equations describing the spread of the virus, we derived a real-time $R_0$ estimator that can be readily calculated from daily official case reports. Results: We show the application of a time trend analysis of the R_0 estimator to assess the efficacy and promptness of public health measures that impacted on the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in iconic countries.

10.5334/aogh.3005,Mental Health Status of Healthcare Workers in China for COVID-19 Epidemic,"Background: COVID-19 first appeared in China in December 2019, with a high rate of infectivity and morbidity, which brought tremendous psychological pressure to healthcare workers. Purpose: To understand the psychological health status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and decline, and to provide a theoretical reference for the future establishment of a psychological crisis intervention system. Methods: Healthcare workers were recruited using convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods, and the electronic version of the SCL-90 scale and a sociodemographic questionnaire were administered. In the pretest, a total of 5018 responses were collected; after six weeks, random sampling was performed. The SCL-90 and measures of other epidemic-related problems were administered, with 1570 responses received; then, the final data analysis was performed. Results: After six weeks, the post-test GSI score; SCL-90 total score; and PST, PSDI, O-C, I-S, DEP, ANX, PHOB, PAR, PSY, and HOS scores were significantly lower than the corresponding pretest scores (p < 0.05). The results by occupational category showed that the scores of nursing staff decreased significantly for 12 indexes and that the scores of the doctors and other hospital staff also significantly decreased. There was a significant difference between the pretest (50.78 ± 28.18) and post-test (45.00 ± 28.49) scores for the degree of worry about the epidemic. Healthcare workers believed that the top three aspects of life affected by the epidemic were economic problems (816 people), interpersonal communication problems (731 people), and mental health (728 people). Conclusion: Over the course of the epidemic, the item scores generally declined significantly. Therefore, during an outbreak period, attention should be paid to psychological crisis interventions for healthcare workers; problems caused by psychological pressure, and even other psychological conditions, can be significantly alleviated to reduce the probability of subsequent health problems.",2020.0,2020-10-06,54,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00196f4a65b8b465688c72d0f09f049e77b2ab65

10.1371/journal.pone.0278557,Quality of life among patients with the common chronic disease during COVID-19 pandemic in Northwest Ethiopia: A structural equation modelling,"Background Improving Quality of Life (QoL) for patients with chronic diseases is a critical step in controlling disease progression and preventing complications. The COVID-19 pandemic has hampered chronic disease management, lowering patients’ quality of life. Thus, we aimed to assess the quality of life and its determinants in patients with common chronic diseases, in Northwest Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1815 randomly selected chronic patients with common chronic diseases. A standardized WHOQOL BREF tool was used, and electronic data collection was employed with the kobo toolbox data collection server. Overall QoL and the domains of Health-Related Quality of life (HRQoL) were determined. Structural equation modelling was done to estimate independent variables’ direct and indirect effects. Path coefficients with a 95% confidence interval were reported. Results About one in third, (33.35%) and 11.43% of the study participants had co-morbid conditions and identified complications, respectively. The mean score of QoL was 56.3 ranging from 14.59 and 98.95. The environmental domain was the most affected domain of HRQoL with a mean score of 52.18. Age, psychological, and environmental domains of HRQoL had a direct positive effect on the overall QoL while the physical and social relationships domains had an indirect positive effect. On the other hand, the number of medications taken, the presence of comorbidity, and complications had a direct negative impact on overall QoL. Furthermore, both rural residency and the presence of complications had an indirect negative effect on overall QoL via the mediator variables of environmental and physical health, respectively. Conclusion The quality of life was compromised in chronic disease patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the environmental domain of HRQoL was the most affected. Several socio-demographic and clinical factors had an impact on QoL, either directly or indirectly. These findings highlighted the importance of paying special attention to rural residents, patients with complications, patients taking a higher number of medications, and patients with comorbidity.",2022.0,2022-12-06,4,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0019cea5c84197d0ecc6b23f1aa33d9e09f08071

Aims and Objectives: In this study, we aimed whether biomedical measurements at the early stage can predict the severity and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. The patients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the internist met the initial eligibility criterion. The patients with medical records of the laboratory indicators and clinical outcomes were included in this study.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective follow-up study, 155 clinically ill patients with COVID-19 were followed up until recovery and death from the disease.
Results: The average age of the COVID-19 patients was 49.7 (Sta. deviation: 16.6) aged between 18 and 90 years. The patients had mild severity of disease (67.10%) followed by moderate (19.36%), severe (7.74%), and critical (5.81%). The study found that 6.45% (n=10) of the patients died and 93.55% (n=145) were recovered from the disease. The concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocytes, and white blood cell were increased with increasing severities and in dead patients. D-dimer and CRP were the main contributing factors to the higher severity of disease and mortality among COVID-19 patients. The contributed symptoms to disease severity were diarrhea, epigastric pain, shortness of breath, headache, and fever. The higher LDH and being male were contributed to higher disease severity.

10.24869/psyd.2022.133,COVID-19 Outbreak: Mitigating Role of College Students' Emotional Intelligence in the Relationship between Psychological Distress and Satisfaction with Life.,"BACKGROUND
While much of the world's attention is focused on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on physical health, the virus's psychological impacts must not be disregarded. Therefore, it is important to understand and document the role of emotional intelligence as a mitigating variable in the relationship between psychological distress and life satisfaction.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
This correlational study was carried out with the participation of 483 college students. Their ages ranged from 18 to 31 (X=20.89, Sd=2.27).


RESULTS
The hierarchical regression analysis results revealed that both emotional intelligence and psychological distress were statistically significant predictors of the participants' levels of satisfaction with life. Moreover, emotional intelligence was a significant moderator in the relationship between psychological distress and life satisfaction.

10.36713/epra18219,CHALLENGES AND BENEFITS OF WORK-FROM-HOME POLICIES IN THE IT SECTOR: AN INDIAN PERSPECTIVE,"The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a widespread shift to remote work, particularly within the IT sector. This study investigates the unique challenges and benefits of work-from-home (WFH) policies in the Indian IT industry. By conducting a mixed-methods research approach, including surveys and interviews with IT professionals and HR managers, we uncover significant insights. The findings reveal that while WFH offers enhanced flexibility, reduced commuting time, and increased job satisfaction, it also presents challenges such as work-life balance disruption, communication barriers, and difficulties in team collaboration. Additionally, the Indian context introduces specific issues like varying internet connectivity and home infrastructure adequacy. The study provides a nuanced understanding of how cultural and socio-economic factors influence the effectiveness of WFH policies. Recommendations for optimizing WFH strategies in the IT sector include investing in digital infrastructure, fostering a supportive remote work culture, and implementing structured communication protocols. This research contributes to the broader discourse on remote work by highlighting the Indian perspective, thereby assisting policymakers and organizations in creating more resilient and inclusive WFH frameworks.

10.23889/ijpds.v8i2.2219,A generalisable linkage pipeline (GLADIS) to facilitate research for the public good,"ObjectivesThe Integrated Data Service (IDS) is a new cross-government service that facilitates research for the public good. Key to its success are Integrated Data Assets (IDAs): de-identified, grouped datasets that are joinable on an artificial ID and themed on a given topic. The Demographic Index (DI) comprises five linked administrative datasets. We are developing a generalisable method that will link administrative and survey datasets to the DI via a customisable, reproducible pipeline, to produce IDAs. 
MethodsThe method focuses on the traditional methodologies of deterministic and probabilistic data linkage and uses the Splink implementation of the Fellegi-Sunter method for probabilistic matching. The pipeline will include a tool for quality-assurance (QA) via clerical review. 
We are researching a generalisable implementation of Splink, deriving the method’s control parameters using the results of the deterministic matching. Additionally, we are researching application of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), a dimensionality-reduction method suggested to improve computational efficiency, for blocking. This is especially important due to the large size of the datasets involved. 
ResultsWe plan to produce linked datasets with three quality levels – prioritising precision, balancing precision and recall and prioritising recall. As the datasets are always linked to the DI, the DI’s artificial ID can be used as a ‘spine’ to bring them together as assets (IDAs). 
Initially, the method will be used on the 2021 England and Wales Census. Despite not including clerical matching in the method (except for quality-assurance), we anticipate a high precision and recall due to the quality of the Census and the number of linkage variables available. Thereafter, we plan for user testing with other datasets, including the Labour Market Survey. 
ConclusionOur generalisable linkage pipeline for the DI will, through its IDA outputs, facilitate research for the public good. This research will directly impact government policy and responses to national health emergencies, including Covid-19, and support government priorities such as Levelling Up and the transition towards Net Zero.",2023.0,2023-09-14,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001b35f692ac5e26d98fcad9ea53ad31e5f4d12c

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health problems of children’s chaperones at the emergency clinic during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and to analyze the related influencing factors. A total of 260 chaperones for children in the emergency department participated in this cross-sectional study through the questionnaire constellation platform. The survey period was from February to June 2021. Information collected included demographic data and mental health scales. The Self-Assessment Scale for Anxiety, the Self-Rating Scale for Depression, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index assessed anxiety, depression, and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic regression was used to analyze influential factors associated with mental health problems. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders among family members accompanying children attending the emergency room was 41.54%, 20.00%, and 93.08%, respectively, with 21.54% of family members suffering from moderate sleep disorders. Univariate analysis showed that being in Wuhan or not during the city closure (X2 = 8.61, P < .01) was strongly associated with the occurrence of depression; female (X2 = 4.87, P = .03), working or not (X2 = 6.39, P = .01) and fear of going to the hospital (X2 = 7.80, P = .01) were key factors for the occurrence of anxiety symptoms; Knowledge of transmission routes and prevention of COVID-19 (X2 = 12.56, P = .03) was a key factor for sleep disorders; logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that fear of going to the hospital was a risk factor for anxiety symptoms (odds ratio = 2.51, P < .01, 95% confidence interval = 1.30–4.85). Our findings suggest that mental health problems were prevalent among family members accompanying children attending the emergency department during the COVID-19 outbreak, with a high prevalence of sleep disturbances in particular. Relevant factors included presence or absence in Wuhan during the outbreak closure, gender, work or absence, and fear of hospital visits.

This study aimed to assess factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs six months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at a tertiary hospital, in Lebanon between June and July 2020. The survey included data on demographics, exposure to COVID-19, preparedness to COVID-19 outbreak, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and mental health dimensions. Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests were used to understand the association among these variables. One hundred and ninety-three of 1,600 Lebanese HCWs participated. More than 80% reported high preparedness levels towards the COVID-19 outbreak, 69% believed that their job was putting them at risk, and 70% altruistically accepted these risks. Anxiety and depression symptomatology were present in 24% and 23% of HCWs; who were more likely to feel more stress at work (83% vs 60%; p = 0.004; 82% vs 61%; p = 0.01, respectively), feel afraid of falling ill (72% vs 55%; p = 0.03; 77% vs 54%; p = 0.01, respectively), fear death (21% vs 7%; p = 0.01; 25% vs 6%; p ≤ 0.001, respectively), and believed that people avoided their families (39% vs 21%; p = 0.01; 35% vs 65%; p = 0.02, respectively). HCWs who reported signs of depression were less likely to altruistically accept the risks of caring for COVID-19 patients, compared to those who did not (57% vs 74%; p = 0.03). This study aimed to detect factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggested that altruistic acceptance of COVID-19 risks is higher among HCWs with positive exposure history to COVID-19 and those with less depressive symptomatology.",2021.0,2021-01-01,15,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001bf31f127204b8452d6790126390bb4b60c876

Recombinant protein vaccines play a crucial role in providing broad immuno-protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of ReCOV as a booster dose in two randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In Study-1, adults who had received two or three doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine were randomized (1:1:1) to receive 20 μg ReCOV, 40 μg ReCOV, or an inactivated vaccine (COVILO®) in the United Arab Emirates. Study-2 involved subjects who received two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine and were randomized (1:1:1) to receive 20 μg ReCOV (pilot batch, ReCOV HA), 20 μg ReCOV (commercial batch, ReCOV TC), or 30 μg BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY®) in the Philippines. The primary immunogenicity objectives were to compare geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion rate (SCR) of live-virus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 prototype induced by one booster dose of ReCOV with that of inactivated vaccine and BNT162b2, respectively, at 14 days post-booster.


RESULTS
Heterologous booster doses of ReCOV were safe, well-tolerated, and elicited noninferior immunogenic responses to inactivated vaccines and BNT162b2 against both Omicron variants and prototype in previously vaccinated adults. The results demonstrated significant advantages in cross-neutralization activities against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, surpassing those observed with inactivated vaccines and BNT162b2. Additionally, good immune persistence was noted.


CONCLUSIONS
Heterologous boosting with ReCOV proved safe and effective, with promising results in managing the COVID-19 epidemic. The study sheds light on the high potential of ReCOV in providing enhanced protection, supported by strong cross-neutralization activities and immune persistence.

10.52976/vansaglik.1354802,Nephrological Problems in COVID19 Patients: A Retrospective Single Centre Study,"Aim: The SARS CoV-2 virus that emerged in 2019 and the emerging pandemic are full of journeys. The nephrological effects of the pandemic have been a matter of curiosity. In this study, nephrological problems were investigated in COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized in clinical and intensive care units. 
Materials and Methods: The research is an observational cross-sectional retrospective study. Between November 2020 and November 2021, blood and urine analyzes sent from patients aged 18-90 who were followed up in the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit and COVID-19 clinics were examined. 79 patients were included in the study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made by considering RT-PCR, thorax CT and clinical situation. These 79 patients were compared in terms of acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte imbalance and complete urinalysis disorders. 
Results: AKI was detected in 32.9% of patients. 42.3% of patients with AKI were female, 57.7% were male. 73.1% of the patients with AKI were hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Hematuria and proteinuria were detected in 65% and 27%, respectively. In the examinations performed, 65% hematuria, 27% proteinuria, 44% hyponatremia, 4% hypernatremia, 13% hypokalemia, 11% hyperkalemia, 11% hypophosphatemia, 6% hyperphosphatemia, 9% hypomagnesemia, 3% hypermagnesemia, 24% hypocalcemia and 65% hypoalbuminemia were detected. 
Conclusion: Acute kidney injury, hematuria and proteinuria were statistically significant in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized and followed up. There are also electrolyte imbalances and hypoalbuminemia in patients.

10.52380/ijpes.2023.10.1.967,Sudden Transition to Online Instruction for ESL Instructors: A Phenomenological Study,"


In March of 2020, educational institutions worldwide experienced mass school closures mandated to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as part of public health efforts. Millions of educators and students around the world began to teach and study through distance education. In order to deliver high-quality instruction, educators were required to adapt to remote teaching tools and methodologies in a short amount of time. The majority of college instructors who teach remotely at community colleges had not received training prior to the online teaching transition. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the lived experiences of 15 English as a second language (ESL) instructors who taught at a community college in the northeast section of the United States during and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic. During the data analysis, critical themes such as strong emotional reactions, technological difficulties, increased workload and exhaustion, teacher-formed learning communities, and learning by trial and error emerged. The contribution of this phenomenological study may benefit higher education administrators and instructors by helping them make informed decisions in case of a sudden transition. The data derived from this study might serve as a guide to schools in similar settings. This information could be shared in workshops and seminars to equip faculty as well as prepare future faculty and staff members. As a result of the study, educational institutions can evaluate their practices to increase the faculty's readiness to teach remotely under emergency conditions.

10.1371/journal.pone.0261849,Diagnosis of tuberculosis among COVID-19 suspected cases in Ghana,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 pandemics are both diseases of public health threat globally. Both diseases are caused by pathogens that infect mainly the respiratory system, and are involved in airborne transmission; they also share some clinical signs and symptoms. We, therefore, took advantage of collected sputum samples at the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in Ghana to conduct differential diagnoses of long-standing endemic respiratory illness, particularly tuberculosis. Methodology Sputum samples collected through the enhanced national surveys from suspected COVID-19 patients and contact tracing cases were analyzed for TB. The sputum samples were processed using Cepheid’s GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay in pools of 4 samples to determine the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Positive pools were then decoupled and analyzed individually. Details of positive TB samples were forwarded to the NTP for appropriate case management. Results Seven-hundred and seventy-four sputum samples were analyzed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in both suspected COVID-19 cases (679/774, 87.7%) and their contacts (95/774, 12.3%). A total of 111 (14.3%) were diagnosed with SARS CoV-2 infection and six (0.8%) out of the 774 individuals tested positive for pulmonary tuberculosis: five (83.3%) males and one female (16.7%). Drug susceptibility analysis identified 1 (16.7%) rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis case. Out of the six TB positive cases, 2 (33.3%) tested positive for COVID-19 indicating a coinfection. Stratifying by demography, three out of the six (50%) were from the Ayawaso West District. All positive cases received appropriate treatment at the respective sub-district according to the national guidelines. Conclusion Our findings highlight the need for differential diagnosis among COVID-19 suspected cases and regular active TB surveillance in TB endemic settings.",2021.0,2021-12-28,8,20,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d9fa51696a513888a8ed005e40a3b50e8401e
10.1101/2020.12.04.412494,The aging whole blood transcriptome reveals a potential role of FASLG in COVID-19,"The risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age as older patients are at the highest risk. Although it is still unclear whether the virus is blood-transmitted, the viral RNA is detected in serum. Identifying how Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interacts with specific blood components during aging is expected to guide proper therapies. Considering that all human coronavirus require host cellular molecules to promote infection, we investigated the aging whole blood transcriptome from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to explore differentially expressed genes (DEGs) translated into proteins potentially interacting with viral proteins. From a total of 22 DEGs in aged blood, five genes (FASLG, CTSW, CTSE, VCAM1, and BAG3) changed expression during aging. These age-related genes are involved in immune response, inflammation, cell component and cell adhesion, and platelet activation/aggregation. Both males and females older than 50 overexpress FASLG compared with younger adults (20-30 years old), possibly inducing a hyper-inflammatory cascade that activates specific immune cells. Furthermore, the expression of cathepsins (CTSW and CTSE) and the anti-apoptotic co-chaperone molecule BAG3 was significantly increased throughout aging in both gender. By exploring publicly available Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data on peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, we found FASLG and CTSW expressed mainly in natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T lymphocytes whereas BAG3 was expressed in CD4+ T cells, naive T cells, and CD14+ monocytes. The increased expression of FASLG in blood during aging may explain why older patients are more prone to severe acute viral infection complications. These results indicate FASLG as a prognostic candidate and potential therapeutic target for more aggressive clinical manifestation of COVID-19.",2020.0,2020-12-06,3,71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001df15db992aca32e92c201b78283a48b5d97e1

METODOLOGIA: Trata-se de uma revisão integrativa da literatura que utilizou os bancos de dados eletrônicos Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS), National Library of Medicine (PubMed) e Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO). Sendo selecionados artigos publicados nos últimos 06 anos, de forma gratuita ou não, disponíveis nos idiomas português, inglês ou espanhol; e foram excluídos resumos, teses e artigos que não condizem com a temática abortada. Os descritores utilizados para pesquisa serão: ´´Síndrome de Guillain-barré``, ´´COVID-19``, ´´Vacinas contra COVID-19`` e ´´Pandemia``, quando pesquisados de forma agrupada, usando o descritor booleano AND. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÕES: A causa específica dessa afecção ainda é desconhecida, porém, as explicações reconhecidas atualmente incluem o mimetismo molecular e os mecanismos imunomediados, como a formação de anticorpos antigangliosídeos e a ativação do complemento. Ainda mais, boa parte dos casos dessa patologia ocorre após um episódio infeccioso, assim, hoje, existem vários relatos após a infecção por COVID-19. Como essa patologia já foi associada a outros imunizantes é prudente observar os possíveis efeitos colaterais da vacina COVID-19, pois a coocorrência de GBS após essa vacina já foi descrita, recentemente. No entanto, ainda não foi feito um estudo epidemiológico a fim de investigar essa associação. CONCLUSÃO: Portanto, a SGB, uma doença autoimune associada ao vírus desde a pandemia, ataca o sistema nervoso periférico, especialmente a bainha de mielina, como resposta secundária à falha imunológica pós-infecção.

10.2196/59372,"A Digital Mental Health Solution to Improve Social, Emotional, and Learning Skills for Youth: Protocol for an Efficacy and Usability Study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a devastating youth mental health crisis in the United States, characterized by an all-time high prevalence of youth mental illness. This crisis is exacerbated by limited access to mental health services and the reduction of mental health support in schools. Mobile health platforms offer a promising avenue for delivering tailored and on-demand mental health care. Objective To address the lack of youth mental health services, we created the Science Technology Engineering Math and Social and Emotional Learning (STEMSEL) study. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of a digital mental health intervention, Neolth, in enhancing social and emotional well-being, reducing academic stress, and increasing mental health literacy and life skills among adolescents. Methods The STEMSEL study will involve the implementation and evaluation of Neolth across 4 distinct phases. In phase 1, a comprehensive needs assessment will be conducted across 3 diverse schools, each using a range of teaching methods, including in-person, digital, and hybrid modalities. Following this, in phase 2, school administrators and teachers undergo intensive training sessions on Neolth’s functionalities and intervention processes as well as understand barriers and facilitators of implementing a digital mental health program at their respective schools. Phase 3 involves recruiting middle and high school students aged 11-18 years from the participating schools, with parental consent and student assent obtained, to access Neolth. Students will then be prompted to complete an intake questionnaire, enabling the customization of available modules to address their specific needs. Finally, phase 4 will include a year-long pre- and posttest pilot study to rigorously evaluate the usability and effectiveness of Neolth in addressing the mental health concerns of students across the selected schools. Results Phase 1 was successfully completed in August 2022, revealing significant deficits in mental health resources within the participating schools. The needs assessment identified critical gaps in available mental health support services. We are currently recruiting a diverse group of middle and high school students to participate in the study. The study’s completion is scheduled for 2024, with data expected to provide insights into the real-world use of Neolth among the adolescent population. It is designed to deliver findings regarding the intervention’s efficacy in addressing the mental health needs of students. Conclusions The STEMSEL study plays a crucial role in assessing the feasibility and adoption of digital mental health interventions within the school-aged youth population in the United States. The findings generated from this study have the potential to dismantle obstacles to accessing mental health assistance and broaden the availability of care through evidence-based strategies.

10.1093/ofid/ofad500.2002,"2382. Sociodemographic and Occupational Characteristics Associated with Delayed and Low COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake Among Healthcare Personnel: Monroe County, NY","Abstract Background Healthcare personnel (HCP) have remained at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. High and timely COVID-19 vaccine uptake is crucial to protect this at-risk population. Our study aims to characterize HCP who delayed initiation of the primary series, and those who did not receive a booster dose. Methods Data for this analysis came from a cohort of HCP working at a large healthcare system in Monroe County, NY identified between 12/28/2020-12/01/2022. HCP were enrolled as part of the CDC Emerging Infections Program COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness study using a test-negative case-control design. Participants completed a standardized questionnaire assessing demographic and occupational characteristics. Verified COVID-19 vaccination history for each HCP was collected during the study period. HCP were categorized as having early or delayed vaccine initiation if they received their 1st mRNA COVID-19 vaccine between 12/14/2020-03/30/2021 (early) or 04/01/2021-09/28/2021 (delayed) after which employee vaccine mandates were implemented at this hospital system. HCP were also categorized as having received a 3rd mRNA COVID-19 booster dose or not after 09/24/2021. Logistic regression models were run to identify characteristics of HCP who delayed 1st dose receipt or did not receive a booster dose. Results Across the study period, 3,471 HCP were enrolled. Of these, 86.0% had early initiation of their 1st mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and 82.8% received an mRNA booster dose. Low education, low household income, younger age (< 50), non-White race and public health insurance were all significant predictors of delayed receipt of 1st dose and lack of uptake of a booster. However, advanced professional role was only found to be a significant predictor of early 1st dose receipt (Figure 1). Sensitivity analyses, run by changing dates of early vs delayed initiation to later time points, validated these results.Figure 1. Sociodemographic and Occupational Characteristics Associated with COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage Among Healthcare Personnel (N=3,471) +Adjusted for gender, race/ethnicity, and education. ++Adjusted for gender and race/ethnicity. *Adjusted for professional role, educational attainment, and race/ethnicity. **Adjusted for gender, age, educational attainment, professional role, annual household income, and health insurance type. Other Role with Moderate or Minimal Patient Contact includes: Nonphysician behavioral health provider, chaplain, care coordinator, dietician, environmental services personnel, food services personnel, patient transport personnel, research personnel, social worker, student, facilitates maintenance personnel, medical equipment technician, laboratory personnel or pharmacist. Other Role with Substantial Patient Contact includes: Dental healthcare provider, emergency medical services personnel, occupational therapist, physical therapist or assistant, phlebotomist, respiratory therapist, radiology technician, speech-language pathologist, and surgical, medical or emergency technician. Conclusion Sociodemographic characteristics, rather than occupational, were predictive of high and timely vaccine uptake.

The measurement campaign ran at Marylebone Road (roadside) and Honor Oak Park (background) urban monitoring sites over a 12-month period between 1 September 2019 and 31 August 2020. The measurement data were used to determine the traffic increment (roadside–background) and covered a range of meteorological conditions, seasons, and driving styles, as well as the influence of the COVID-19 “lockdown” on non-exhaust concentrations. Non-exhaust particulate matter (PM)10 concentrations were calculated using chemical tracer scaling factors for brake wear (barium), tyre wear (zinc), and resuspension (silicon) and as average vehicle fleet non-exhaust emission factors, using a CO2 “dilution approach”. The effect of lockdown, which saw a 32% reduction in traffic volume and a 15% increase in average speed on Marylebone Road, resulted in lower PM10 and PM2.5 traffic increments and brake wear concentrations but similar tyre and resuspension concentrations, confirming that factors that determine non-exhaust emissions are complex. Brake wear was found to be the highest average non-exhaust emission source. In addition, results indicate that non-exhaust emission factors were dependent upon speed and road surface wetness conditions. Further statistical analysis incorporating a wider variability in vehicle mix, speeds, and meteorological conditions, as well as advanced source apportionment of the PM measurement data, were undertaken to enhance our understanding of these important vehicle sources.",2021.0,2021-01-31,43,73,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0020c8ada01affc6a3d6a9e5d2838f4342c93a63

It is mandatory to attain and maintain good nutritional status to fight against virus. Nutritional status of individual is affected by several factors such as age, sex, health status, life style and medications. Nutritional status of individuals has been used as resilience towards destabilization during this COVID-19 pandemic. Optimal nutrition and dietary nutrient intake impact the immune system, therefore the only sustainable way to survive in current context is to strengthen the immune system. There is no evidence found that supplement can cure the immune system except Vit C, which is one of the best way to improve immune system. A proper diet can ensure that the body is in proper state to defeat the virus. However along with the dietary management guidelines the food safety management and good food practices is compulsory.

10.9734/jpri/2021/v33i59a34292,A Cross Sectional analysis on the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Plastic Surgery among Plastic Surgeons in India,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the amount of elective procedures dramatically. We, as healthcare workers, are at grave danger of contracting COVID-19. It is consequently critical for plastic surgeons to maintain their safety while attempting to resume routine activities as soon as possible. The goal of this research is to learn more about plastic surgery practises during the COVID-19 pandemic. We plan to serve as many people as possible while conserving medical resources for future crises. 
Objective: To study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on plastic surgery among plastic surgeons in India 
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out using a questionnaire. The study population is made up of plastic surgeons, and the study location was chosen from several hospitals in India. The study duration was 6 months. Data was obtained using the snowball sampling method using a pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire with 27 questions. The data was entered into an excel spreadsheet and analysed with SPSS version 16 software, with Fisher's exact test used for statistical analysis. 
Results: A total of 61 participants were included in the study. The majority (60.7%) do not work in COVID-19 care in their hospital but the majority of the participants who took part in this study work in a hospital which is recognised as a COVID-19 centre for treatment (65.6%). 31 participants in their working hospitals there are more than 100 COVID-19 patients are being treated currently in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and covid ward (50.8%) and but majority of the participants do not work in COVID-19 centre (60.7%). The Association between centres having separate wards for COVID and non-COVID patients and whether plastic surgeons working in COVID-19 centre on applying fisher’s exact test the p-value was found to be 0.215. The Association between centres having separate wards for COVID and non-COVID patients and practicing microsurgery during this pandemic on applying Fisher’s exact test the p-value was found to be 0.884. The Association between screening patients for COVID during emergency and group of patients operated without waiting for COVID report during emergency on applying Fisher’s exact test the p-value was found to be 0.408 
Conclusion: The current study demonstrates how the COVID-19 epidemic has affected the plastic surgery department and imposed restrictions. Plastic surgeons should be kept up to speed and informed on the latest information and techniques for treating this problem, as well as infection prevention and control.

E-learning has surfaced in most countries as an alternative way to continue educational programs. This study aimed to determine the degree of satisfaction and perceived barriers among college students with E-learning. Methods Students of two Iraqi universities studying through an online platform participated in this cross-sectional study. An online survey questionnaire was used to assess student perceptions of the level of satisfaction with and barriers to E-learning. Participants' non-identifying demographics were also collected. Results The majority of students (70.9%) were females, and more than half (57.9%) were from the Faculty of Science. About 64.8% of the students were not satisfied with the E-learning experience. Only 35.5% of the students attended synchronous electronic classes while the rest used asynchronous learning activities. Students’ level of satisfaction was poor, as only 6.4% of students strongly believed that tutoring was informative and that technology and educational technology were adequate. On the contrary, 69% of students strongly agreed that E-learning saved them time and money. Barriers that were perceived by the student were slow internet speed, power interruption, and the lack of face-to-face interaction.

Materials and Methods: Six experienced laryngologists performed laryngoscopic examinations in 30 patients in a closed-chamber examination unit. The physicians and patients were asked to compare all domains with their previous standard laryngoscopic examination experience using a 10-point visual analog scale (0, poor performance; 10, good performance), including effectiveness of communication, difficulty of examination, perception of safety against airborne transmission of COVID-19, applicability of the unit for future examinations, perception of protective environment, and overall comfort. Results: All laryngoscopic examinations were performed successfully. Effectiveness of communication, difficulty of examination, perception of protective environment, and overall comfort did not differ between physicians and patients (P > .05 for all comparisons). However, both physicians and patients found the examination to be difficult. While physicians evaluated the system as safe against airborne transmission of COVID-19, patients were not confident that the system was safe (8.70 ± 1.93 vs 2.87 ± 2.37, respectively, P = .001). Physicians also gave a higher score to future applicability of the unit for examinations than patients (8.90 ± 1.42 vs 7.10 ± 2.62, respectively, P = .001).

The regions of the Russian Federation differ in fertility, mortality and dynamics of medical demographic indices. These differences are to be considered for improvements the demographic situation in the country. Aim. The aim of the study is analyzing regional features of the development of the medical and demographic situation for 2006-2020 in the Republic of Tatarstan. Material and methods. This research was conducted based on организация здраВоохранения96 Вестник соВременной клинической медицины 2023 том 16, вып. 1 Введение. Согласно Концепции демографи- ческой политики Российской Федерации (РФ) на период до 2025 года определены задачи по ста- билизации численности населения, созданию усло- вий для ее роста, сокращению уровня смертности, а также повышению качества жизни и увеличению ожидаемой продолжительности жизни. Одной из национальных целей развития РФ на период до 2024 года является повышение ожидаемой продол- жительности жизни до 78 лет, к 2030 г. до 80 лет. Улучшение демографической ситуации, развитие позитивных тенденций в стране возможно лишь при учете всего многообразия процессов воспроиз- водства населения в российских регионах, а они от- личаются по уровню рождаемости и смертности, по характеру миграции и демографической динамики в целом [1, 2], что и определило актуальность темы настоящего исследования. Цель работы: анализ региональных особеннос- тей развития медико-демографической ситуации за 2016-2020 гг. в Республике Татарстан (РТ). Материал и методы исследования: иссле- дование проводилось по данным статистических отчетных форм Республиканского медицинского информационно-аналитического центра, Террито- риального органа Федеральной службы государс- твенной статистики по РТ за 2016–2020 гг. Прове- ден сравнительный анализ численности населения и показателей смертности в половозрастном и но- зологическом разрезах (по классам МКБ-10) с ис- пользованием методов описательной статистики (средние величины (М), среднеквадратичное откло- нение (s), темп прироста (убыли), среднегодовой темп прироста (убыли)), линейного регрессионно- го анализа. Оценка достоверности различий про- водилась с использованием критерия Стьюдента (t), критерия Манна-Уитни (U). При статистической обработке данных применена программа Microsoft Excel 2017. Протокол исследования был одобрен локальным этическим комитетом центра. Результаты и обсуждение. Достижения про- филактической и клинической медицины привели к постепенному снижению общего коэффициента смертности населения. В результате, несмотря на снижение уровня рождаемости, до 2019 г., в отли- чие от РФ в целом и территорий, входящих в ПФО, естественный прирост в республике имел положи- тельные значения (табл. 1). В связи с пандемией COVID-19 в 2020 г. резко выросла смертность на- селения. Общий коэффициент смертности в РТ со- ставил 13,9 на 1000 жителей, что является самым низким значением в Приволжском Федеральном Округе (ПФО), где в среднем величина данного по- казателя составила 15,9, в РФ – 14,6 на 1000 жи- телей. Продолжили снижение показатели рождае- мости, обусловленные прежде всего тенденцией уменьшения доли женщин активного репродуктив- ного возраста. В результате естественная убыль the official statistical reporting forms from 2016 to 2020 using descriptive statistical methods. Results and discussion. In the general structure of the republic population over the studied period, the proportion of elderly people has increased by 0.61%, children - by 1.01%, while the share of the working-age population has decreased by 1.58%. Mortality rates for men of working age are on average 4 times higher than for women. The greatest difference in indicators is noted for such reasons as injuries and poisoning (6 times), diseases of the blood system (5.3 times), respiratory diseases (4 times). The highest rate of increase in mortality among people of retirement age for the period 2016-2020 are observed due to diseases of the respiratory system and the endocrine system. The overall increase in mortality in men was 72.8% and 81.5%, in women - 146.4% and 81.1%, respectively, the highest increase in mortality was observed in 2020 due to the spread of COVID-19. Conclusion. The analysis carried out testifies to the tendencies formed in the Republic of Tatarstan in reducing the number of working-age population, birth rates, in the background of an increase in mortality. Due to the spread of COVID-19 in 2020, there was a sharp increase in the death rate of the working-age and retirement age population.

10.1093/ofid/ofae243,Viral SARS-CoV-2 Rebound Rates in Linked Commercial Pharmacy-Based Testing and Health Care Claims,"Abstract Background Viral SARS-CoV-2 rebound (viral RNA rebound) is challenging to characterize in large cohorts due to the logistics of collecting frequent and regular diagnostic test results. Pharmacy-based testing data provide an opportunity to study the phenomenon in a large population, also enabling subgroup analyses. The current real-world evidence approach complements approaches focused on smaller, prospective study designs. Methods We linked real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction test data from national pharmacy-based testing to health care claims data via tokenization to calculate the cumulative incidence of viral RNA rebound within 28 days following positive test results in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV-r)–treated and untreated individuals during the Omicron era (December 2021–November 2022) and prior to the Omicron era (October 2020–November 2021). Results Among 30 646 patients, the rate of viral RNA rebound was 3.5% (95% CI, 2.0%–5.7%) in NMV-r–treated infections as compared with 1.5% (95% CI, 1.3%–1.7%) in untreated infections during the Omicron era and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.7%–2.1%) prior to the Omicron era. Viral RNA rebound in patients who were vaccinated (n = 8151), high risk (n = 4411), or older (≥65 years, n = 4411) occurred at comparable rates to the overall cohort (range, 1.1%–4.8%). Viral rebounds to high RNA levels in NMV-r–treated infections occurred in 8% of viral rebounds as compared with 5% to 11% in untreated infections. Rates of hospitalization were comparable between patients with NMV-r–treated infections with viral RNA rebound (0%) and untreated patients with viral RNA rebound (0%–1.2%). Conclusions Our findings suggest viral RNA rebound is rare (< 5%), with rates that were consistent with those from the EPIC-HR trial (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients). Most occurrences of viral RNA rebound were associated with low viral RNA levels, and viral RNA rebound progression to severe disease was not observed.",2024.0,2024-05-02,0,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0023e7dd9a6b06423c1d45d0f5d586b5880332da

Material and Methods: Patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups based on whether their RT-PCR test resulted in a positive or negative result. MPVLR, MPVPR, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, MPV and RDW levels were compared between these two groups. In addition, the changes in MPVLR, MPVPR, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, MPV, and RDW levels before and after treatment were compared in the whole patient population.
Results: There were 113 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a positive PCR test and 79 patients with a negative PCR test. Before treatment, the MPVLR level was 7.2±0.85 in the PCR test positive group and 5.4±0.29 in the PCR test negative group (p=0.04). Post-treatment MPVLR levels were 5.7±0.4 and 4.9±0.26 in the PCR positive and negative groups, respectively (p=0.09). The MPVPR level before treatment was 0.046±0.002 in the PCR test positive group and 0.035±0.001 in the PCR test negative group (p=0.003). After treatment, the MPVPR level was 0.040±0.002 in the PCR-positive group and 0.032±0.001 in the PCR-negative group (p=0.023)
Conclusion: This study is the first to demonstrate high MPVLR and MPVPR in PCR-positive COVID-19 patients. Patients with negative PCR test and high MPVLR and MPVPR should be evaluated with radiological and clinical symptoms.",2023.0,2023-02-18,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00240b8d6dbe6432c616dc73219453ff90a426e5

10.2196/47677,Sharing Reliable COVID-19 Information and Countering Misinformation: In-Depth Interviews With Information Advocates,"Background The rampant spread of misinformation about COVID-19 has been linked to a lower uptake of preventive behaviors such as vaccination. Some individuals, however, have been able to resist believing in COVID-19 misinformation. Further, some have acted as information advocates, spreading accurate information and combating misinformation about the pandemic. Objective This work explores highly knowledgeable information advocates’ perspectives, behaviors, and information-related practices. Methods To identify participants for this study, we used outcomes of survey research of a national sample of 1498 adults to find individuals who scored a perfect or near-perfect score on COVID-19 knowledge questions and who also self-reported actively sharing or responding to news information within the past week. Among this subsample, we selected a diverse sample of 25 individuals to participate in a 1-time, phone-based, semistructured interview. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the team conducted an inductive thematic analysis. Results Participants reported trusting in science, data-driven sources, public health, medical experts, and organizations. They had mixed levels of trust in various social media sites to find reliable health information, noting distrust in particular sites such as Facebook (Meta Platforms) and more trust in specific accounts on Twitter (X Corp) and Reddit (Advance Publications). They reported relying on multiple sources of information to find facts instead of depending on their intuition and emotions to inform their perspectives about COVID-19. Participants determined the credibility of information by cross-referencing it, identifying information sources and their potential biases, clarifying information they were unclear about with health care providers, and using fact-checking sites to verify information. Most participants reported ignoring misinformation. Others, however, responded to misinformation by flagging, reporting, and responding to it on social media sites. Some described feeling more comfortable responding to misinformation in person than online. Participants’ responses to misinformation posted on the internet depended on various factors, including their relationship to the individual posting the misinformation, their level of outrage in response to it, and how dangerous they perceived it could be if others acted on such information. Conclusions This research illustrates how well-informed US adults assess the credibility of COVID-19 information, how they share it, and how they respond to misinformation. It illustrates web-based and offline information practices and describes how the role of interpersonal relationships contributes to their preferences for acting on such information. Implications of our findings could help inform future training in health information literacy, interpersonal information advocacy, and organizational information advocacy. It is critical to continue working to share reliable health information and debunk misinformation, particularly since this information informs health behaviors.",2023.0,2023-03-28,2,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002559cc9c1b9168fe9fead1be9510eb1e5e80d4

Changes in the practice of bronchoscopy post pandemic: A perspective,"From the first bronchoscopy in 1897, interventional pulmonologists (IP) have developed innovative technologies to improve diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes, revolutionizing the field of thoracic medicine.[2] Techniques and procedural preparation have also evolved to improve safety and minimize the risk of disease transmission. While the practice of interventional pulmonology continues to advance, the current COVID‐19 pandemic demands a conscientious, differential approach to any invasive or aerosol‐generating procedure. Studies have demonstrated that currently 6% of the total health‐care workforce has been infected by COVID‐19.[3] Emerging evidence suggests an airborne mode of transmission for COVID‐19, making the performance of bronchoscopy a high‐risk procedure.[4] In addition, the transmission of multidrug‐resistant microorganisms via bronchoscopy has necessitated the re‐defining of instrument decontamination, strict infection control policies, and prudent use of this revolutionary tool.[5] These critical challenges evoke core questions regarding the future of interventional pulmonology and the long‐lasting impact the pandemic may have on the practice of bronchoscopy.",2021.0,2021-07-01,0,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0025c2c682625f00cedaa20a189a552e1d89f463
10.1093/eurpub/ckac129.160,A community-based participatory approach to engaging Congolese migrants in intervention co-design,"Abstract Issue The World Health Organization has called for tailored, community-based interventions to address disparities in vaccination uptake affecting migrant and minoritised populations, however few exist. This study directly responds to global calls for community-centred and participatory approaches to engaging migrants in routine and COVID-19 vaccination. Problem description Black and African migrants are known to be at risk of under-immunisation and have lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake rates in high-income countries. This UK study will use community-based participatory approaches to engage Congolese migrants in co-developing a tailored intervention to increase vaccine uptake. A community-academic coalition will lead the study. Community members will be trained as peer researchers and financially compensated. The final output will be an intervention strategy tailored to and embedded within the Congolese migrant community. Preliminary results The coalition held 20 hours of planning meetings and peer researcher training in 2021 and co-developed a phased study involving 1) community days with poster walls and qualitative in-depth interviews with Congolese migrants, 2) interviews and workshops with local stakeholders, and 3) co-design workshops with Congolese migrants. Following outreach and pre-engagement, approximately 80 migrants attended the community days, with more than 50 interviews and 100% left positive feedback (including: felt valued, welcomed, Congolese language recognised). Lessons Community-academic partnerships are resource-intensive but can be an effective means to build and maintain trust required to deliver a community-based research study. Academic partners should support community partners in understanding the research process to help manage expectations and provide financial compensation for their time and effort. This study offers an innovative engagement model and study design that can be adapted to other underserved populations. Key messages • Global policy-setting organisations have called urgently for participatory research that engages migrants in the co-production of tailored initiatives to address vaccination inequalities. • This study uses a novel, theory-driven, participatory approach to engage with and identify barriers to vaccination in Congolese migrants and co-design a tailored strategy to increase uptake.",2022.0,2022-10-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0025de8d2f97c163310ce3dc3fcafb373db77e43

Investigating the epidemiology of different clinical manifestations of this disease in patients referred to medical centers is one of the most effective steps in adopting a suitable diagnostic and treatment approach. These findings also provide a basis for comparing the evolution of the virus and its clinical manifestations over time and at different peaks of the disease. Therefore, the present study was aimed at investigating common clinical findings at the time of referral in patients with COVID-19 in Afzalipour Hospital, Kerman, during the first peak of the disease. This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was performed on hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19, between March 2020 and June 2020. The patients were included in the study by census method, and the research variables related to demographic indicators, disease course and clinical symptoms were extracted from the patients' medical records, and then subjected to statistical analysis. In this study, a total of 210 patients were examined, consisted mainly of male patients (59.5%). The mean age was found to be 53.95 ± 19.55 years. Also, 20.3% of patients needed admission in the intensive care unit. In addition, 1% of patients were infected in February 2020, 24% in March 2020, 47.4% in April 2020 and 27.4% in May 2020. The mean onset of symptoms until hospitalization was also found as 6.51 days. The most common clinical symptoms included shortness of breath (75.7%), dry cough (52.9%), fever (50.5%), myalgia (45.7%) and fatigue (41.9%). Fever at admission time was significantly more common in ages less than 50 years (p=0.034). Our study showed that the most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath, dry cough, fever, myalgia and fatigue. No statistically significant difference was found in common symptoms between men and women. Among the common clinical symptoms, only fever at admission time was observed to be significantly higher in those under 50 years of age.",2022.0,2022-08-12,4,64,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0026559c8da10c5b0769ec51f2eed303d490eadb

10.1093/geroni/igab046.3245,Effect of Video assisted Home-Based exercise intervention on fall risk and gait parameters in older adults in India,"Abstract Countries across the globe recommended isolation to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection. However, this led to decreased mobility and physical inactivity potentially increasing their risk of fall. The study was conducted in a group of 88 older adults between 60-74 years with known gait impairments and high fall risk. The participants were part of our cohort study on fall prevention program. Fall risk and gait impairments were measured using wearable sensors during the Timed-up and go test (TUG) at baseline. Using technology, a 16-week video assisted home based exercises intervention was delivered to reduce fall risk and improve gait parameters. The intervention consisted of flexibility, strengthening, balance and gait training exercises given progressively through one video session per week. The participants performed these exercises at home for the rest of the week. A home visit immediately after 16th week was arranged to collect post intervention parameters. Results showed an average 20% decrease in fall risk post intervention. An overall large effect size with Cohen’s d of 0.90 was reported for fall risk. Significant difference in TUG time (Z = -4.610, p< 0.000), stride velocity (Z= -5.035, p<0.000), stride length (Z = -5.867, p<0.000), time taken to stand (Z = -7.363, p<0.000) and time taken to turn (Z = -6.079, p<0.000) was observed in the post-test measurements as compared to pre-test measurements. Therefore, we conclude that video assisted exercise programs can be highly beneficial as alternatives to in person exercise intervention to prevent falls during COVID-19 isolation.",2021.0,2021-12-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0026b19949b9f3bcfa09716a2d478350864c0856

Still, senior teachers who have a significant impact on their advancement of professionalism with many years of teaching experience face several challenges in utilizing ICT in teaching and learning. Several studies found that compared to male teachers, female teachers are less proficient in using ICT devices due to several factors. Thus, this study aims to discover senior female EFL teachers' beliefs in terms of their perceptions and awareness of using ICT during their teaching and learning processes. The study included 34 senior female EFL teachers from East Java, Indonesia. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods design was used in this study. The questionnaires and one-on-one interviews showed that the use of ICT in the classroom is reported to be well appreciated by senior female EFL teachers, who also received guidance and support from their colleagues and collaborated on ICT professional development. However, they need assistance with theoretical and practical ICT abilities, solutions to internet constraints, and school-based technological infrastructures.

However, they can suffer from ongoing symptoms, generally referred to as long COVID. Sleep disorders are one of the most frequent complaints in long COVID although precise data are missing. We assessed the sleep behavior of children and adolescents who presented at our outpatient clinic between January 2021 and May 2022 with the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ-DE). We compared the sleep behavior at three different time points: pre-COVID-19; post-COVID-19 at the initial presentation; and post-COVID-19 at re-presentation. Data from 45 patients were analyzed. Of those, 64% were female and the median age was 10 years (range: 0–18 years). Asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease was experienced in 89% of patients; 11% experienced moderate disease. The initial presentation occurred at a median of 20.4 weeks (6 weeks–14 months) after the infection. The CSHQ-DE score increased significantly from pre-COVID-19 (45.82 ± 8.7 points) to post-COVID-19 (49.40 ± 8.3 points; p ≤ 0.01). The score then normalized at re-presentation (46.98 ± 7.8; p = 0.1). The greatest changes were seen in the CSHQ-DE subscale score “daytime sleepiness”. Our data showed that children and adolescents with long COVID often suffer from sleep disturbances. For most children and adolescents, these sleep disorders decreased over time without any further medical intervention aside from a basic sleep consultation.",2022.0,2022-09-01,9,69,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0026c6f4f2691f8967115a98199b771e4005f9e2

Governments all over the world have taken unprecedented steps to fight the pandemic through farreaching public health measures and widespread lockdowns as well as fiscal and monetary policies to restart their economies. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) defines young people as individuals between the ages of 10 and 24 years old: adolescents (aged 10–19) and youth (aged 15–24).* Young people felt the impact of the pandemic directly and immediately. With almost no notice, 1.6 billion young people in 188 countries were being kept away from school and universities due to physical distancing measures. They found themselves in the middle of an experiment in new ways of teaching and learning, or shut out of the education system altogether. Even as the pandemic entered its third year, 405 million schoolchildren in 23 countries continued to be affected by full or partial school closures. This large-scale interruption of learning has severe consequences – from compromising nutrition to limiting access to health care, raising school dropout rates, and depriving young people of social support and resources. It has also significantly impacted our ability to equip young people with the information and skills to make wellinformed decisions about their lives and bodies and develop healthy relationships via the provision of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE). Responding to adolescents’ and youth’s sexual and reproductive needs and rights during their transition towards adulthood is key in supporting evolving capacities to advance youth agency and empowerment. CSE equips young people with the foundation to make well-informed decisions about their lives and bodies and develop healthy relationships. Continuation of CSE delivery during a crisis such as the pandemic is critical to realise young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights. This commentary aims to examine the COVID19 disruptions to CSE programming, responses, and strategies from countries and organisations to overcome challenges caused by COVID restrictions, and to explore the potential for digital technologies to deliver information and education in new ways.",2023.0,2023-04-25,2,16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002712e410befb2577cc28ac853383ff29aba3e0

The current study aimed to assess the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines among adults in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study, including 365 randomly selected adult Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine recipients who received a homologous prime-boost vaccination between February 1st and June 30th, 2021. Data of height and weight were collected to assess the weight status of percipients. An evaluation of seropositivity for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results Among the participants, 69% (n = 250) reported at least one vaccine-related symptom. Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported vaccine-related symptom. The mean total score for vaccine-related symptoms was significantly higher among participants who received the AstraZeneca vaccine, women, and participants with no previous COVID-19 infection (p < 0.05). Spike-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 98.9% of participants after the receipt of two vaccine doses, including 99.5% of Pfizer vaccine recipients and 98.3% of AstraZeneca vaccine recipients. Significantly, higher proportions of participants in the <35-year age group developed a humoral immune response after the first vaccine dose compared with the participants in other age groups. Conclusion Participants who received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine reported fewer vaccine-related complications compared with those who received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, but no serious side effects were reported in response to either vaccine. Health status and age were factors that may influence COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness for the generation of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",2021.0,2021-12-01,28,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002732ecaa0d0e33e18ba70bf092ac5a27cfa994

New-norms of COVID-19 prevention although appear promising yet often adjunct with non-congruent compliance. The WHO has advocated house-to-house case-linked study to acquire facts on epidemiological and transmissibility traits of COVID-19 in low-income communities. Kolkata experienced the first wave of COVID-19 till November 20, expected second splatter in March 21.
Aims and Objectives: Thinking through a probable upswing of COVID-19 in Kolkata, it was felt prudent to study the occurrence of COVID-19 among residents of two different slums inter-alia study allied factors, if any.
Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in two different slums having 395 and 428 members, respectively, in South Kolkata from March 21 to August 21. Sanction was obtained from administrative authority as well from each individual. Questionnaire containing personal details, awareness, and observance of personal protective measures (PPM) on COVID-19 were sent to members through e-mode; those demurred, contacted in-person under new-norm. Data assembled was coded, tabulated and analyzed. Details of COVID-19 (RT-PCR+ve) cases confirmed by Government/private hospitals were incorporated as and when surfaced.
Results: Communities studied had comparable socio-demographic attributes including education, employment, and economic stand. About 93% of subjects from each slum knew most of the facets of PPM and stated practiced the same. Occurrence rates of COVID-19 were 15.2 and 16.2 per 1000 people of respective communities during study tenure. Majority of indisposed were smoker male (92%) from the lowest SES (53.8%), educated to primary/middle school (46%), and worked as vegetable seller (53.8%). All afflicted stated followed PPM except social distancing (77%) and sanitizer use (53.8%). All affected were smokers/quid-users and shared tobacco sticks/hand-smothered quid for mutual use regularly. The study unveiled unequivocal heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission in Kolkata slums because of certain unattended socio-graphics besides optimistic reflective of PPM awareness/observance. PPM proffers protection no doubt but its effective role necessitates consistent conformity in the background of certain contextual considerations.
Conclusion: Further research in urban slums is contemplated to enhance the present effort to extricate facts that may lend a hand in COVID-19 prevention tomorrow.",2021.0,2021-12-01,0,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0029195d5345f616e29459a5a977a0b374dfe285

10.1371/journal.pone.0282518,"Large and small financial incentives may motivate COVID-19 vaccination: A randomized, controlled survey experiment","Introduction Experts continue to debate how to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates. Some experts advocate for financial incentives. Others argue that financial incentives, especially large ones, will have counterproductive psychological effects, reducing the percent of people who want to vaccinate. Among a racially and ethnically diverse U.S. sample of lower income adults, for whom vaccine uptake has lagged compared with higher income adults, we empirically examine such claims about relatively large and small guaranteed cash payments. Methods In 2021, we conducted a randomized, controlled experiment among U.S. residents with incomes below $80,000 who reported being unvaccinated against COVID-19. Study participants were randomized to one of four study arms. In two arms, respondents first learned about a policy proposal to pay $1,000 or $200 to those who received COVID-19 vaccination and were then asked if, given that policy, they would want to vaccinate. In the two other arms, respondents received either an educational message about this vaccine or received no vaccine information and were then asked if they wanted to vaccinate for COVID-19. The primary analyses estimated and compared the overall percentage in each study arm that reported wanting to vaccinate for COVID-19. In other analyses, we estimated and compared these percentages for subgroups of interest, including gender, race/ethnicity, and education. Main results Among 2,290 unvaccinated adults, 79.7% (95%CI, 76.4–83.0%) of those who learned about the proposed $1,000 payment wanted to get vaccinated, compared with 58.9% (95%CI, 54.8–63.0%) in the control condition without vaccine information, a difference of 20 percentage points. Among those who learned of the proposed $200 payment, 74.8% (95% CI, 71.3–78.4%) wanted to vaccinate. Among those who learned only about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, 68.9% (95% CI, 65.1–72.7%) wanted to vaccinate. Findings were consistent across various subgroups. Discussion Despite several study limitations, the results do not support concerns that the financial incentive policies aimed to increase COVID-19 vaccination would have counterproductive effects. Instead, those who learned about a policy with a large or small financial incentive were more likely than those in the control condition to report that they would want to vaccinate. The positive effects extended to subgroups that have been less likely to vaccinate, including younger adults, those with less education, and racial and ethnic minorities. Financial incentives of $1,000 performed similarly to those offering only $200.",2023.0,2023-03-17,5,60,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002995a61f3b82c6510a05d1c0d03da82ae0c1a8

Imperative to exploring solutions faced by Covid pandemic challenges, various immediate steps were taken by medical schools globally including the faculty development activities transformed into online strategies. Workshops are the most common methods of the FDA to enhance knowledge and skills in specific areas of teaching and learning and assessment. A retrospective analysis of three of the TBL online FDA workshops is presented to determine its immediate impact on teaching and learning as well as an assessment model using pretest and posttest designs of a 3-point Likert scale of participants attending a half-day online workshop during the Covid19 pandemic for faculty development in a teaching hospital in Malaysia. Data was collected and analysed using online links created in Microsoft Google form at the beginning and towards the end of each workshop on a 3-point Likert scale of agreed, disagreed and not sure. A 15 items questionnaire was administered with additional information of participants’ trends in studying the reading materials sent out a week prior to the actual workshop. An interventional strategy between the two tests were four plenaries and a break-out session with hands-on group work followed by presentations. A collated quantitative data was gathered from 82 participants attending the online TBL workshops. Data were analysed using the statistical test of paired t-test, one-way ANOVA and ANCOVA with effect size in SPSS version 24. The percentage correct pretest and posttest score difference was significant at p = .013. The mean difference between pretest and posttest scores was significant at t = 31.345, p < 0.01. A significant difference in mean scores between groups was found, F (2,79) = 4.923, P = .010 using one-way ANOVA. Post-hoc analysis revealed significantly high posttest mean scores compared to partially read and not read groups at p = .033 and .014, respectively. However, the difference between partially read and not read was insignificant. A difference in mean posttest scores among the three groups using one-way ANCOVA on removing the effect of pretest was found significant at F (2, 80) = 6.211, p = 0.003.

10.1088/1748-9326/ac9703,PM2.5 exposures increased for the majority of Indians and a third of the global population during COVID-19 lockdowns: a residential biomass burning and environmental justice perspective,"In response to the emergence of COVID-19 during Spring 2020, many countries implemented nationwide lockdowns and mandatory stay-at-home orders, which resulted in historically clean ambient air quality. However, in many parts of the world, biomass burning for cooking is a common activity, and in India specifically, it has been implicated as the leading contributor to indoor and ambient PM2.5, and its activity was not stopped and likely increased during lockdowns. Here, we first estimate baseline and lockdown PM2.5 exposures specific to India using new, nationwide time-use survey data coupled with fine-scale PM2.5 estimates within various microenvironments. We then extend this framework to estimate the population globally that will have experienced higher PM2.5 exposures during lockdowns, due both to an increase in residential biomass burning activity as well as the entire day being spent in the more-polluted home environment for biomass fuel using households. Sixty five percent of Indians, the percent that uses biomass fuels for cooking, were exposed to higher PM2.5 levels during the lockdown compared to their modeled baseline exposures, with the average modeled exposure increasing by 13% (95% distribution: 8–26) (from 116 (82–157) to 131 (104–170) μg m−3). We further leverage this exposure framework to present India’s most comprehensive, to date, PM2.5 exposure disparity and environmental justice assessment; although women were still exposed to the highest levels of PM2.5 during the lockdown (from 135 (91–191) μg m−3 baseline to 147 (106–200) μg m−3 during the lockdown; 8.8% (5–18) increase), the demographic groups that experienced the highest exposure increases were working-age men and school-age children, whose average modeled exposures increased by 24% (18–48) (from 88 (63–118) to 108 (94–139) μg m−3) and 18% (8–31) (from 98 (75–134) to 115 (98–145) μg m−3), respectively. Globally, we conservatively estimate that 34.5% (21–51) of the global population observed increased PM2.5 exposures during COVID-19 lockdowns, concentrated in low-income regions with high biomass usage. There have been a number of clean-cooking initiatives introduced in India and throughout the world to replace biomass cookstoves, but the finding that PM2.5 exposures increased for the majority of Indians and a third of the global population—driven largely by residential biomass burning for cooking—during a period of historically clean ambient air quality, re-emphasizes the urgent need to further address clean cooking interventions to reduce PM2.5 exposures and in turn improve health outcomes.",2022.0,2022-10-03,0,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002a9c2f03149adaa5c7b7fce6be52dd0c70395e

10.2147/IJGM.S332458,"Effectiveness of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Favipiravir for COVID-19 Treatment: A Systematic Review","Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel strain that causes acute respiratory illnesses known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is limited information regarding the therapeutic management for this disease. Several studies have stated that antivirals drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir may potentially inhibit the virus from spreading to the host. Objective The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the clinical effectiveness and safety of remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir on COVID-19. Methods The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2021 to identify eligible experimental randomized controlled trials on remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 patients. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Results From 158 references, 15 studies were included in the review. The results showed that remdesivir has some potential benefits for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as seen from clinical improvements such as faster recovery time, less duration of hospitalization, and fewer respiratory side effects among COVID-19 patients. However, the impact of remdesivir in reducing mortality remains uncertain. Treatment with favipiravir has shown promising improvement in the clinical status of COVID-19 patients, although the results suggested no significant differences in some clinical parameters such as length of hospitalizations and clinical recovery. A combination of favipiravir with other supportive therapy showed more favorable outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients reported no significant clinical improvement compared to standard care with notable adverse effect reactions. Conclusion This study provides an overview of the evidence-based role of remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in the management of COVID-19. A thorough assessment of the benefit-risk profile in COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. The current review was based on very limited available data; therefore, further well-designed clinical trials are required.",2021.0,2021-11-01,36,64,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002bec48a2d73797a0db6bd973ecc96e17bacbe4
10.2340/jrm.v54.2203,REFERRALS TO EARLY SPECIALIZED REHABILITATION AFTER TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC,"Objective To quantify potential changes in direct referral to early specialized rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic and the injury pattern of patients hospitalized with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at a level 1 trauma centre. Methods In this registry-based study, data were retrieved from the Oslo TBI Registry-Neurosurgery and included adult patients with injury-related intracranial findings admitted to Oslo University Hospital (OUH). The study focused on a period of time when OUH was in any level of preparedness because of the COVID-19 pandemic; March 2020 to August 2021. For comparison, the study used patients hospitalized for TBI in 2018 and 2019. Results A total of 1,310 hospitalized patients with TBI were divided into 2 groups; pre-pandemic and pandemic. Direct referral to early rehabilitation was maintained. Patient volume remained stable, and there were no differences between the groups regarding patient characteristics and acute management, although there was a significantly higher proportion of TBIs secondary to electric scooter accidents in the pandemic group. Results from univariable and multivariable logistic regression showed a multifaceted reality, but younger age, none or mild pre-injury comorbidity and severe disability due to TBI at discharge from acute care remained stable strong predictors of direct referral to rehabilitation. Conclusion For patients with moderate-severe TBI, the direct pathway to early specialized rehabilitation was maintained during 2020–21. However, the pandemic continued and the long-term impact for rehabilitation services is not yet known. LAY ABSTRACT After traumatic brain injury, early rehabilitation is important in order to achieve optimal functional outcome. The COVID-19 pandemic has put the health services under pressure, and hospitals in Norway were reorganized to be able to treat a large number of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this study investigated to what extent the transfer to early rehabilitation has been affected and whether there have been changes in volume and characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with traumatic brain injury. In conclusion, the direct pathway to early rehabilitation was maintained during the pandemic years 2020 and 2021. Moreover, there was no change in the number of hospital admissions or patient characteristics, and acute management was maintained. However, the true long-term consequences for rehabilitation are not yet known.",2022.0,2022-09-09,3,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002c055471abe7ea02ece55dac5bed7f670249a1

10.1371/journal.pone.0305833,Mental health and the overall tendency to follow official recommendations against COVID-19: A U-shaped relationship?,"This paper investigates the association between several mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness) and the overall tendency to follow official recommendations regarding self-protection against COVID-19 (i.e., overall compliance). We employ panel data from the COME-HERE survey, collected over four waves, on 7,766 individuals (22,878 observations) from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Employing a flexible specification that allows the association to be non-monotonic, we find a U-shaped relationship, in which transitions to low and high levels of mental health are associated with higher overall compliance, while transitions to medium levels of mental health are associated with less overall compliance. Moreover, anxiety, stress, and loneliness levels at baseline (i.e., at wave 1) also have a U-shaped effect on overall compliance later (i.e., recommendations are followed best by those with lowest and highest levels of anxiety, stress, and loneliness at baseline, while following the recommendations is lowest for those with moderate levels of these variables). These U shapes, which are robust to several specifications, may explain some of the ambiguous results reported in the previous literature. Additionally, we observe a U-shaped association between the mental health indicators and a number of specific health behaviours (including washing hands and mask wearing). Importantly, most of these specific behaviours play a role in overall compliance. Finally, we uncover the role of gender composition effects in some of the results. While variations in depression and stress are negatively associated with variations in overall compliance for men, the association is positive for women. The U-shaped relation in the full sample (composed of males and females) will reflect first the negative slope for males and then the positive slope for females.",2024.0,2024-06-25,0,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002c711f9291555df850671ade71aeec2eb23d68

10.1111/jdv.19906,"Longitudinal analysis of the skin microbiome in association with hand eczema, hand hygiene practices and moisturizer use.","BACKGROUND
The skin microbiota maintains a physical and immunological barrier to the environment. Little is known about how the microbiome changes over time or the effect of hand hygiene practices and moisturizer use.


OBJECTIVES
To assess sex-specific changes in skin bacteria over time, and how the microbiome is related to self-reported hand eczema, hand hygiene practices and use of moisturizers.


METHODS
Swab samples from the dorsal hand were collected at baseline and 6.5 years later during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 168 participants from the RHINESSA study in Bergen, Norway. The skin samples were analysed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.


RESULTS
The alpha diversity of the hand microbiome increased from baseline to follow-up, and beta diversity differed by sex at both time points. The relative abundance increased for several bacteria from baseline to follow-up, with sex-specific differences. Current hand eczema and aggravating hand eczema during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with an increase in Staphylococcus. High hand washing frequency at home was associated with lower alpha diversity and with higher abundance of Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Finegoldia, and Pseudomonas and lower abundance of Propionibacterium and Pelomonas. The alpha diversity increased with increasing time passing between hand washing and sampling, whereas more frequent moisturizer use was associated with significantly lower alpha diversity, and a change in abundance for some bacteria, such as more Pseudomonas.


CONCLUSIONS
This longitudinal study revealed an overall increase in skin microbial diversity over a 6-year period, which was unexpected since follow-up was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic when vigorous hand hygienic practices were introduced. Sex-specific differences were identified at both time points. Individuals with hand eczema seem to develop a more dysbiotic skin bacterial community over time. Hand washing and use of moisturizers, with typically gender-specific habitual patterns, may lead to change in bacterial composition.",2024.0,2024-02-28,5,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002cda8706298b517353408293ce3f93f1d1855a

Hospitality education programs were not unique in their transition to online learning nor their incorporation of online instruction via learning management systems (LMS); there was, however, a pedagogical disconnect as hospitality and tourism education has historically been more task-oriented and centered on face-to-face interaction. This study aimed to identify Vietnamese hospitality and tourism students’ perceptions of their engagement in the LMS. Survey evidence revealed that students in hospitality and tourism programs with prior internet experience adapted more quickly. Although the majority of students agreed that online education facilitated remote study, they still preferred engaging in face-to-face sessions. Results additionally revealed that students believed that online learning would become a vital part of the future hospitality and tourism curricula.

Although the vaccine controls infection, understanding the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis will help in developing future therapies. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection induces inflammatory response, cytokine storm, venous thromboembolism, coagulopathy, and multiple organ damage. Resting endothelial cells prevent coagulation, control blood flow, and inhibit inflammation. However, it remains unknown how SARS-CoV-2 induces strong molecular signals in distant cells for immunopathogenesis. In this study, we examined the consequence of human endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), and liver endothelial cells (TMNK-1) to exosomes isolated from plasma of mild or severe COVID-19 patients. We observed a significant induction of NLRP3, caspase-1, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA expression in endothelial cells following exposure to exosomes from severe COVID-19 patients compared with that from patients with mild disease or healthy donors. Activation of caspase-1 was noted in the endothelial cell culture medium following exposure to the COVID-19 exosomes. Furthermore, COVID-19 exosomes significantly induced mature IL-1β secretion in both HMEC-1 and TMNK-1 endothelial cell culture medium. Thus, our results demonstrated for the first time that exosomes from COVID-19 plasma trigger NLRP3 inflammasome in endothelial cells of distant organs resulting in IL-1β secretion and inflammatory response. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global health problem. Although the vaccine controls infection, understanding the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis will help in developing future therapies. Furthermore, several investigators predicted the involvement of endothelial cell-related inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection and using extracellular vesicles as a cargo to carry a drug or vaccine for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the mechanism by which endothelial cells are inflamed remains unknown. Our present study highlights that exosomes from severe COVID-19 patients can enhance inflammasome activity in distant endothelial cells for augmentation of immunopathogenesis and opens an avenue for developing therapies.",2022.0,2022-02-04,30,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002d25febda8bb3b9b1005b0133ec0d6eb707908

Our study aims at identifying the role of hematological markers in the risk stratification and the need for ventilator support among ICU admitted COVID-19 patients. Method(s): A single centre prospective study was conducted on 100 Covid positive patients admitted in the ICU to determine association between the haematological markers such as Hb, Platelet count, Total and Differential leukocyte count, CRP, AST, ALT, LDH, Ferritin and D-Dimer with the need for oxygen therapy with or without invasive ventilatory support. Comparative analysis was performed between the 2 groups. Result(s): Neutrophilia, a mean of 76.7% among those ventilated and 71.6% among those non ventilated (p value 0.002;highly significant) and Lymphocytopenia (p value 0.004) with a mean of 14% and 18.6% respectively was noted. Hemoglobin levels were lower in ventilated (mean 11.6g/dl) as against those non ventilated (mean 12.58%) p value 0.046 which was significant. D-dimer was increased in COVID-19 patients;mean 5380 ng/ml in ventilated patients and mean 949ng/ml in those non ventilated (P < 0.001 highly significant). Elevated D-dimer and presence of diabetes correlated with increased chances of mechanical ventilation, while higher hemoglobin levels and associated COPD have a negative association with the need of mechanical ventilation. Conclusion(s): Hypercoagulability along with neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia can be used as positive associations for the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.

While the news is full of statistics about the COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths, not much has been written about the plight of students during the pandemic. This study looked into the lived experiences of the five education students enrolled in Batangas State University learning on their own at home during the time of the Luzonwide lockdown in the Philippines. This phenomenological research utilized voice calls (Messenger) in getting data from the participants. In analyzing the data, the researchers identified the frequent words or phrases, categorized the responses, then identified the themes. Four themes emerged from the interviews: students partook in asynchronous learning for grades; remote education during a pandemic affords students’ stress and anxiety; students prefer in-face classes over distance learning; and they have insufficient technology. The study concluded with the understanding that the sudden implementation of distance learning, the student-participants view this mode of learning as a means to comply and to cope with the set standards given the available measures and resources. The student-participants are able to experience the truly independent and individual manner of learning. Participants need to adjust to the new mode of learning, for they are still in the traditional face to face mode of delivery of learning and education and Resources and means to connect are the major concerns of students especially those in the remote areas both the region and nearby provinces.",2021.0,,3,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002d8c336ccbb22046ddc6bc2e1dd1dc7f22dab4
10.1101/2020.03.26.20044487,In-host Modelling of COVID-19 Kinetics in Humans,"COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the impact of emergent pathogens as a major threat for human health. The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent COVID-19 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of COVID-19 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics. Based on the target cell model, COVID-19 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for COVID-19 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of COVID-19 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.",2020.0,2020-03-30,42,63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002d925e1d7bc46f817f9865d6d0b1f0e9aa8de6
10.3389/fimmu.2022.1034444,An overview of viral mutagenesis and the impact on pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Viruses are submicroscopic, obligate intracellular parasites that carry either DNA or RNA as their genome, protected by a capsid. Viruses are genetic entities that propagate by using the metabolic and biosynthetic machinery of their hosts and many of them cause sickness in the host. The ability of viruses to adapt to different hosts and settings mainly relies on their ability to create de novo variety in a short interval of time. The size and chemical composition of the viral genome have been recognized as important factors affecting the rate of mutations. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a novel viral disease that has quickly become one of the world’s leading causes of mortality, making it one of the most serious public health problems in recent decades. The discovery of new medications to cope with Covid-19 is a difficult and time-consuming procedure, as new mutations represent a serious threat to the efficacy of recently developed vaccines. The current article discusses viral mutations and their impact on the pathogenicity of newly developed variants with a special emphasis on Covid-19. The biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), its mutations, pathogenesis, and treatment strategies are discussed in detail along with the statistical data.

Virtual education is one of the important factors in promoting the learning of medical students and has many benefits such as increasing the ability of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and self-directed learning. However, critically examining students’ perceptions of e-learning can help improve quality and better planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was a qualitative study. Twelve students were enrolled in the study based on purposive sampling. Data were collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews in 2020. All interviews were recorded and then transcribed and analyzed using a continuous comparison and conventional content analysis approach. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed four main themes and ten subthemes. The main themes included “student concern,” “teacher barriers,” “technology weakness,” and “asynchronous virtual learning flexibility.” CONCLUSION: Asynchronous e-learning in the COVID-19 outbreak had its advantages and disadvantages.

10.1101/2020.09.02.20186023,Digital droplet PCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 viral load from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus motivates diverse diagnostic approaches due to the novel causative pathogen, incompletely understood clinical sequelae, and limited availability of testing resources. Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance. Here, we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification. We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized universal transport medium (UTM). In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction. We also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load measurements from purified RNA. Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA as input. More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such techniques in laboratory medicine.",2020.0,2020-09-03,39,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002e65e5c7c3013a6d3994c2a4a9296d85c7f927

10.1371/journal.pone.0256763,The potential impact of triage protocols on racial disparities in clinical outcomes among COVID-positive patients in a large academic healthcare system,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact in the United States, particularly for Black populations, and has heavily burdened the healthcare system. Hospitals have created protocols to allocate limited resources, but there is concern that these protocols will exacerbate disparities. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score is a tool often used in triage protocols. In these protocols, patients with higher SOFA scores are denied resources based on the assumption that they have worse clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess whether using SOFA score as a triage tool among COVID-positive patients would exacerbate racial disparities in clinical outcomes. Methods We analyzed data from a retrospective cohort of hospitalized COVID-positive patients in the Yale-New Haven Health System. We examined associations between race/ethnicity and peak overall/24-hour SOFA score, in-hospital mortality, and ICU admission. Other predictors of interest were age, sex, primary language, and insurance status. We used one-way ANOVA and chi-square tests to assess differences in SOFA score across racial/ethnic groups and linear and logistic regression to assess differences in clinical outcomes by sociodemographic characteristics. Results Our final sample included 2,554 patients. Black patients had higher SOFA scores compared to patients of other races. However, Black patients did not have significantly greater in-hospital mortality or ICU admission compared to patients of other races. Conclusion While Black patients in this sample of hospitalized COVID-positive patients had higher SOFA scores compared to patients of other races, this did not translate to higher in-hospital mortality or ICU admission. Results demonstrate that if SOFA score had been used to allocate care, Black COVID patients would have been denied care despite having similar clinical outcomes to white patients. Therefore, using SOFA score to allocate resources has the potential to exacerbate racial inequities by disproportionately denying care to Black patients and should not be used to determine access to care. Healthcare systems must develop and use COVID-19 triage protocols that prioritize equity.",2021.0,2021-09-16,15,39,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002ece114ab11d587975306ecfccfa25f5f989b4

Objectives: To assess the magnitude of depression and anxiety among healthcare professionals before and after lifting of the lockdown restrictions in Saudi Arabia. Methods: Surveys targeting healthcare workers were circulated twice: during the lockdown, and 8 weeks after lifting of lockdown. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scales. Results: A total of 947 healthcare workers, with the mean age of (37 ± 8.9) responded to the surveys. Among these, 23–27% respondents reported clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression. Whereas, easing of the lockdown restrictions was shown to be associated with decreasing mean scores of PHQ-9 and GAD-7. The noted burden fell heavily on female workers, those with a current or a history of psychiatric disorders, suffering from chronic diseases, being in workplaces with high exposure to COVID-19 or in contact with COVID-19 patients, nurses, as well as those who were living with elderly and perceived their physical and mental health as “much worse” compared to the time before the pandemic.

We used a mixed effects model to investigate the potential associations of antibody levels one and three months after vaccination and examined by bootstrapping t-tests the putative effects of gender and age for each period. We also employed exact tests of independence in R × C contingency tables to explore associations between behavioral and gender variables with vaccinations side effects. We found significant differences between males and females as well as between subjects in the youngest (21–30 years) and the older age groups in both study periods. We also detected a decrease in titers with age and time. Males had steeper elimination rates across the age span in both periods, in contrast to females who exhibited a softer elimination titer rate with age in the first period and almost constant titers in the second. Concerning side effects, we found a significant association between pain at the injection site and female sex. Hence, our real-world data analyses revealed potentially important clues into the associations of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike.

A COVID-19 infection related to a GBS case was the only one that had preceding signs, including ageusia and hyposmia. By testing serum potassium levels, this study determined that there is no connection between GBS and hypokalemia, which can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic conundrums by evaluating serum potassium levels, which showed a normal value. Conclusion: One of the neurological symptoms of the COVID-19 infection is GBS. Several weeks after a COVID-19 acute infection, GBS is frequently observed.",2023.0,2023-04-18,0,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002fff90740e2d74713bd31160ef4a2f8d26b340

De caráter descritivo e qualitativo, este estudo de caso examinou 75 municípios sergipanos com base nos indicadores de transparência pública estabelecidos pela organização Transparência Internacional Brasil, na legislação brasileira e literatura especializada. Construiu-se um modelo de análise, fundamentando o desenvolvimento de um “índice de transparência de informação no combate à Covid-19” (ITI-COVID). Tal índice foi aplicado nos municípios investigados, o que permitiu perceber que há transparência no seu sentido intrínseco de divulgação de informação, mas não instrumental, ou seja, como ferramenta para promover accountability. A partir do índice utilizado, identificou-se que mais de 80% dos municípios sergipanos apresentam níveis insuficientes de transparência pública, o que os qualificam dentro do conceito de “transparência opaca” de Fox.",2022.0,2022-11-11,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0030496b8dc665a02e2668689afe0872f6f12267

10.1371/journal.pone.0277081,Detecting COVID-19 from digitized ECG printouts using 1D convolutional neural networks,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of healthcare services worldwide, raising the need to develop novel tools to provide rapid and cost-effective screening and diagnosis. Clinical reports indicated that COVID-19 infection may cause cardiac injury, and electrocardiograms (ECG) may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for COVID-19. This study aims to utilize ECG signals to detect COVID-19 automatically. We propose a novel method to extract ECG signals from ECG paper records, which are then fed into one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) to learn and diagnose the disease. To evaluate the quality of digitized signals, R peaks in the paper-based ECG images are labeled. Afterward, RR intervals calculated from each image are compared to RR intervals of the corresponding digitized signal. Experiments on the COVID-19 ECG images dataset demonstrate that the proposed digitization method is able to capture correctly the original signals, with a mean absolute error of 28.11 ms. The 1D-CNN model (SEResNet18), which is trained on the digitized ECG signals, allows to identify between individuals with COVID-19 and other subjects accurately, with classification accuracies of 98.42% and 98.50% for classifying COVID-19 vs. Normal and COVID-19 vs. other classes, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method also achieves a high-level of performance for the multi-classification task. Our findings indicate that a deep learning system trained on digitized ECG signals can serve as a potential tool for diagnosing COVID-19.",2022.0,2022-08-10,12,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0030ab8e8756164899f6a3b7640242b448a3cb6d

Both dispositional and situational factors have been recognized as significant contributors to workplace stress and demands, particularly evident during challenging times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Even professions known for their demanding work environments, such as law enforcement, have not been immune to these pressures. The research conducted a quantitative analysis, surveying 208 employees of the South African Police Services. The study incorporated self-administered questionnaires, employing statistical methods like correlation, ANOVA, and multiple regression analysis. This multifaceted approach assessed the relationships between workplace bullying, situational factors, dispositional factors, and demographics (including gender, age, qualifications, and years of service). The study’s findings highlighted a substantial and positive link between dispositional characteristics and workplace bullying, similarly, noting a favorable association between situational conditions and bullying. Consequently, the research underscores the importance of considering both dispositional and situational factors in comprehending workplace bullying among police officers. This South African study offers valuable insights by bridging a significant knowledge gap on workplace bullying among law enforcement personnel. It emphasizes the relevance of examining the interplay between dispositional and situational factors in understanding and addressing workplace bullying in diverse contexts.",2024.0,2024-02-18,0,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0030b13d4c479a5c48ca1ffaebddabbb339c4b4e

Recent reports of reduction in antibody levels and the re-emergence of the disease in recovered patients necessitated the understanding of the pandemic at the core level. The cases of multiple organ failures emphasized the consideration of different organ systems while managing the disease. The present study employed RNA sequencing data to determine the disease associated differentially regulated genes and their related protein interactions in several organ systems. It signified the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. A map of protein interactions of multiple organ systems was built and uncovered CAV1 and CTNNB1 as the top degree nodes. A core interactions sub-network was analyzed to identify different modules of functional significance. AR, CTNNB1, CAV1, and PIK3R1 proteins were unfolded as bridging nodes interconnecting different modules for the information flow across several pathways. The present study also highlighted some of the druggable targets to analyze in drug re-purposing strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rapid point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics to detect the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, are urgently needed to identify and isolate patients, contain its spread and guide clinical management. In this work, we report the development of a rapid PoC diagnostic test (<20 min) based on reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and semiconductor technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from extracted RNA samples. The developed LAMP assay was tested on a real-time benchtop instrument (RT-qLAMP) showing a lower limit of detection of 10 RNA copies per reaction. It was validated against extracted RNA from 183 clinical samples including 127 positive samples (screened by the CDC RT-qPCR assay). Results showed 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity when compared to RT-qPCR and average positive detection times of 15.45 ± 4.43 min. For validating the incorporation of the RT-LAMP assay onto our PoC platform (RT-eLAMP), a subset of samples was tested (n = 52), showing average detection times of 12.68 ± 2.56 min for positive samples (n = 34), demonstrating a comparable performance to a benchtop commercial instrument.

The aim was to describe the obstetric-perinatal and neonatal outcome of infected pregnant women and their newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Methods: Three bibliographical databases were searched (last search: 10 September 2020). Quality assessment was performed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Primary outcomes included mode of delivery, preterm delivery/labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM/pPROM) and abortions/miscarriages. Outcomes were mainly presented as ranges. A separate analysis, including only moderate and high-quality systematic reviews, was also conducted. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214447); (3) Results: Thirty-nine reviews were analyzed. Reported rates, regarding both preterm and term gestations, varied between 52.3 and 95.8% for cesarean sections; 4.2–44.7% for vaginal deliveries; 14.3–63.8% specifically for preterm deliveries and 22.7–32.2% for preterm labor; 5.3–12.7% for PROM and 6.4–16.1% for pPROM. Maternal anxiety for potential fetal infection contributed to abortion decisions, while SARS-CoV-2-related miscarriages could not be excluded. Maternal ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were 3–28.5% and 1.4–12%, respectively. Maternal mortality rate was <2%, while stillbirth, neonatal ICU admission and mortality rates were <2.5%, 3.1–76.9% and <3%, respectively. Neonatal PCR positivity rates ranged between 1.6% and 10%. After accounting for quality of studies, ranges of our primary outcomes remained almost unchanged, while among our secondary outcomes, maternal ICU admission (3–10%) and mechanical ventilation rates (1.4–5.5%) were found to be relatively lower; (4) Conclusions: Increased rates of cesarean sections and preterm birth rates were found, with iatrogenic reasons potentially involved.

10.4045/tidsskr.20.0405,Outbreak of COVID-19 at three nursing homes in Bergen.,"BACKGROUND
Nursing home residents are generally old and frail, and at high risk that COVID-19 will take a serious course. Outbreaks of COVID-19 have not previously been described in Norway, and it is important to identify mechanisms for spread of the infection and course of disease for nursing home residents with this pandemic disease.


MATERIAL AND METHOD
We included residents from three nursing homes with outbreaks of COVID-19 in a retrospective observational study, and we retrieved information on the number of staff for whom SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed or who were placed in quarantine. We present resident characteristics, course of disease and mortality associated with COVID-19 in the nursing homes, as well as providing a brief description of the outbreaks.


RESULTS
Forty residents were included, 26 of whom were women. The average age was 86.2 years. Thirty-seven of the residents had atypical symptoms, nine of them were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and 21 died during the coronavirus infection. Contact tracing indicated that the outbreaks may have originated from staff in the pre-symptomatic or early and mild phase of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in forty-two staff members, and a further 115 were placed in quarantine.


INTERPRETATION
Many residents had atypical disease presentation, and the mortality from COVID-19 was high. Spread of infection may have originated from staff, also before they displayed obvious symptoms, and contributed to extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the three nursing homes.",2020.0,2020-06-18,25,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00326aa070f4aa7a0237cb6fa5ed2c653ef969ff

10.1093/ofid/ofac492.1587,1962. Perceptions of the COVID-19 Vaccine within the Sudanese-American Community,"Abstract Background One of the primary issues affecting COVID-19 vaccine uptake in high-income countries is vaccine hesitancy, which is prevalent in people from different countries of origin. Characterizing vaccine uptake in immigrant and refugee populations in the US could provide a unique window into both local and global health behaviors. The goal of this project is to characterize Sudanese American perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods We conducted an anonymous, online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey directed toward Sudanese Americans, with survey development guided by principles from the Vaccine Examination Scale. The survey was distributed in both English and Arabic and included questions about vaccination history, motives for getting the vaccination, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and barriers to vaccination. Fisher’s exact tests were used to analyze evaluate possible associations between vaccine uptake and sources of information on the vaccine and social media use, respectively. Data analysis was conducted using STATA SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Results A total of 108 survey responses were received; 4 were excluded for failing to meet inclusion criteria. A total of 92% received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with the primary motivation being to protect oneself (62%). Only 8 had not been vaccinated and, of those, 2 were willing to take the vaccine. Of the 6 unwilling to take the vaccine, the most cited reason was a belief that it had not been studied enough. Of the 14 possible hesitancy responses, 9 were selected at least once. When asked about their primary source of information on COVID-19, 44% used government websites, followed by mass media (22%), social media (12%) and health personnel (11%). Using Fisher’s exact tests, no statistically significant conclusions were drawn between vaccine uptake and primary source of information (P = .097) or specific types of social media. Conclusion Vaccine uptake among our survey population (92%) was much higher than that of the US (77%) or Sudanese population (11%). Overall motivators for vaccine hesitancy and vaccine uptake varied and no specific correlations were found to be associated to vaccine uptake. Future research should evaluate high levels of vaccine uptake in this community.

10.32394/pe.75.03,The smoker's paradox during the COVID-19 pandemic? The influence of smoking and vaping on the incidence and course of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection as well as possibility of using nicotine in the treatment of COVID-19 - Review of the literature.,"AIM OF THE STUDY
The study aims to present the current state of knowledge on the impact of traditional cigarettes and the nicotine contained in them on the incidence and course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we decided to exhibit the possibility of using this substance to treat COVID-19 infections.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
The latest available scientific publications were reviewed until November 14, 2020, from the PubMed platform.


RESULTS
Nicotine is a cholinergic agonist and pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibitor. Some authors present that smoking and nicotine reduce the amount of the ACE2 receptors which are used by the novel coronavirus to enter cells, while others claim that ACE2 receptors are upregulated in smokers. Moreover, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with nAChR is suspected of dysregulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system, which is associated with the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Due to the harmfulness of cigarettes, a high frequency of smokers is suspected among people suffering from COVID-19. However, some studies report that the number of current smokers hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than expected, considering the prevalence of smoking in individual countries. Nicotine could restore the impaired function of the nicotine cholinergic system and possibly mitigate the cytokine storm.


CONCLUSIONS
There is no clear attitude regarding the impact of smoking on the new coronavirus infection now. Researchers do not recommend smoking as a tool to combat the pandemic and show the importance of fighting addiction to reduce the adverse health effects of smoking.

Materials and Methods We evaluated 11 inpatients with shock, with or without acute dyspnea, for whom general practitioners spontaneously requested remote evaluation by a specialist. Results All of the general practitioners accepted the protocol and were able to position the transducer correctly, thus obtaining key images of the internal jugular vein, lungs, and inferior vena cava when guided remotely by a telemedicine physician, who interpreted all of the findings. However, only four (36%) of the on-site general practitioners obtained the appropriate key image of the heart in the left parasternal long-axis view, and only three (27%) received an immediate interpretation of an image from the remote physician. The mean evaluation time was 22.7 ± 12 min (range, 7-42 min). Conclusion Even in life-threatening situations, untrained general practitioners may be correctly guided by telemedicine specialists to perform multiorgan point-of-care ultrasound in order to improve bedside diagnostic evaluation.",2022.0,2022-05-02,3,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00336ca15611d3c0cc96f62999f41b2a5633be70

The estimated populations are around 47 million people who are affected by the virus and around 300,000 (16th May 2020) deaths resulted from the outbreak. The rate might keep on increasing due to the non-availability of a proper vaccine, following proper management with epidemiological studies, and displacement of contact individuals as a source of transmission in particular viral-prone regions. CoVID 19 is on its vigorous spread leading to a global impact on lots of sectors. The outreaching impacts play a role in international politics, scientific developments, and economic crises over the world, and global relations among the countries.

Design and Setting: A national longitudinal survey using a framework based on evidence-based behaviour change models. The survey was administered to a national sample representative across sex, age and location was undertaken at two time points: May 1st to 5th, 2020, and July 1st to 7th, 2020. Results: Overall 2,056 surveys were completed across the first and second rounds, with 63% (1,296/2,056) completing both. Age range was 18–99 years (median 53, IQR: 34–64). Suboptimal physical distancing and self-quarantining if unwell/diagnosed was reported in one in four respondents and not getting a test at onset of symptoms reported in one in three. Those non-adherent to all three behaviours (19%, 60/323), were mainly male, younger, lived in major cities and reported fewer concerns or motivators to change behaviour. Overall, government lockdown measures were considered very important by 81% (835/1,032) and appropriate by 75% (772/1,029). Conclusions: Prior to the suppression of a second COVID-19 wave, a significant minority of Australians reported suboptimal behavioural adherence to vital policy strategies to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread, mostly young adults and men. Successful wave 2 suppression required consistent communication from political and health leaders and supportive public health and economic strategies. Additional lockdown and punitive strategies were needed in Victoria and were generally well-supported and adhered to. To limit subsequent lockdown, this work reinforces the need for a mix of communication around saving lives of the vulnerable, and other strategies targeting high risk groups, facilitation of easy testing and minimisation of financial impacts.",2021.0,2021-06-02,10,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003458b8d33a2a94c46a3b8868545ca0c8cf4994

MÉTODOS Os dados oficiais para covid-19 dos estados do Nordeste são referentes ao período de março de 2020 a março de 2021. A análise para capitais e estados da série do acumulado semanal de casos e de óbitos confirmados foi feita com emprego do aplicativo JoinPoint Trend Analysis. RESULTADOS Em um ano, o Nordeste acumulou 22,9% dos casos e 21,5% dos óbitos do país pela covid-19. No início da pandemia, todos os estados apresentaram um crescimento sustentável de casos, primeiro nas capitais e depois interior. Em seguida, observam-se decréscimos em todos os estados e suas capitais, porém muitos permanecem com números elevados. Em meados do segundo semestre de 2020, o número de casos começa a crescer nos estados e suas capitais, alguns em velocidade explosiva, em especial no final de 2020 e início de 2021. Padrão similar é observado para os óbitos, os quais ultrapassaram ou aproximam-se do teto observado na primeira onda, na qual todas as capitais e estados do Nordeste adotaram intensas medidas de isolamento. Fortaleza, Recife e Teresina atingiram os maiores índices de isolamento de todas as capitais, perto de 0,60. Esse índice decresce, com tendência leve de crescimento até final de dezembro, voltando a decrescer. Com exceção de Fortaleza e Salvador, as demais capitais caíram para menos de 0,40. CONCLUSÃO O Nordeste brasileiro e o país estão em uma situação sanitária, social e econômica cada vez mais complexa.

10.4103/NJM.NJM_67_21,Review of COVID-19 vaccine,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accounts for over 92 million confirmed cases worldwide, with over 2.06 million deaths. In the past year, more than 290 candidate vaccines have been tested; COVID-19 vaccine development was sped up, with shortened timeline, due to the urgent global need in the face of the pandemic. In addition, people with the highest risk of contracting the disease, such as health workers with a high risk of exposure, elderlies, and people with underlying comorbidities, were prioritized with vaccination rollout. The article narratively reviewed original and review articles available on PubMed and Google Scholar related to the theme to provide up-to-date information. The different templates developed and studied for COVID-19 vaccines include the whole-virus vaccine, viral vector vaccine, nucleic acid (deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid), and protein subunit vaccine. Myths impede vaccine uptake in this part of the globe. Adopting these myths leads to sharing and spreading, which negatively impacts the prevention of COVID-19 and vaccine uptake. Adverse event following immunizations (AEFIs) is classified based on severity, from minor to severe. The minor ones are common events that pose no potential health risks to the receiver of the vaccine. The type determines the safety profile, severity, and frequency of AEFIs observed with the vaccine administration.

10.4054/demres.2021.45.45,COVID-19 fatality in Germany: Demographic determinants of variation in case-fatality rates across and within German federal states during the first and second waves,"BACKGROUND Germany experienced one of the lowest COVID-19 case-fatality rates (CFRs) in Western Europe in the first pandemic wave, and further CFR decreases in the spring and summer of 2020. However, Germany's CFR increased markedly during the second wave, becoming one of the highest in Western Europe. Furthermore, CFRs varied considerably across German federal states. The drivers of this CFR time trend and the state differences remain unclear. OBJECTIVE We aim to identify the contribution to the CFR differences across and within German states of (1) the population age structure, (2) the age structure of confirmed infection rates, and (3) the age-specific fatality. METHODS We use data documenting COVID-19 cases and deaths from the COVerAGE-DB, applying demographic decomposition methods proposed by Kitagawa and Horiuchi. RESULTS The CFR decrease between spring and autumn 2020 in Germany resulted from a shift toward younger ages in confirmed infection rates and decreasing age-specific fatality. The CFR increase that followed was predominantly driven by a shift toward older ages in the age composition of confirmed infection rates. Although most of the CFR variation across German states resulted from differences in the population age distribution, differences in the age structure of detected infection rates contributed substantially to this variation. CONCLUSIONS Differences in German CFRs depended mainly on the age structure of the population and the confirmed infection rates. Age-specific fatality played a noteworthy role only in CFR changes over time.

We characterise the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs. Methods We used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterised the role of RNAaemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression. Findings 23.0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1.4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAaemia 10 days after onset of symptoms, but took 16 days to reach maximum severity, and 33 days for symptoms to resolve. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6.72 [95% CI, 2.45-19.79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2.43 [95% CI, 1.07-5.38]), and EPCs (OR 2.81 [95% CI, 1.26-6.36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.20-0.67]). Interpretation dPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAaemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.",2020.0,2020-12-22,7,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0035150c14c31738fe354d88ff8403da6c0fc11f

We model the testing, isolation and transmission of COVID-19 within quarantine facilities to estimate the risk of community outbreaks being seeded at the border. We use a simple branching process model for COVID-19 transmission that includes a time-dependent probability of a false-negative test result. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with two tests is highly effective in preventing an infectious case entering the community, provided there is no transmission within quarantine facilities. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increases the risk of an infectious case being released. We calculate the fraction of cases detected in the second week of their two-week stay and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of transmission occurring within quarantine facilities. Frontline staff working at the border risk exposure to infected individuals and this has the potential to lead to a community outbreak.

Supported by funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the FDA‘s genomic epidemiology program, GenomeTrakr, was leveraged to sequence SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater sites across the United States. This initiative required the evaluation, optimization, development, and publication of new methods and analytical tools spanning sample collection through variant analyses. Version-controlled protocols for each step of the process were developed and published on protocols.io. A custom data analysis tool and a publicly accessible dashboard were built to facilitate real-time visualization of the collected data, focusing on the relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-lineages across different samples and sites throughout the project. From September 2021 through June 2023, a total of 3,389 wastewater samples were collected, with 2,517 undergoing sequencing and submission to NCBI under the umbrella BioProject, PRJNA757291. Sequence data were released with explicit quality control (QC) tags on all sequence records, communicating our confidence in the quality of data. Variant analysis revealed wide circulation of Delta in the fall of 2021 and captured the sweep of Omicron and subsequent diversification of this lineage through the end of the sampling period. This project successfully achieved two important goals for the FDA’s GenomeTrakr program: first, contributing timely genomic data for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response, and second, establishing both capacity and best practices for culture-independent, population-level environmental surveillance for other pathogens of interest to the FDA. IMPORTANCE This paper serves two primary objectives. First, it summarizes the genomic and contextual data collected during a Covid-19 pandemic response project, which utilized the FDA’s laboratory network, traditionally employed for sequencing foodborne pathogens, for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater samples. Second, it outlines best practices for gathering and organizing population-level next generation sequencing (NGS) data collected for culture-free, surveillance of pathogens sourced from environmental samples.

It is unclear whether these changes have been sustained and how they are perceived by faculty. Methods We surveyed a defined population of GP practices during April 2022 with questions to elicit estimates of medical student involvement in different types of remote consultation and supervisor ratings of their confidence in supervising different modalities of remote consultation. We performed thematic analysis on free text responses from a 'resistance to change’ perspective. Results A response rate of 96% (n = 115) was achieved. Analysis of quantitative data identified that a significant proportion of student consultations were remote, however there was a large variation between practices. Supervisor confidence was lowest for students consulting from home. Thematic analysis identified ways in which clinical supervisors may perceive the innovation to be at odds with their overriding commitments to safety, simplicity and quality. Conclusions Remote consultations form a significant proportion of medical student activity in many practices.

10.5455/jmas.93907,Evaluation of inflammatory markers in COVID-19 positive patients and their correlation with age,"The global widespread of Corona virus disease is still having a catastrophic impact on mankind. COVID-19 has depicted its uncertain adversity in all age groups and the coexistence of co-morbidities have further shown a critical aspect of disease which has additionally ravaged the health status of the patients. The inflammatory markers have exhibited potential usefulness in predicting the outcome of the disease. The Aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation of inflammatory markers in COVID-19 positive patients among various age groups. The study was done on 225 COVID-19 patients, admitted to Mayo Institute of Medical Sciences, Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh India, between 1st April-15th June 2021 categorizing into two groups based on their age (≤45 years and >45 years) and then values of various markers were gathered and compared. Among the 225 admitted COVID-19 patients, 78(34.6%) were ≤45 years, while the remaining 147(65.4%) were >45 years. Between these two age groups the aberrant values of inflammatory makers like Neutrophil count (p=0.0001), Lymphocyte count (p=0.0001), Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) (p=0.0091), Serum CRP level (p=0.0437), Lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) (p=0.0007) as well as Serum Ferritin level (p=0.0097) were found to be statistically significant whereas the remaining parameters like Total leucocyte count (TLC) (p=0.0905), Platelet count (p=0.8202) and Platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (p=0.1513) were statistically insignificant. The results conclude that there was a significant correlation between the age and the inflammatory markers in these patients. Patients with > 45 years had elevated/deranged levels of inflammatory markers, which were associated with the severity and poor prognosis of the disease. Thus, age can be considered as one of the important key risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in both sexes and hence more clinical attention should be given to elderly age group.",2022.0,,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00356d0e00346f0fcca0337357a8fc0376ffaabf

We carried out a systematic review of the recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on the provision of dental care issued during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic database search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Epistemonikos, and Trip databases to identify documents with recommendations intended to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission during dental care. The selection process and data extraction were carried out by two researchers independently. The majority of CPGs recommended the use of rubber dam, high-volume evacuator, mouthwash prior to dental care, four-handed work, and mechanical barriers. The use of aerosol-generating equipment should be avoided whenever possible. In aerosol-generating procedures, the use of a N95 respirator (or similar) is recommended, in addition to a face protector, an impermeable disposable apron/gown, a cap, and gloves. The CPGs developed during the first year of the pandemic offer recommendations which guide dental staff in providing safe dental care, minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in the clinical environment.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to replicate and spread, although which RBPs control SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Here, we employ a multi-omic approach to identify systematically and comprehensively which cellular and viral RBPs are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reveal that the cellular RNA-bound proteome is remodelled upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, having widespread effects on RNA metabolic pathways, non-canonical RBPs and antiviral factors. Moreover, we apply a new method to identify the proteins that directly interact with viral RNA, uncovering dozens of cellular RBPs and six viral proteins. Amongst them, several components of the tRNA ligase complex, which we show regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

But till date, no conclusive specific treatment has been found, and we are following the protocols with symptomatic management. Ayurveda is an ancient science of healing, with highly sophisticated literature about diseases, their pathogenesis, clinical features, and management. The evaluation of different modalities for treating COVID-19 pandemic patients is the foremost aim of the study. For review, we used the knowledge of the ancient classics and past literature regarding human treatment guidelines mentioned in Ayurveda classics, for prevention and treatment of communicable diseases, to provide appropriate direction in the prevention of COVID-19. The thorough review has been done, of literature, Samhitas(Ayurveda Classics), and research articles which were published between January and June 2020 by PubMed, Google Scholar, WHO, Ministry of AYUSH. The opinions of experts have also been referred to. As individuals with lower immunity have a higher risk of COVID-19, so the herbal Rasayana(Rejuvenating) drug, which has proven immunomodulatory activity, is also included in the given study. The Review for Ayurveda formulations, which might help in preventing the progression of COVID-19, has also been made. The Indian herbs are widely utilized in the preparation of Ayurvedic medicines or formulations or in the form of drinks to manage various respiratory disorders such as cough, cold, and flu. Hence, these drugs are formulated by using active parts of the plants, which are used for preventing and treating the COVID-19.

10.26668/businessreview/2023.v8i8.1973,Assessing the Moderating Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Online Customer Purchashing Behaviour in the Fashion Industry of Bangaldesh,"Theoretical framework: The study measures influence of the independent variables such as product price, quality, brand image, data privacy concerns, and cultural dimension (UAI) over the past couple of years of the pandemic. The proposed conceptual framework has one dependent variable (online customer purchasing behaviour) and one mediator (online customer purchasing intention). Covid 19 Pandemic is hypothesized to moderate the relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable.
 
Design/Methodology/Approach: The authors used inferential statistics to accomplish the purpose of the research. Via quantitative analysis using the SPSS, the factors that influence online shopping have been revealed by gathering and analysing data obtained over web-based surveys. The authors approached 500 respondents from the 12th of April 2021 to the 5th of June 2022 and got close to a 73% response rate, 364 responses.
 
Findings: The results exhibit that all mentioned factors except brand image and data privacy concerns have a momentous and significant relationship with consumers’ online shopping behaviour which further gets stronger due to the moderating effect of Covid-19.
 
Research practical and social implications: The study contributes to the existing literature and theories in terms of monitoring online customer purchase behaviour.  The findings will also help companies to develop and enhance their current CRM strategy and innovations to manage online shopping behaviour and achieve their commercial targets.
 
Originality/Value: The value of this study lies in its contribution to an understanding of online purchase behaviour, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. By identifying influential factors and exploring their impact, the findings provide actionable insights for companies to adapt to changing consumer behaviours.",2023.0,2023-08-09,2,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0036777c81aab5291330f67341cc6c6123927486
10.2196/26318,User Experiences of the NZ COVID Tracer App in New Zealand: Thematic Analysis of Interviews,"Background For mobile app–based COVID-19 contact tracing to be fully effective, a large majority of the population needs to be using the app on an ongoing basis. However, there is a paucity of studies of users, as opposed to potential adopters, of mobile contact tracing apps and of their experiences. New Zealand, a high-income country with western political culture, was successful in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and its experience is valuable for informing policy responses in similar contexts. Objective This study asks the following research questions: (1) How do users experience the app in their everyday contexts? and (2) What drives the use of the app? Methods Residents of New Zealand’s Auckland region, which encompasses the country’s largest city, were approached via Facebook, and 34 NZ COVID Tracer app users were interviewed. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Interviews ranged in duration from 15 to 50 minutes. Participants ranged in age from those in their late teens to those in their early sixties. Even though about half of the participants identified as White New Zealanders of European origin, different ethnicities were represented, including New Zealanders of South Pacific, Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, and Southeast Asian descent. Out of 34 participants, 2 (6%) identified as Māori (Indigenous New Zealanders). A broad range of careers were represented, from top-middle management to health support work and charity work. Likewise, educational backgrounds ranged broadly, from high school completion to master’s degrees. Out of 34 participants, 2 (6%) were unemployed, having recently lost their jobs because of the pandemic. The thematic analysis resulted in five major themes: perceived benefits, patterns of use, privacy, social influence, and need for collective action. Benefits of using the app to society in general were more salient to the participants than immediate health benefits to the individual. Use, however, depended on the alert level and tended to decline for many participants at low alert levels. Privacy considerations played a small role in shaping adoption and use, even though the participants were highly aware of privacy discourse around the app. Participants were aware of the need for high levels of adoption and use of the app to control the pandemic. Attempts to encourage others to use the app were common, although not always successful. Conclusions Appeals to civic responsibility are likely to drive the use of a mobile contact tracing app under the conditions of high threat. Under the likely scenario of COVID-19 remaining endemic and requiring ongoing vigilance over the long term, other mechanisms promoting the use of mobile contact tracing apps may be needed, such as offering incentives. As privacy is not an important concern for many users, flexible privacy settings in mobile contact tracing apps allowing users to set their optimal levels of privacy may be appropriate.",2020.0,2020-12-07,24,52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003678fbbf3641901fe44eee596f0adf6aacc65a

To this end, we reviewed and critically examined emerging scholarly literature as well as policy documents and reports published by international development organizations concerning female workers’ social sustainability, livelihood, and health and wellbeing issues in global supply chain operations. Thus, this article focuses on female workers’ issues in emerging and developing economies where the ongoing pandemic continues to devastate and create multidimensional social and economic challenges for the wellbeing and social sustainability of female workers. Our analysis suggests that female workers are facing serious socioeconomic challenges that continue to affect their wellbeing, mental health, and livelihoods. Accordingly, it is imperative that international development organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade associations, governments, and most importantly the corporate sector not only consider individual responsibility for promoting female workforce social sustainability in global supply chains but also actively collaborate to address pressing social sustainability issues vis à vis female workers.

The purpose of the study is to analyze healthcare-associated infections in the Ruse region of Bulgaria by medical facilities and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on them for 2014-2021. Materials and methods: The study covers the registration of patients who were served and registered healthcare-associated infections sorted by year in all medical facilities (9 units) in the district. The data was collected from the system for epidemiological surveillance of hospitals, and the analysis of the country and Ruse region and the analysis of the Ruse Regional Health Inspectorate. Documentary, statistical, and graphic methods are used. Results and discussion: The data show that the number of patients served in the district in 2014-2021 increased (71,501 people in 2014), with small fluctuations in 2017, among which it fell to the initial level of 71,014 for 2021. There are data on the influence of the population structure and the workload of medical facilities. One of the hospitals - University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment ""Kanev"" JSC, Ruse accounts for almost half of the patients admitted for treatment. Reported cases of healthcare-associated infections in the region by year show holding at one level, with no sharp fluctuations until 2019. A link has been established between the increasing incidence of COVID-19 and registered healthcare-associated infections in 2020 and 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic affected both healthcare-associated infections prevalence and pathogen profiles. Conclusions: In the initial period from 2014 to 2016, surgical site infections - 49.38% (2014), 33.00% (2015), and 18.35% (2016) were leading in the structure of the health-care-associated infections, followed by respiratory infections 17.93%.

The aim of the study was to describe the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of 204 definitive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi province, Iran. Patients and Methods: This study was performed on 204 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. A set of laboratory tests combined with various patient information and results from lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) were gathered in a checklist and analyzed to give us a better view of patients who are hospitalized due to the complications caused by this disease. Results: The average age of our patients was 58.83 ± 15.93 years. There were 122 (59.8%) male and 82 (40.2%) female patients, and almost all of our patients had at least one underlying disease. Nine (4.4%) of our patients reported having gone for a trip to COVID-19-epidemic areas in the last 2 weeks. The most common signs shared among all our patients were cough, fever, and decreased O2 saturation; the average respiratory rate was 25.50 ± 6.74/min, average axillary body temperature was 37.69°C ± 0.69°C, and average O2 saturation was 88.34% ± 7.34%. Conclusion: Based on our results, the most common signs of this disease are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, similar to seasonal influenza. Our data on disease severity showed that 33 (16.2%) patients had moderate disease, 139 (68.1%) had severe disease, and 28 (13.7%) were critical; 22 (10.8%) of our hospitalized patients died due to the complications of this disease.",2022.0,2022-05-01,2,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0037219d6500315d839f86e74b328c3b6399c661

Patients and methods Between April 2020 and April 2022, a total of 3,549 upper extremity fractures occurring in 1,028 pediatric patients (682 males, 346 females; median age: 7 years; range, 0 to 18 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Those who presented between the dates of April 1st, 2020 and April 1st, 2021 (quarantine) were included in Group 1, whereas those who presented between April 1st, 2021 and April 2nd, 2022 (post-quarantine) were included in Group 2. The fracture map also showed the fracture density and location. Results There were statistically significant differences in terms of age range between Groups 1 and 2 (p<0.01). The 6-11 age range was significantly higher in Group 1, and the 12-18 age range was significantly higher in Group 2. Conclusion Reducing physical activity during quarantine reduces fractures, particularly in adolescents. The removal of restrictions increases fractures in children in this age range.

This anxiety can trigger stress which can interfere with students' academic performance. Therefore, this condition is a critical problem that needs to be addressed immediately. However, researchers have not previously conducted much research to detect post-COVID stress levels. Apart from that, the existence of a system capable of carrying out this detection is still lacking. Therefore, this research focuses on building a system for detecting student stress levels. First, an exploration of the tree algorithm was carried out to find the most optimal method for recognizing student stress levels. Then a detection system is built using this optimal method. The research results show that the tree ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm achieves the highest accuracy value of 95% compared to other tree algorithms with the scenario of dividing training data into test data of 80%:20%. Moreover, this telegram bot-based detection system works well in recognizing three categories of stress, namely: light-, moderate-, and heavy stress based on black-box testing techniques.",2024.0,2024-10-01,0,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0038150d0db73c5ae2ff65c9b1bb8402e4bef33e
10.38159/ehass.2022sp31116,Self-efficacy and Academic Performance of Mathematics Students in a South African University during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Students’ learning contexts are capable of having a significant impact on their learning beliefs and academic performance. As a result, students studying during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak may be at risk of lower academic self-efficacy and subject grades. These students may also hold specific ideas regarding the impact of COVID-19-related changes on their ability to succeed, which could have a direct impact on their self-efficacy and academic performance. Thus, this study seeks to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the self-efficacy and academic performance of mathematics students in a South African university. The paper also sought to examine how teaching and learning in a mathematics education classroom can be sustained post-COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the study was underpinned by an interpretivist paradigm. The study employed a qualitative research approach and a case study design in which the participant of the study were mathematics education lecturers, heads of departments, and pre-service mathematics student-teachers registered for the 2019/20 academic session at the faculty of education in the selected university. Data for the study was collected through the use of a semi-structured interview. The findings of the study revealed that although students’ self-efficacy is adversely impacted by negative emotions like tension, the psychological strain of confinement, academic workload demands, online assessment, and the loss of relatives brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, these factors have no impact on students’ academic performance. Furthermore, findings revealed that for the teaching and learning of mathematics education to be sustained post-COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dire need for a change in curriculum as well as the pedagogical approaches. Based on the findings of the study, it was concluded that even though the original goal of the sudden transition in the education system was to salvage the academic year, it is now evident that maintaining teaching and learning in higher education institutions will require more than just changing instructional delivery but mathematics education lecturers should adopt the lessons learned from online instruction and develop opportunities for a hybrid approach to teaching-learning.

Methods A cross-sectional retrospective study using an online questionnaire was conducted between October 2022 and December 2022. Data were collected concerning demographic variables, clinical conditions, menstrual cycle characteristics, COVID-19 infection status, and vaccination history. Results Of the 525 female students who participated in the study (mean age, 21.5 ± 3.9 years; mean body mass index, 22.7 ± 4.7 kg/m2), 246 (46.9%) had tested positive for COVID-19, 15 (2.9%) had visited the emergency room, and eight (1.5%) had been hospitalized. The average duration between menstrual cycles increased significantly among the study sample (pre-pandemic, 25.9 ± 5.3 days; post-pandemic, 26.8 ± 6.7 days; p = 0.016). Pre-pandemic, 221 (42.1%) participants reported less than two days of variance between their shortest and longest cycles, as compared with 175 (33.3%) post-pandemic (p < 0.001). Regarding vaccination, 393 (74.9%) participants had received three vaccinations, and 110 (21%) had received two vaccinations. Post-vaccination, 184 (35%) participants reported no changes to their menstrual cycle, 154 (29.3%) reported less disruption, and 44 (8.4%) experienced more disrupted menstrual cycles. Conclusion This study highlights potential associations between the COVID-19 pandemic, subsequent vaccinations, and changes in menstrual patterns, which can help to elucidate the physiological and psychological effects of pandemics and vaccination campaigns on women’s health. Future studies must consider biological and psychosocial factors to elucidate underlying mechanisms and causal relationships.",2024.0,2024-09-01,0,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0038f5612b8cb873cc196a4edb56596992838190

Objectives: (1) Evaluate the effects of the Breath-Body-Mind Introductory Course (BBMIC) on COVID-related stress among employees of the Regional Integrated Support for Education, Northern Ireland, (2) Reduce the risk of adverse effects from COVID-related stress, and (3) Evaluate the effects of BBMIC on indicators of psychophysiological states and the consistency with hypothesized mechanisms of action. Methods In this single group study, a convenience sample of 39 female healthcare workers completed informed consent and baseline measures: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Stress Overload Scale-Short (SOS-S), and Exercise-Induced Feelings Inventory (EFI). Following the online BBMIC 4 h/day for 3 days and the 6 week solo (20 min/day) and group practice (45 min weekly), repeat testing plus the Indicators of Psychophysiological State (IPSS) and Program Evaluation were obtained. Results Baseline (T1) mean PSS score was significantly elevated compared to a normative sample: PSS = 18.2 vs. 13.7 (p < 0.001) and improved significantly 11 weeks post-BBMIC (T4). SOS-S mean score declined from 10.7(T1) to 9.7 at 6 week post-test (T3). The SOS-S proportion of High Risk scores found in 22/29 participants (T1), dropped to 7/29 (T3). EFI mean subscale scores improved significantly from T1 to T2 and T3 for Revitalization (p < 0.001); Exhaustion (p < 0.002); and Tranquility (p < 0.001); but not Engagement (p < 0.289). Conclusion Among RISE NI healthcare workers affected by COVID-related stress, participation in the BBMIC significantly reduced scores for Perceived Stress, Stress Overload, and Exhaustion. EFI Revitalization and Tranquility scores significantly improved. More than 60% of participants reported moderate to very strong improvements in 22 indicators of psychophysiological state, e.g., tension, mood, sleep, mental focus, anger, connectedness, awareness, hopefulness, and empathy. These results are consistent with the hypothesized mechanisms of action whereby voluntarily regulated breathing exercises change interoceptive messaging to brain regulatory networks that shift psychophysiological states of distress and defense to states of calmness and connection. These positive findings warrant validation in larger, controlled studies to extend the understanding of how breath-centered Mind-body Medicine practices could mitigate adverse effects of stress.",2023.0,2023-06-12,3,71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0038f5c659b932ba220c950dda116bb7c4ccbeca

The topic of peaceful coexistence between religions and since ancient times has been of great importance in the growth and development of civilizations. Islamic religion has dealt with all races on the basis of the principle of honesty, love and tolerance away from superiority and arrogance. As Islam brought the Jews out of the persecution phase that had long held them, as well as the Muslims' respect for the Christian religion, as it guaranteed them their freedom Religious Since the beginning of the Islamic conquests, the evidence for that is the existence of many churches throughout the Islamic countries. Muslims have demonstrated a gentle and civilized behavior in dealing with these religions, and as a result, some of them embraced the Islamic religion, which adopted faithfulness as a criterion for differentiation between human beings. 
 
 
 
 
   It is worth noting that the need has become urgent in our present time to spread the principle of peaceful coexistence between religions as a result of the oppression and violation of human and human rights in societies. The Islamic religion has become, as is evident, a tolerant religion that rejects extremism in all its forms in order to ensure that all members of society live in an atmosphere of Love and intimacy.",2023.0,2023-03-17,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009d23f703da40ebd48fa225d7d5f400aa7ad04c

10.3390/eng4010043,The Importance of Assessing the Geological Site Effects of Ancient Earthquakes from the Archaeoseismological Point of View,"Earthquakes have and continue to, occur worldwide, though some places are affected more than others by earthquake-induced ground shaking and the same earthquake can cause more damage in one area than in nearby locations due to site-specific geological site conditions, also known as local site effects. Depending on the chronology of the earthquakes, various disciplines of seismology include instrumental and historical seismology, archaeoseismology, palaeoseismology and neotectonics, each focusing on using specific sources of information to evaluate recent or ancient earthquakes. Past earthquakes are investigated to expand the pre-instrumental and instrumental earthquake catalog and better evaluate a region’s seismic hazard. Archaeoseismology offers a way to achieve these goals because it links how ancient civilizations and their environment might have interacted and responded to past earthquake-induced ground motion and soil amplification. Hence, archaeoseismology explores pre-instrumental (past) earthquakes that might have affected sites of human occupation and their nearby settings, which have left their co-seismic marks in ancient manufactured constructions exhumed by archaeological excavations. However, archaeoseismological observations are often made on a limited epicentral area, poorly constrained dated earthquakes and occasionally on unclear evidence of earthquake damage. Archaeological excavations or field investigations often underestimate the critical role that an archaeological site’s ancient geological site conditions might have played in causing co-seismic structural damage to ancient anthropogenic structures. Nevertheless, the archaeological community might document and inaccurately diagnose structural damage by ancient earthquake shaking to structures and even estimate the size of past earthquakes giving little or no consideration to the role of geological site effects in addressing the causative earthquake. This mixture of factors frequently leads to imprecise estimates of the size of ancient earthquakes and unlikely earthquake environmental impacts, leaving unexplained the location and the moment magnitude of the causative earthquake. Hence, it is essential not to rely solely on earthquake intensities based on archaeologically documented co-seismic damage without assessing the nature of the observed structural damage and the contribution of the geological site effects. This paper explains the geological site effects concept to archaeologists unfamiliar with the notion. It clarifies its role in assessing ground shaking, soil amplification and earthquake intensity by past earthquakes and how and why the geological site effects can be estimated when a site is thought to have been struck by an earthquake. Hence, the geological site effects must be considered when archaeological excavations describe and interpret destruction layers. Conversely, engineers and seismologists dealing with seismic hazard risk assessment must pay close attention to archaeological investigations assessing earthquake intensities and locations based on field evidence of damage to structures attributed to past earthquakes, because the geological site effects might have been factored in inaccurately or not at all.",2023.0,2023-02-22,2,90,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00acc2424359c8e615f3060f52e99697c4a5a091

The era of Western domination and the spread of the ideas of the European Enlightenment, which lasted for several centuries, is coming to an end. Built on rational principles, the project of modernity supposed secularization of social life on the basis of the theory of natural human rights and the principles of the rule of law. But the slogan of the rule of law resulted in the etatization of social life and the destruction of traditional forms of social organization and communication. Under these conditions, Western society, experiencing a state of crisis, turns to the East and tries to find there other options for building a normative-value system of society. The aim of the article is to define the place of Fa (law, formal law) in the value-normative system of traditional Chinese worldview. The integral system of the main categories of ancient Chinese philosophy on the example of Taoism, Confucianism and Legalism doctrines is disclosed. The protective function of Fa in public life is substantiated. The author concludes that the statement in the normative system of Chinese society the value of values and patterns of behavior, oriented to the lofty principles of humanity and virtue, explains the preservation of Chinese civilization and its ability to develop.",2022.0,2022-11-23,0,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/016bdcff027f7eec07a5ec17ca8249f3d346e641

In this very fact location of women as female protagonists is very limited and obscure. Also, the initial instances show that they were treated as supporting characters. In this paper, I will try and highlight the roles of female characters in indigenous Bollywood and some popular literature also from the perspective of Ecofeminism. To understand Whether they were visible as facilitators of nature and ecology or they were seen exercising their agency through those characters or they are just objectified for publicity stunts in commercial films. This paper will also be touching upon the new age Cinema and theatre where some critiques are observing this as a contrasting effect of the past. From the beginning of civilization, whenever men needed support for livelihood and rule, women provided their helping hand. For instance, in ancient civilizations women were seen as gatherers, those who put together resources, nurture, and take care of them. But their clutch and agency are missing, when it comes to their social, political, and cultural sphere. This basically makes them a ‘choice-based’ role player, where both choice and role are not of their interest. There are several examples in our visual art-based Cinema i.e., Bollywood.

While the molecular biology of certain fungi naturally associated with vines and wines is well characterized, complementary investigations into the ecology of fungi associated with fruiting plants is largely lacking. DNA sequencing technologies allow the direct estimation of microbial diversity from a given sample, avoiding culture-based biases. Here, we use deep community pyrosequencing approaches, targeted at the 26S rRNA gene, to examine the richness and composition of fungal communities associated with grapevines and test for geographical community structure among four major regions in New Zealand (NZ). We find over 200 taxa using this approach, which is 10-fold more than previously recovered using culture-based methods. Our analyses allow us to reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity in fungal species richness and community composition across NZ and reveal significant differences between major areas.",2014.0,2014-04-22,154,62,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01ebf9db023bb9fd10e192ea6bcfef44112b2843

The spontaneously formed mythical, religious, moral and rational components of the worldview, as well as elements of philosophical doctrines are analyzed, traced as the unity of the notions of the gravity of sin and sinful behavior and even the community as a whole, caste character based on the idea of the inevitability of social inequality, the subordinate position of women, and significant differences in different legal systems, based on the specifics of economic structure and political system, civilizational and cultural differences, historical features of state formation, as well as worldviews of peoples, their understanding of the world, world order, natural and terrestrial laws. It is concluded that the general primary basis of the legal worldview of the peoples of the early states of the East are mythical and religious beliefs of peoples (as, incidentally, in all other early states), which served to explain the world order and justify the general laws of nature, and also served as a criterion for evaluating human actions.These ideas were based on common to all civilizations moral ideas about good and evil, justice and injustice, truth and injustice, moral and immoral. In philosophical treatises, in some literary and legal sources of the ancient East, one can find key common moral postulates that take long from the most ancient beliefs and religions and moral rules, known to science, and then reflected in Hinduism, Christianity, Islam. From the point of view of social and state ideology, the ruling elite was interested in spreading and affirming the notions of the sanctity and inviolability of the supreme power of rulers, who often combined religious and secular power. The laws of the rulers were also proclaimed by the commands of the gods, the highe rpowers, which must be strictly observed by all. This view of laws was reinforced by a system of severe punishments for violating them. Although this together helped to centralize the early states, to establish more effective protection against external enemies, and from the point of view of internal organization to keep the people firmly in subjection, it did not contribute to the development of ideals of individual freedom.",2021.0,2021-07-20,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0288df14957189ae6947602625c0f62df5d60cf1

We have many Myths within this civilization. Mythology is an important historical, religious, and cultural resource for any nation. It is even sacred history. The role of myths in the formation of national and cultural identity is very important because it helps to create awareness and a common sense of history, values, beliefs, sacredness and traditions. At the same time, myths become a means of expressing and preserving social memories and experiences within a nation. Myths help shape the identity of each individual in society.
A great researcher like Aziz Gardi, through his work on mythology, is a joint effort to revive the country and culture among every Kurdish individual. Our research entitled (The Role of Aziz Gardi in Translating the Myth of Nations into Kurdish), which relies on the descriptive analytical method, is an attempt to research the role and position of Aziz Gardi in reviving and paying attention to Myths in order to show different cultures. Our study consists of two parts.
The first part is a theoretical framework for concepts, which consists of several themes: Theme 1 Concepts and terms of myth, Theme 2 Concepts and terms of identity, Theme 3 Concepts and terms of culture, Theme 4 Works of Aziz Gardi in mythology.
The second part is myths and cultural identity, which consists of several themes: Theme 1 is Aziz Gardi's views on translation, Theme 2 is the role of myths in building religion, family, economy, power and authority.

This has resulted in the use of large number of medicinal plants with curative properties to treat various diseases. The use of medicinal plants as a source of relief from illness can be traced back to over five millennia to the written documents of the early civilization in China, India and the north east. Medicinal plants are relied upon by 80% of the world’s population and a number of plants have been documented for their biological and antimicrobial properties. Trema orientalis (Linn.) Blume enjoys wide spread distribution within savanna vegetation belts of sub Saharan Africa. Each specie grows to become a moderately tall tree with acceptable merchantable girth. The stem bark of T. orientalis contains Octacosanoic acid, 1-octacosanyl acetate, simiarenone, simiarenol, episimiarenol, and a new triterpene alcohol, trematol. The leaves contain tannins, saponins, flavanoids, triterpenoid (simiarenol, simiarenone, trematol). The tree has got various traditional medicinal uses in a wide range of cultures.

10.47818/drarch.2023.v4i3100,A timeless journey of strength and beauty: The potentials of the use of stone in architecture,"Use of stone in architecture has been an enduring and timeless tradition throughout history, withstanding the test of time from ancient civilizations to today’s architecture. The durability, versatility and aesthetic appeal of stone make it an exceptional material for creating striking architectural designs. Stone has been used for centuries, as an integral part of architecture since ancient times and its importance still holds true in contemporary architecture being a popular building material today. In this context, this study examines the key features of stone that make it such a vital material for architectural design by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of using stone for architecture. The paper examines the role of stone in architecture and explores how contemporary projects have utilized stone in innovative and creative ways also delves into the significance and beauty of stone architecture, highlighting its history, durability and aesthetic appeal. The research methodology includes the analysis of case studies of contemporary projects crafted from stone, examining the design process, materials and techniques used. The case studies analyzed in this paper demonstrate the versatility of stone in contemporary architecture. The projects showcase how stone can be used in innovative ways, including the creation of sculptural forms, the incorporation of technology and the utilization of sustainable materials. The paper argues that stone's timeless qualities, durability and versatility make it an ideal material for contemporary architecture, particularly in achieving sustainability and aesthetic appeal.

During this period, the early urban agricultural Sapalli culture, where the contacts of the two traditions were reflected not only in material but also in spiritual culture, developed and functioned on the territory of the south of modern Uzbekistan. Based on the results of studies of the burial grounds of Bustan VI–VII, the first-time attempt to verify the funeral rite with the written sources of the ancient Indo-Aryans and Indo-Iranians was made in the present work. The chosen approach made it possible to solve simultaneously several problems: to clarify the path of advancement of the Indo-Aryan tribes to India; trace one of the ideological foundations of the formation of the Bactrian civilization; illustrate the impact on the local environment of the steppe ethnos represented by the Andronovo population, identified with the Indo-Aryans. The results of the realized work allow us to speak about the significant presence of the Aryan tradition in Sapalli society and the emergence of new forms of funeral rituals. The changed mythological and ritual statements in cosmogonic representations have established as their main constant the maintenance of universal balance and order, carried out through a system of sacrifices, the highest of which at the final stage of life was a person.",2023.0,2023-09-30,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/033b87abe38b647739063c9d6abfa0e4789cb3b4

Following their abandonment, the remains of the medieval settlements progressively deteriorated in their ruined condition, becoming ghost villages often made of sparse portions of buildings, traces of outer walls, and isolated vestiges of ancient monuments colonized by vegetation. Five cases of central Apennine abandoned villages in the Abruzzi region (Frattura, Sperone, Albe, Salle, and Gessopalena) were investigated, combining information on the local adverse geological conditions with the historical reconstruction of their abandonment and resettlement, based on archive documents from the 19th and 20th centuries. The history of these localities was conditioned by two strong earthquakes that struck the Abruzzi region in 1915 (magnitude 7.1) and 1933 (magnitude 5.9), and by slope instability. In all cases, abandonment and resettlement produced new villages against the background of ancient ruins and remains. In conclusion, the paper discusses the potential use of the material traces of local histories with educational aims.

10.5539/JPL.V12N3P34,"Theoretical Issues of ""Security"" Concept","The development of ideas about the category of ""security"" has come a long way, correlated with the development of human civilization. Initially conceived as a biological reaction, aimed at one’s own life preservation from the all-encompassing world danger for the ancient man, security moves from the category of biological reaction to the category of the thinking process with the development of mental activity, reflecting not only the response to the preservation of life, but also the anticipation of threat appearance danger. According to the authors, the qualitative transition of security comprehension from everyday life and practicality to the scientific aspect takes place at the turn of the 16th-17th centuries due to the rapid development of science and technology during this period of time. The scientific interest in the formal-logical interpretation of security understanding and the desire to develop appropriate terminology that adequately reflects the essence of security is especially evident in the philosophy by F. Bacon and B. Spinoza. However, neither during this period, nor during subsequent periods, the science has developed an established (academic) concept of security. The existing numerous concepts of security are nothing more than empirical in nature and reflect not the essence of security phenomenon, but the person’s subjective perceptions of it.",2019.0,2019-07-23,3,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0358003bbe5e2a842cc22a4897a17e2df91cb2c0

Astrolabe is an ingenious astronomical instrument which was created both to observe and calculate the coordinates of celestial objects such as stars and planets thousands of years ago. However, various creations of modern instruments made astrolabe to be considered as inaccurate and eventually getting forgotten. Thus, this study attempts to analyses the data of sun’s altitude during transit obtained by astrolabe. This is a qualitative study with technical features by adopting document analysis, observation, and comparison analysis approaches. The data analysis process has been conducted by comparing the data obtained by astrolabe and the official data retrieved from Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (JUPEM). The finding shows that astrolabe can be used both for observation and calculation purposes and it is still relevant for today's use. This study is quite important to be carried out to create awareness on the importance of ancient astronomical instruments and at the same time to commemorate the golden ages of the Islamic civilization which incorporated hundreds of years of Islamic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",2023.0,2023-02-09,0,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/038bce856c14215e0701da6f50bad22a50ba864c

Many plants that contain RIPs are listed in the pharmacopoeias of folk medicine all over the world, mostly because of their toxicity. This review analyses the position occupied in traditional medicine by plants from which RIPs have been isolated. The overview starts from the antique age of the Mediterranean area with ancient Egypt, followed by the Greek and Roman classic period. Then, the ancient oriental civilizations of China and India are evaluated. More recently, Unani medicine and European folk medicine are examined. Finally, the African and American folk medicines are taken into consideration. In conclusion, a list of RIP-expressing plants, which have been used in folk medicine, is provided with the geographical distribution and the prescriptions that are recommended by traditional healers.

10.1101/2023.09.19.558506,Manifesto of Transparent Mathematical Modeling: From Ecology to General Science,"Mathematical black box models, which hide the structure and behavior of the subsystems, currently dominate science. Errors and paradoxes, such as the biodiversity paradox and the limiting similarity hypothesis, often arise from subjective interpretations of these hidden mechanisms. To address these problems, we have developed transparent mathematical models of the white box type. Here we justify the hypothesis that transparent mathematical models of the white box type can be built by means of logical deterministic cellular automata whose rules are based on the general theory of the corresponding domain. Using white box models, we were able to directly identify the mechanisms of interspecific competition, test the principle of competitive exclusion and the hypothesis of limiting similarity, resolve the paradox of biodiversity, and formulate for the first time the general principle of competitive coexistence. As a basis for reproducing and further developing the method, we present two transparent mathematical models of an ecosystem with one and two competing species. C++ code for our models provided. Cellular automata thinking can be traced back from ancient cellular board games in the histories of all civilizations. The transparent mathematical modeling opens a rational approach to ensuring the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of automatic decisions.

The ancient Egyptians perfectly balanced work and leisure, which had a positive impact on their health; their overall wellbeing is largely reflected on the level of civilizational superiority. Nevertheless, experiencing negative emotions, head injuries, or other physical problems was inevitable, which was adversely reflected on the psychological and mental health of the individuals. This study deals with a selection of disorders and diseases (Depression, Epilepsy, Paraphilia, Dementia, and Hysteria).

10.18863/pgy.1321465,"Hipnoza Multidisipliner Yaklaşım: Psikiyatrik Temeli, Nörogörüntüleme ve Genetik Bulgular","Hypnosis, a practice often misunderstood and surrounded by misconceptions, has a rich historical lineage dating back to ancient civilizations. Our review explores the relationship between neuroanatomy, genetics, and hypnotic susceptibility, investigating organic factors influencing an individual's responsiveness to hypnosis. This review highlights the importance of hypnosis as a high-level cognitive activity, especially in pain and anxiety management, and emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating hypnosis into healthcare practices. Recent advancements in neuroimaging have provided insights into the neurological mechanisms of hypnosis, while genetic research has expanded its applications. However, persistent misconceptions hinder its acceptance. This article offers a multidisciplinary basic exploration of hypnosis, focusing on its origins, historical development related to psychiatry, the basic neuroimaging findings mainly affecting the limbic system responsible for emotion, and genetic underpinnings. We aim to inspire clinicians, social scientists, and healthcare professionals to effectively integrate the scientific basics of hypnosis into therapeutic practice, contributing to a better understanding of its role in augmenting outcomes.",2023.0,2023-12-01,0,90,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0456502890bd0a23b7492b7b7b7fb9b5bf1db7ce

10.3390/fermentation5040096,Bioprospecting for Bioactive Peptide Production by Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from Fermented Dairy Food,"With rapidly ageing populations, the world is experiencing unsustainable healthcare from chronic diseases such as metabolic, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and cancer disorders. Healthy diet and lifestyle might contribute to prevent these diseases and potentially enhance health outcomes in patients during and after therapy. Fermented dairy foods (FDFs) found their origin concurrently with human civilization for increasing milk shelf-life and enhancing sensorial attributes. Although the probiotic concept has been developed more recently, FDFs, such as milks and yoghurt, have been unconsciously associated with health-promoting effects since ancient times. These health benefits rely not only on the occurrence of fermentation-associated live microbes (mainly lactic acid bacteria; LAB), but also on the pro-health molecules (PHMs) mostly derived from microbial conversion of food compounds. Therefore, there is a renaissance of interest toward traditional fermented food as a reservoir of novel microbes producing PHMs, and “hyperfoods” can be tailored to deliver these healthy molecules to humans. In FDFs, the main PHMs are bioactive peptides (BPs) released from milk proteins by microbial proteolysis. BPs display a pattern of biofunctions such as anti-hypertensive, antioxidant, immuno-modulatory, and anti-microbial activities. Here, we summarized the BPs most frequently encountered in dairy food and their biological activities; we reviewed the main studies exploring the potential of dairy microbiota to release BPs; and delineated the main effectors of the proteolytic LAB systems responsible for BPs release.",2019.0,2019-11-05,70,275,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0472f23e088c1b700b70d040b6eae8f032c1e91c

10.21659/cjad.81.v8n105,From Tradition to Transformation: Exploring Broto Folk Art of Bengal,"Symbolic patterns and religious motifs are commonplace in Indian folk-art traditions such as in Broto Folk art, where floor design patterns were practised as a ritual relevant to the issues prayed to for well-being. As the designs responded to the shifting trends in society have impacted the motifs throughout time, and efforts to preserve and promote resulted in a cumulative action by artists as paintings or decorative art pieces. Broto Folk art, one of the oldest indigenous crafts from India, has been a testimony to the evolving times of history. Often linked by its roots to the Indus Valley Civilization, this ancient craft- its motifs, patterns and design can be studied to explore the thematic representation of time. Through analysis of the designs from various times in history, much information can be uncovered about the lifestyles, and aspirations of the people at the time and society. Using motifs, floor arts such as Broto folk art reflect the aspirations of society at the time. To mirror the aesthetic aspirations of the populace in the present times, contemporary social practices ought to dictate floor designs. An analysis of the materials, symbolism, and hues of a work of art can provide insights into the culture where it was created. As a result of the shifting social dynamics, aspirations have also evolved, impacting the motifs and designs utilised to portray the same. Considering the evolving lifestyle and societal value systems, this study examines the thematic representation of society in Broto Folk art designs via interviews with a group of selected folk artists and surveys.",2024.0,2024-04-30,0,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/047eb85d7e1b0fa1bd46842d109b83851e48ba97

Kaş has witnessed ancient civilizations and has countless remains that are waiting to be found and understood. The main objective of this research is to reveal these ancient remains and make them a part of the academic literature. When they have become acknowledged and mapped, a guideline could be provided for preserving and managing our heritages. Since prehistoric times, humans have been using Earth’s water for transportation, nutrition, and trade. Due to the relationship between human and water, people have overcome far distances and cultures become able to interact with each other. Since water covers the seventy-one percent of the world, excluding underwater while studying cultural landscapes, would be ignoring an extensive piece of the whole. Kaş was selected as research area because its culture and interaction with sea dates backs to prehistoric times. The chosen sites include the dive sites located in the central area and nearby islands. First, the history, geography and the importance of Kaş were researched. Preliminary survey maps formed with reference to underwater topography, currents, prevailing winds, and refuge locations for vessels. Thereafter, carefully planned dives were followed through. Within the extent of research, the findings and artifacts are documented and marked with their exact coordinates on an underwater map. Finally, the research is moved forward with studying protection and managing underwater cultural landscapes and conclusions have been made for Kaş.",2019.0,,0,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04c8fe69b17f46e8da5b96d00bd37d95564790a4

The aim of this study is to assess how common certain intestinal parasites were in China and Korea in the past 2000 years, and make comparisons with prevalence data from the 20th century. This allows us to go on to investigate how and why changes in parasite prevalence may have occurred at different times. Here we show that Chinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis) dropped markedly in prevalence in both Korea and China earlier than did roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) and whipworm (Trichuris trichiura).

Most of the Earth’s liquid fresh water is found, not in lakes and rivers, but is stored underground in aquifers. Tourism plays a significant role in the redevelopment of urban waterfronts. (Nguyen, 2010) Stated, there is no doubt that recreation and tourism can be used as catalysts for waterfront redevelopment. Many cities have developed from, and are located near, the waterside. The four ancient civilizations originated at riversides, because of the convenient water supply for drinking and irrigation, transport, and many other benefits.

10.3390/biology9120484,A Descriptive Overview of the Medical Uses Given to Mentha Aromatic Herbs throughout History,"Simple Summary Mints are aromatic herbs with a millenary tradition of use for diverse medicinal purposes since ancient civilizations, and they are still presently used in different clinical practices. Mints have been used since ancient Babylon, but it was in Classical Antiquity that their medical uses flourished, with major contributions from Pliny the Elder. In the Middle Ages, the increased knowledge surrounding mints came from Byzantine physicians, while, in the Modern Age, technological developments allowed the production of mint-based products, such as extracts and essential oils, which have become part of elaborate galenic formulas employed by an increasing number of physicians, and have also stimulated both scientific and artistic interests alike. In present-day medicine, several mints and mint-based products are being researched as potential therapeutic alternatives for many diseases, while also being vastly employed in food and cosmetic industries. Abstract Mints have been among the most widely used herbs for medicinal purposes since ancient civilizations. They are still presently used for numerous purposes, including non-medicinal, which makes them economically relevant herbs. Information regarding the medical and scientific uses given to mints throughout history are vastly scattered and/or incomplete. The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive descriptive overview of the medical uses given to these herbs, highlighting both the authors in medical culture responsible for their dissemination, as well as their major galenic formulations. Databases on medical science, reference textbooks on medical history, botanics (aromatic herbs), and pharmacognosy were consulted. The use of mints remotes to Classical Antiquity, with major contributions from Pliny the Elder.

Among these philosophies, the philosophy of leadership is the most prominent in Javanese society. This is not surprising, because the Javanese people have had considerable leadership dominance since ancient times. Javanese leaders often use philosophy as the basis or guidance for their leadership (Santoso, 2010: 67). Javanese culture has strong local wisdom in the field of leadership. Leadership is something that gets high attention considering that this is tied to ideal values that are not only oriented to the world alone. This assumption is reflected in the traditional view that considers the leader to be the ruler as well as the “representative/incarnation” of the god (God's representative). This sacredness gives a big responsibility to create harmony between humans, nature, and God (Kurniawan, 2019: 198).",2021.0,,0,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06c31d29fec869e8f1bffa636bd56cb799a4fe7b

10.29121/shodhkosh.v5.i1.2024.882,A STUDY OF THE ARTISTIC TRADITION OF ELEGANT TOYS OF INDUS VALLY CIVILIZATION,"In ancient time the main purpose of sports was to attain entertainment whether they being peaceful domestic games or wild games. Beside entertainment games were also a medium of mutual interaction and lead to stress free life. According to Macdaugal “Games and Sports are important for the Security, development and growth of the individual”. Games and Sports is an integral part of our culture through which man has been strengthening the social relations. Games and Sports have been a means of physical, mental as well as cultural development. Through sports the culture and knowledge have been imparted to the future generations. The Games and Sports have been accepted all over the world as the best medium for physical strength and mental development.If we look at the history of the origin of the sports, we found it remains from prehistoric times. According to some written documents, it started with the emergence of great civilizations lie Greece, Egypt, and Indus Valley. Reference to sports in India is also mention in Vedas and various Literatures. In 1921-22 AD two important cities of Indus Valley Harappa and Mohanjo-daro was discovered by John Marshall, this civilization was the center of Art and Culture. Archeological excavations at Harappa and Mohanjo-daro show that people were involved in some kind of physical activity. The people used to play many types of games using stones, balls, and dice. Various types of toys have been found in the excavation which were made of copper, ivory, and baked clay. Some of the toys were extremely skillfully made and decorated. The toys and Statues of Indus Valley were made by the pinching method in clay in which the clay is pressed by hands to give its perfect shape and then strengthen by baking in furnace. The interest of Indus People towards sports is known from these artistic remains also the skill on the artist who creates these toys which reflect the social perspective and mental outlook of that time.

Since that date of early basic literacy of human history, B.C pioneers, philosophers, leaderships and professionals exerted every efforts to advance their local environments in politics, state identity, public administration, urban centers, culture and faith, education, innovative thoughts and arts, and civic daily life. Consequently, B.C significant ancient states and civilizations arose and flourished into world sovereign empires, exceeding in several fields their contemporary counterparts the so-called “Big Powers” in the 21st century A.C. Even these “Big Powers” proved helpless in resisting the invisible virus “Corona”, which caused the death of hundreds of thousands of persons, and is threatening millions of others in facing health problems or termination later. The status of world states (powerful or marginal) is determined by the quality of its educational systems. Further, the future of civic and productive students as adults is dependent upon the rigor of schooling methodologies, which encompass: learners who are dedicated to learn; teachers who guide and teach; peers who are collaborative learning partners; curricula, which are served by textbooks and material in the classrooms; methods, techniques and technologies as communicative tools of education and management messages; and school environments, which physically host most education factors, processes and services. Hence, this research article examined the educational methodologies cumulative from BC Sophists to the ICTs revolution at 2000+ A.C. a Comparative analytic review was conducted to specify the advances and setbacks accrued during the extended 500B.C-2000+A.C years in the lives of generations as future crucial professional, leaderships and pioneer assets of society.",2020.0,2020-06-16,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07cd25ed27d3257eee4c25705c5ecaedc5865295

A Geoinformatics–Based Approach in Henan, Central China","In the context of ecological civilization construction in China, interregional ancient trees are important natural and cultural resources, and it is vital that they are effectively protected and utilized according to their spatial distribution and regional conditions in order to provide a balance between local economic development and the ecological environment. This article analyzes the spatial heterogeneity of 26,842 ancient trees and explores the underlying natural and human factors by using geoinformatics–based techniques (i.e., the nearest neighbor index, kernel density, spatial autocorrelation, and the geographically weighted regression model) in Henan Province, Central China. The research findings conclude that: (1) The interregional ancient trees show positive spatial autocorrelation, and the aggregation effect in Western Henan is the most significant. (2) The growing environment and elevation exert a more obvious influence on the spatial pattern of interregional ancient trees. (3) The main influencing factors per region are different, for example, historical culture in Western Henan, water source and elevation in Southern Henan, and the growing environment in Eastern Henan, while ancient trees in Northern Henan have a weak relationship with each factor.

They encapsulate the most vibrant, unified, and thought-provoking aspects of humanistic and historical intricacies within traditional cultures, serving as foundational elements that contribute to the manifestation of unique national cultures. Every individual globally possesses a distinct surname and given name.The space Chinese, Vietnamese, and English systems of surnames intricately intertwine with their corresponding national histories, religious beliefs, traditional cultures, and social customs. These systems distinctly reflect the images and evolution of their social histories, the origins and progression of ancient civilizations, the amalgamation and enrichment of Chinese, Vietnamese, and English societies, as well as the transformations and reforms in social norms. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights for delving into the histories and cultures of these nations. Chinese, Vietnamese, and English surnames have undergone evolution within two disparate social environments, enduring extensive periods of historical refinement and accrual. They manifest various cultural idiosyncrasies, emanating distinctive historical allure, spotlighting individual national traits, and revealing diverse valuable orientations and aesthetic standards. This thesis delves into the concepts and connotations of Chinese, Vietnamese, and English surnames. On one hand, it scrutinizes and dissects differences in their formation times, historical origins, developmental trajectories, cultural characteristics, national amalgamation, and cultural connotations. On the other hand, it aims to identify primary factors arising from social reforms, religious beliefs, national psychologies, valuable conceptions, and political and economic elements. The study explores the semantic significance of surnames, uncovering variations in Chinese, Vietnamese, and English histories and cultures while nurturing cross-cultural awareness. The examination of historical and cultural differences in Chinese, Vietnamese, and English surnames proves valuable in acknowledging both shared traits and unique distinctions in cultural customs, facilitating a more profound understanding of societal development. The analysis of these differences in cross-cultural communication is essential, serving as a pivotal means for expanding cultural awareness in Chinese, Vietnamese, and English contexts.

10.3390/land14030619,"Water Supply Systems: Past, Present Challenges, and Future Sustainability Prospects","At the beginning of human history, surface water, especially from rivers and springs, was the most frequent water supply source. Groundwater was used in arid and semi-arid regions, e.g., eastern Crete (Greece). As the population increased, periodic water shortages occurred, which led to the development of sophisticated hydraulic structures for water transfer and for the collection and storage of rainwater, as seen, for example, in Early Minoan times (ca 3200–2100 BC). Water supply and urban planning had always been essentially related: the urban water supply systems that existed in Greece since the Bronze Age (ca 3200–1100 BC) were notably advanced, well organized, and operable. Water supply systems evolved considerably during the Classical and Hellenistic periods (ca 480–31 BC) and during the Roman period (ca 31 BC–480 AD). Also, early Indian society was an amazing vanguard of technology, planning, and vision, which significantly impacted India’s architectural and cultural heritage, thus laying the foundation for sustainable urban living and water resource management. In ancient Egypt, the main source of freshwater was the Nile River; Nile water was conveyed by open and closed canals to supply water to cities, temples, and fields. Underground stone-built aqueducts supplied Nile water to so-called Nile chambers in temples. The evolution of water supply and urban planning approaches from ancient simple systems to complex modern networks demonstrates the ingenuity and resilience of human communities. Many lessons can be learned from studying traditional water supply systems, which could be re-considered for today’s urban sustainable development. By digging into history, measures for overcoming modern problems can be found. Rainwater harvesting, establishing settlements in proximity of water sources to facilitate access to water, planning, and adequate drainage facilities were the characteristics of ancient civilizations since the ancient Egyptian, Minoan, Mohenjo-Daro, Mesopotamian, and Roman eras, which can still be adopted for sustainability.

Abstract:
 The Andalusian experience represented a unique and exceptional Islamic and human experiment in the civilizational management of communal living among adherents of the three heavenly religions. The Islamic conquest of Al-Andalus was an exceptionally humane and civilizational conquest, liberating the Iberian Peninsula from religious and political persecution, economic exploitation, and social oppression under the Catholic Visigothic regime. It transitioned into a new era, a new civilizational experience under Islam, spanning eight centuries. Throughout this period, all segments of Andalusian society, its sects, and races enjoyed various rights and freedoms ensured by Islamic law, characterized by moderation, tolerance, acceptance of diversity, and pluralism.
The cohabitation, coexistence, intermingling, and harmony between Muslims, Christians, and Jews were secrets to societal peace and the cultural brilliance of Andalusian society, encompassing its various ethnic and religious components. This coexistence and interaction manifested in all spheres of political, social, religious, intellectual, and economic life, from the embryonic moments of the Islamic conquest, continuing to evolve and flourish through the eras of the Islamic state in Andalusia. Individuals from diverse religions and races, including Muslims, Christians, Jews, Arabs, Berbers, Iberians, Sub-Saharan Africans, and others, contributed to building Andalusian civilization and achieving its scientific, intellectual, political, economic, and social accomplishments. This was due to the remarkable religious and civilizational tolerance exhibited by Islamic rule in Andalusia, astonishing both ancient and contemporary observers alike.
Therefore, the experience of religious and civilizational cohabitation in Andalusia remains a worthy and sustainable civilization to consider in guiding humanity towards a secure future built on the values of coexistence and tolerance, not on the values of hatred and aggression.",2024.0,2024-05-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/097d25ebf159d9830a6c6d191fee43c8747dcbe7

Since ancient century Chanakya in a very famous treatise Arthasastra emphasized the importance of diplomacy and efforts to build up the strength of a country. This paper aims to examine the Arthasastra text as the basis of the Defense Diplomacy strategy. Indonesia adopted a Sanskrit slogan in the military world which indicated the close relationship of Indonesian defense and the treasury of Asian civilization with the influence of Indian text. Chanakya asserted, the state must build defense, ready to fight but can maintain peace. A country is deemed to be authoritative so that other countries either with a hostile tendency or as partners, will have high respect. Nevertheless, Arthasastra insists the supreme goal of a country is to build prosperity with defense and security as a prerequisite to build prosperity for a country.",2018.0,2018-11-02,6,12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/099851d730b791078fdc65de572c22c750c29b84

10.1111/j.1559-3584.1997.tb03200.x,Author's response—I,"1. One of the basic observation in my article was that the early establishment of mental hospitals in the Indian subcontinent reflected2 the need and demand of ‘European patients’ and to manage and treat Englishmen and Indian Sepoyees employed by the British East India Company . The location of the first hospitals, were in proximity , where the battles were fought. 2. Secondly, his view that ‘Indian civilization and Ayurveda’ is not antedated but ‘post-Alexander’ and is a product of Greek civilization is possibly based on the source of his information and probably based on colonialistic viewpoint. The study of history is not simply a restoration of the past events but is also its proper evaluation in a most objective manner. This is a challenging task, as there is no authentic source book of ancient Indian civilization. We greatly depend on the observations written by western writers, guided by different approaches, viz. (a) the orientalist, viewpoint, (b) the administrative perceptions, and (c) the missionary writers approach, and also (d) by communist writers’ perception. Any objective reconstruction of the history of civilization may take different paths and different conclusions. This viewpoint is beautifully illustrated by the two radically different forms taken by two group of writers are: one, the History of mankind published by UNESCO and second the series published by the Columbia University Press under the title Introduction to Oriental Civilizations. The Ayurveda is believed to be upveda or a branch of Atharvaveda, in this we find ample references to the medicine, principles of treatment and descriptions of the different parts and organs of the human body, and the time is calculated as one to two thousand years before Christ. The exact time of Atreya and Sushruta who contributed richly to Ayurveda can not be definitely fixed in the absence of necessary evidence but there is a general inference that Atreya belonged to the 6th or 7th century BC. These periods are agreed to, as there is material available for fixing the time of Lord Buddha, who was born in 557 BC and in the literature of that time there is reference to two great Indian universities one at Kasi and another in Takshashila where Ayurveda was taught. This helps us to fix the time of Ayurveda. 3. Thirdly, there is rich evidence regarding the multitude of psychotherapeutic theories and practices, in vogue in ancient India. Due to paucity of space, I would mention only about Mantra vidya. Mantra vidya is a major , selfsufficient and independent method of Indian psychotherapy and it is one of the oldest methods. Mantra is related to manas or mind. Mantra may be in the form of coherent words or single letters, arranged in a certain order . It is not only a conjoined word but a particular sound body of consciousness with a definite meaning and energy in itself. According to some, it is the sound body, a power charged with the intense vibrations of the spiritual personality of the creator or the seer of the mantra. This therapy is in usage since vedic times and is a valuable tool, which is practiced widely in India. Mantra are of two types • Vedic mantra and • Tantric mantra The vedic mantras are older and derived from vedas are longer and have a meaning while tantric mantras are of later origin and are used for japa (repetition) and for keeping with oneself in the form of yantra. 4.

10.1177/18344909231194854,China's collectivist cosmopolitanism: Harmony and conflict with Western conceptualizations of cosmopolitanism rooted in individualistic notions of human rights,"Just as leading Western countries have begun withdrawing from the neoliberal Washington Consensus that paved the way for economic globalization over the last 40 years, China has proposed an ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, or One Belt One Road, outlining its vision for global development. President Xi's vision of collectivist cosmopolitanism is centered on the principle of sovereign equality between nations, emphasizing civilizational uniqueness rather than universal human rights. In this view, economic and social development are path dependent, and in China's case, prioritize decolonization and national sovereignty. Xi's view in major speeches is cosmopolitan but collectivist, emphasizing economic growth, openness, dynamism, and an “avowed respect” for the integrity of other cultures, while saying nothing about individual human rights or groups within China. This approach positions ancient Chinese traditions like Confucianism as playing a central role in cultivating individuals’ and society's moral qualities so that person, society, and governance are bound together as a mutually beneficial and interconnected whole. It forms the theoretical basis of a Chinese view of cosmopolitanism, which could be the basis of dialogue with Western cosmopolitanists. The challenge is reconciling the different emphasis accorded to human rights versus national sovereignty in the two views. Empirical results of a new measure of Cosmopolitan Orientation that correlates positively rather than negatively with nationalism and religiosity provide insights into the specific basis for this dialogue to become beneficial rather than conflictual.",2023.0,2023-01-01,7,85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b287e873dba982ce15bfdbd1e09a406c0de8332

10.3390/biology12010076,Germplasm Resources of Oaks (Quercus L.) in China: Utilization and Prospects,"Simple Summary Oaks (Quercus spp.) are a major component of subtropical and temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere. There are approximately 464 species, and they are dominant tree species in ecosystems. Oaks have a long history of cultivation in Europe, North America, and other continents. They are also cultivated and distributed in most provinces of China. In this paper, Quercus germplasm resource distribution, ecological adaptability, and utilization are explored. All evidence indicates that oaks have been widely distributed since ancient times and have greater functional value than other species in the Fagaceae family. This review will provide a deeper understanding of oak conservation, development, and utilization in China. Abstract Oaks exhibit unique biological characteristics and high adaptability to complex climatic and soil conditions. They are widely distributed across various regions, spanning 40 degrees latitude and 75 degrees longitude. The total area of oak forest in China is 16.72 million hm2. There are 60 lineages of Quercus in China, including 49 species, seven varieties, and four subgenera. Archaeological data indicate that oaks were already widely distributed in ancient times, and they are dominant trees in vast regions of China’s forests. In addition, the acorn was an important food for ancestral humans, and it has accompanied human civilization since the early Paleolithic. Diverse oak species are widely distributed and have great functional value, such as for greening, carbon sequestration, industrial and medicinal uses, and insect rearing. Long-term deforestation, fire, diseases, and pests have led to a continuous decline in oak resources. This study discusses the Quercus species and their distribution in China, ecological adaptation, and the threats facing the propagation and growth of oaks in a changing world. This will give us a better understanding of Quercus resources, and provide guidance on how to protect and better utilize germplasm resources in China. The breeding of new varieties, pest control, and chemical and molecular research also need to be strengthened in future studies.",2022.0,2022-12-31,12,115,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b3d1b2c7b22b7a4c8d7a889757496a6ad4988e2

Despite their widespread use and importance in modern society, silica glasses with complex geometries are only fabricated in automated processes using 3D printing. Here, the volumetric printing of silica‐based glasses with tunable multimaterial and microstructural control is reported. Volumetric printing enables complex shaping of photo‐reactive resins in a few seconds using illumination techniques analogous to those employed for medical imaging. Particle‐filled and phase‐separating resins are used as photo‐reactive feedstock that is quickly printed in 3D and subsequently converted into silica glasses through conventional heat treatment. Using rheology and imaging techniques, it is shown that the design of the resin is crucial to print complex geometries with high shape fidelity. The capabilities of the printing platform are demonstrated by fabricating a silica‐based filtration device combining dense and porous glass with tunable compositions in a unique 3D structure.",2024.0,2024-02-21,4,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0bbbb240088bef4616b2a977d5c59437d08387e4

10.3390/W13081069,"Roman Aqueducts in Crete, Greece: Learning from the Past","The Romans were well aware of the strategic importance of Crete and tried, by any means possible, its final conquest. The island was under Roman rule over four centuries (ca 67 BC–330 AD). Under Roman rule, Crete witnessed a growth of its population and prosperity and an increase in its connectivity with other parts of the Empire. In addition, Gortys, Chersonisos, Elyros, Lyttos, Kissamos and other cities flourished under their rule. At that prosperous time, several luxurious infrastructures, such as hydraulic works, were developed. In this paper, we wish to examine the principles and the technical characteristics of major aqueducts built at that time. They constructed impressive hydro-works, such as aqueducts, by using the knowledge gained from earlier Greek civilizations in Minoan and Classical and Hellenistic times. However, they mainly increased the scale of applied technologies to support the increased population water demand. Water is a common need of humankind and several ancient civilizations developed simple but practical techniques, such as the aqueduct, especially during Roman times. We can gain from their experience and knowledge to develop a sustainable water supply, presently and in the future, both in developed and developing countries.",2021.0,2021-04-13,5,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c2fb49bf6b1b651623d5109663038d6267f2edd

10.3389/fneur.2024.1404720,Human senses and sensors from Aristotle to the present,"This historical review on the semantic evolution of human senses and sensors revealed that Aristotle’s list of the five senses sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell is still in use among non-scientific lay persons. It is no surprise that his classification in the work “De Anima” (On the Soul) from 350 BC confuses the sensor “touch” with the now more comprehensively defined somatosensory system and that senses are missing such as the later discovered vestibular system and the musculotendinous proprioception of the position of parts of the body in space. However, it is surprising that in the three most influential ancient cultures, Egypt, Greece, and China—which shaped the history of civilization—the concept prevailed that the heart rather than the brain processes perception, cognition, and emotions. This “cardiocentric view” can be traced back to the “Doctrine of Aristotle,” the “Book of the Dead” in ancient Egypt, and the traditional Chinese medicine of correspondence documented in the book “Huang di Neijing.” In Greek antiquity the philosophers Empedocles, Democritus and Aristotle were proponents of the allocation of the spirit and the soul to the heart connected to the body via the blood vessels. Opponents were the pre-Socratic mathematician Pythagoras, the philosopher Plato, and especially the Greek physician Hippocrates who regarded the brain as the most powerful organ in humans in his work “De Morbo Sacro.” The Greek physician Galen of Pergamon further elaborated on the concept of the brain (“cephalocentric hypothesis”) connected to the body by a network of nerves. The fundamental concepts for understanding functions and disorders of the vestibular system, the perception of self-motion, verticality and balance control were laid by a remarkable group of 19th century scientists including Purkynӗ, Mach, Breuer, Helmholtz, and Crum-Brown. It was also in the 19th century that Bell described a new sense of a reciprocal sensorimotor loop between the brain and the muscles which he called “muscular sense,” later termed “kinaesthesia” by Bastian and defined in 1906 as “proprioception” by Sherrington as “the perception of joint and body movements as well as position of the body or body segments, in space.” Both, the vestibular system and proprioception could be acknowledged as senses six or seven. However, we hesitate to recommend “pain”—which is variously assigned to the somatosensory system or extero-, intero-, visceroception—as a separate sensory system. Pain sensors are often not specific but have multisensory functions. Because of this inconsistent, partly contradictory classification even by experts in the current literature on senses and sensors we consider it justified to recommend a comprehensive reorganization of classification features according to the present state of knowledge with an expansion of the number of senses. Such a project has also to include the frequent task-dependent multisensory interactions for perceptual and sensorimotor achievements, and higher functions or disorders of the visual and vestibular systems as soon as cognition or emotions come into play. This requires a cooperation of sensory physiologists, neuroscientists and experienced physicians involved in the management of patients with sensory and multisensory disorders.",2024.0,2024-07-03,1,69,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cc13268215912e28ad20870ee788a595c562324

10.4103/0253-7613.174587,Cytotoxic activity of a glaucoside from Eugenia jambolana against MCF-7 cells,"99 Indian Journal of Pharmacology | February 2016 | Vol 48 | Issue 1 Sir, Breast cancer, as a chronic disease, is a commonly identified cancer in female in both economically developed and developing countries.[1] There are various treatments approaches that have been aimed toward treatment of this disease, but the success rate of the chemotherapeutic drugs are reported to be low; with high rate of recurrence and various side effects. Natural compounds or dietary agents have been used as an important tool to treat cancer because of its low cytotoxicity and less adverse effects. Breast cancer can metastasize to lymph nodes and distant organs from the primary site which is usually the cause of death. Plants and natural products play an important role in medicine and provide important prototypes for the development of novel drugs.[2] They offer a valuable source of compounds with a wide variety of biological activities and chemical structures. Many anticancer agents have been derived from natural sources; directly as pure native compounds, or as semi-synthetic analogs.[3-5] Since the dawn of civilization, herbal drugs have been used in the ancient civilizations and their use in the treatment of cancer is on a rise, especially in the developing and underdeveloped countries primarily due to its easy affordability, nontoxic nature, easy acceptability, less toxic or no toxic effects, and easy availability. Among the several plants reported to possess anticancer activity, Eugenia jambolana is one among the many plants, which has not been investigated for anticancer activity. The present study proves the traditional claims of the plant against cancer.[6] The berries have been reported to possess activity against breast cancer.[7] This paper will possibly help to bridge between traditional claims and modern therapy on E. jambolana. This paper reports the isolation, structure determination and biological activities of a steroidal saponin, glaucoside J. Spectral data led to the structure of the compound as 5,6‐dihydroxy‐3‐ [(4‐hydroxy‐6‐(hydroxymethyl) ‐ 3 , 5 ‐ d i [ 3 , 4 , 5 ‐ t r i h y d r o x y ‐ 6 ‐ ( h y d r o x y m e t h y l ) tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyl] oxytetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyl) oxy]-2-methoxy-10, 13-dimethylperhydro cyclopenta[α] phenanthren-17-yl (phenyl) methylacetate from E. jambolana seeds. Saponins are natural glycosides which possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. The MTT assay was performed according to the method set out by Mosmann. Jambosine, gallic acid, ellagic acid, corilagin, 3,6-hexahydroxydiphenoylglucose, 1-galloylglucose, 3-galloylglucose, quercetin, -sitosterol, and 4,6 hexahydroxydiphenoylglucose are a few bioactive compounds isolated and identified from E. jambolana. In this work, glaucoside (compound) isolated from E. jambolana not only inhibited cancer cell proliferation but also in addition induced cancer cell apoptosis. The isolated new saponin, glaucoside, was found to demonstrate remarkable apoptotic property on MCF-7 cells. The effect was also found to be concentration dependent. The compound was tested against MCF-7 cell lines at five different concentrations as 300, 150, 75.37.5, and 18.75 μg/mL for 24 h [Figure 1]. The antiproliferative bioassay showed that both the extract and compound inhibited the growth of the MCF-7 breast cancer cells in both doseand time-dependent manner. The concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 50% of the cells, i.e., IC50 values were calculated for both the samples against MCF-7 cell lines. The IC50 values were 253.6 μg/mL for the methanol extract and 176.2 μg/mL for the compound. It is noteworthy that the crude methanol extract was less effective at reducing the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells when compared to the compound. Nevertheless, our results provide preliminary data as to the ability of the extract and compound to inhibit the growth and induce apoptosis of human breast cancer cell lines in vitro. The results of this study warrant further investigation into the potential of E. jambolana berries and its derived food products, as chemopreventive agents against breast cancer. In addition, our future studies will investigate the possible mechanism of action against the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cell lines. This compound may provide clues for designing a range of novel semi-synthetic and synthetic compounds as medicinal anticancer agents in the near future. Further studies on the mode of action and the role of compound on pro-apoptotic factors are under progress. This report is the first of its kind to report the anticancer activity of the new glaucoside isolated. In conclusion, the plant and its compound examined in this study possess varying levels of anticancer activity in vitro. This is evident by the concentration-dependent manner reduction in the final number of cancer cells as a consequence to treatment. On the other hand, despite its possible toxicity, E. jambolana is frequently used orally as a medication in many conditions by traditional medicine.",2016.0,,2,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cde0a2aeb06ba77600f4bcc05f6c8ea1c4a45ae

One of the medical therapies mentioned in the Al-Qur'an and Hadith is cupping, which removes dirty blood from the body through a wound process carried out on the surface of the skin. This study aims to discover the history of cupping until it becomes a form of health therapy as well as views from the Islamic and medical side of cupping therapy. The method used is a literature study. Cupping therapy has existed since ancient Egypt and developed in various civilizations in various countries in the world, from Egypt, China, Europe, and America. The law of cupping in Islam is permissible and has been found in the books of nine hadith figures, special discussion of cupping is mentioned 275 times. The Prophet SAW recommended cupping in the middle of the month or after the middle of the month, but it is customary to do it in the third week. Cupping therapy in the medical world is explained using the approach of traditional medicine and modern medicine. Both agree that cupping therapy at certain points in the body can cure several diseases where the cupping is done or far from the area where the cupping is done. The benefits of cupping from a medical point of view are curing local ailments (neck pain, back pain, shoulder pain, knee pain, headaches, and migraines) and systematic diseases (Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis). In cupping therapy, it is mandatory to carry out infection control (washing hands before starting therapy, wearing complete PPE, disinfecting the skin and the place of therapy, managing waste, and trying to use disposable therapy equipment).",2022.0,2022-12-05,1,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d0248c20f9d8707d81cf0233430f1a2bd945b9d

However, financing constraints are major obstacle to the revitalization and transformation of China’s real economy. In this study, we constructed an environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (E-DSGE) model that incorporates two types of environmental expenditure and financing constraints, and discussed their economic and environmental effects. Based on this, we further considered the impacts of financing constraints on policy effects. Firstly, we found that increases in carbon emission reduction subsidies in government expenditure (1) increase total economic output and (2) motivate enterprises to increase emission reduction efforts and reduce pollution intensity and emissions, thereby reducing the inventory of environmental pollutants while balancing economic benefits and emission reduction. Secondly, increasing the proportion of government special expenditure on environmental protection promote output growth and directly reduces the pollution stock in the environment. However, such policies may also reduce the emission reduction efforts of enterprises, leading to increases in their pollution emissions and intensity. Lastly, the existence of financing constraints is not conducive to the growth of total output but increases the pollution control effect of emission reduction subsidies and pollution prevention expenditure. Application of the E-DSGE model offers new theoretical insight into environmental economics and macroeconomics. Moreover, the results of this study provide a reference for optimizing the structure of fiscal expenditure.",2024.0,2024-07-12,3,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00052b1a18b354e3c993315b477fc06b7479f99e

Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits high within-population variation in drought response. One hypothesis is that competitive context, varying at small scales, promotes diversity in resource use strategies. However, little is known about natural variation in competition effects on Arabidopsis physiology. We imposed drought and competition treatments on diverse genotypes. We measured resource economics traits, physiology, and fitness to characterize plasticity and selection in response to treatments. Plastic responses to competition differed depending on moisture availability. We observed genotype-drought-competition interactions for relative fitness: competitive gradients had little effect on relative fitness under well-watered conditions, while under drought competition caused rank changes in relative fitness. Early flowering was always selected. Higher δ13C was selected only in the harshest treatment (drought and competition). Competitive context changed the direction of selection on aboveground biomass in both well-watered and drought environments. Our results highlight how local biotic gradients modify abiotic selection, in some cases promoting diversity in abiotic stress response.

As SMEs involved in international business activities and often encounter unpredictable environments, they are expected to deal with various threats and risk that are related to intense competition in price and product, shrinking market and supplies, and as well as governments reviewed and altered rules. Thus, this paper will discuss about the entanglement of environmental hostility on Indonesian SMEs entrepreneurial orientation effort and their international performance. The main objective of this study is to discuss a conceptual framework that indicates the interrelationship between entrepreneurial orientation, environmental hostility and international performance of Indonesian SMEs. The proposed framework will examine the implication of Indonesian SMEs’ environmental orientation and international performance when the foreign countries’ business environment is in unfavourable condition. The findings of the study are expected to help Indonesian SMEs to be alert and more critical about hostile business environment in foreign countries as it can affect their business operation overseas. Additionally, Indonesian SMEs can apply strategic insights concerning potential impacts of uncertainties in foreign business environment to improve their international performance. Introduction In the new global economy, academics and practitioners are broadening their focus on cross-border business activity. Even to the smallest and newest organizations due to the increasing prominence of entrepreneurial firms. International entrepreneurship itself is define as the combination of willingness to be innovative, risk-seeking, performing proactive and aggressive behaviors (Ratten, International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 9 , No. 7, July, 2019, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2019 HRMARS 522 2006), which eventually known later as entrepreneurial orientation elements. Previous studies have recognized the entrepreneurial orientation’s elements as essential in strengthening the firm’s international performance (Li et al., 2008) , and recent study complement by also highlighted SMEs as one of the considered main factors that trigger the economic development (Divakara, 2018; Tiftik & Zincirkiran, 2013). Significant attention towards International entrepreneurship around the world (Horne et al., 2016) also have been received as well as by Indonesia (Bhasin and Sivakumar, 2010) . Tambunan (2011) reveals that Indonesia ranks first among ASEAN countries that has the most entrepreneurs, and this could then suggest a possibility of having more Indonesian expanding their business abroad. The statement is strengthened by data recorded by Indonesian Ministry of Trade (2015) ‘s directory book stated that as much as 4,495 firms are registered as international entrepreneurial firms. Other than that, Indonesia also being known for its biological and geographical richness, not to mention also as one of the culturally richest countries in the world. Furthermore, according to Indonesian National Development Planning Department, Indonesia’s population is more than enough to provide workforces. The fact that Indonesia has abundant resources and population can lead to its potential to create and develop entrepreneurs and firms to boost their livelihood through the economics. However, the number of Indonesian international entrepreneurial firms only represent approximately 1.56 percent from the total population of Indonesia (Aryanto, 2012; Sugiarto et al., 2014) , meanwhile the proportion of the entrepreneurs’ percentage in a developing country in Asia has to at least fulfil 2 percent of the total population (Sugiarto et al., 2014). To overlook the such as entrepreneurship condition in Indonesia, this study intends to assert environmental hostility as the influencing factor that could affect the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation effort of Indonesian international SMEs and international performance. Moreover, Lumpkin and Dess (2001) also highlights environmental hostility as one of main critical environmental factors in organizational and strategic management. The reason being, in a hostile environment, the competition intensity take more pressure on the firms, and could affect its probability of its success (Calantone et al., 1997) . Thus, environmental hostility is deemed appropriate to be investigated as a factor that could render the international performance of Indonesian SMEs. In the next sections this paper will discuss the interrelationship between entrepreneurial orientation, environmental hostility and international performance. To be more specific, this paper will only focus on linking 3 elements of entrepreneurial orientation which are innovativeness, proactiveness and risk taking towards international performance. Literature Review Entrepreneurial Orientation and International Performance EO is widely used by previous studies to describe performance. The importance of entrepreneurial orientation was argued by Gröβler (2007) and he further concluded that firms’ performance depend so much on its internal capabilities which match well with the concept of entrepreneurial orientation. Thus, entrepreneurial orientation is considered as the most important factor for firms’ performances (Lumpkin and Dess, 2001) . Innovativeness is the first element of entrepreneurial orientation taht will be traversed in this study. Being be responsive towards trends and demands in order to fulfil customers’ expectations are required as SMEs who operate their business internationally, which can be realized through product innovation and enhancement. In line with the findings of Umar et al. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 9 , No. 7, July, 2019, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2019 HRMARS 523 (2018) whose stated that SMEs should gain their competing skill in the market against competitors who are always trying to improve their products. It conforms to the interpretation of innovativeness as flexibility of firms in developing new ideas, which will lead to the increase in firms’ performance (Shirokova et al., 2013) . The importance of innovativeness was proven by the findings of Loof and Heshmati (2006) and Thoumrungroje and Tansuhaj (2005) study, who found that innovativeness and international performance have a strong significant relationship between them. The second elements of entrepreneurial orientation are proactiveness. Proactiveness described as the entrepreneurial firms abilities to capture customers’ behaviours and demands (Sandberg, 2007) and how a firm responses to a prospective market opportunity (Li et al., 2008) that other competitors have failed to recognize. The popular study which clarified the entrepreneurial orientation construct ant its relationship with performance, Lumpkin and Dess (1996), also pointed out that proactiveness has a significant effect on enhancing the firm’s performance . The understanding of proactiveness is complemented by the latest study done by Thourungroje and Racela (2018) , who claims that proactiveness is a substantial strategic posture to enhance the international performance. Supported by the empirical result of previous studies such as Jantunen et al. (2005), Thoumrungroje and Tansuhaj (2005) and Bak-Olesen (2013) proved that the relationship between proactiveness and international performance is significant and positive. The last element of entrepreneurial orientation, which will be discussed in this paper, is risk taking. Risk taking is generally linked to business strategy (McCarthy, 2000) , naming it as the driving force for entrepreneurs’ success. Furthermore, Lumpkin and Dess (2001) also claimed risk-taking as the courage to take actions in an unknown market with an unknown outcome in order to enhance the firms’ performance. Substantiated by Leko-Simic and Horvat (2006) and Thoumrungroje and Tansuhaj (2005) findings, which stated that risk-taking can positively affect international performance. With all the discussions on the effects of entrepreneurial orientation in benefiting international performance, the following proposition is predicted: Proposition 1 EO is positively associated with international performance of Indonesian entrepreneurial firms. Environmental Hostility as a Moderator Environmental hostility has been identified by Calantone et al. (1997) as the extent of threat that a firm faces due to the rate of intensity, vigour, and fierce competition. It has been also argued that in a hostile environment it is more likely to be intense competition of price, product, distribution and technology, regulatory restriction, shortage of labour and materials, and negative demographic trends (Miller and Friesen, 1983; Calantone et al., 1997) . Along with that argument, Covin and Slevin, 1989 and Lumpkin and Dess, 2001 considered hostility as the indication of scarcity and intensity of competition for environmental resources. Covin and Slevin (1989) further reckon that the adverse impact of environmental hostility affected small firms more, due to their limited resources and inability to survive because of their poor managerial decisions. The impact of environmental hostility on international performance is still discussed by the latest study. Hosseini et al. (2018) even empirically proved that environmental hostility significantly moderated the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and international performance. From the elaboration about how environmental hostility could interfere the international performance of SMEs, environmental International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 9 , No. 7, July, 2019, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2019 HRMARS 524 hostility is avowed as one of the most appropriate m",2019.0,2019-07-29,6,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b0a06fcf910b22326cd06e5aac5e666db5a43

The three concepts are also theoretically related because they all are concerned with human behavior and choices. There are varieties of theories in studying media economics, a few were examined and found to be relevant to Neuroeconomics, they include Theory of The Firm, The Consumer Theory, Theory of Ruinous Competition and Broadcast Media Concentration. The age of digitization has brought with it proliferation of especially electronic media, especially social media. This implies the traditional understanding of how media corporations operate have changed. It was found that consumption of digital media is rapidly increasing and becoming more personalized to individual behaviors and preferences, therefore neuroeconomics can help explain psychological mechanisms that lead to individual economic decision-making and understanding of media economics. Neuroeconomics , by leveraging on neuroscience, can contribute to understanding consumer habits, social networking and possibly predict choices of media consumers and/or detect consumers or groups that are likely to exhibit problematic behaviors. By using neuroeconomics models, media corporations can understand demand and consumer information, thereby tailoring media products in a way that will increase its value and utility to the consumers and ultimately profitability of the media corporations.",2021.0,2021-07-31,0,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0014718d69075ebeba2f8f3afa5f8784d9d93ac0

The rules of fiqh are present with the main purpose of determining Islamic law in the face of new challenges that continue to develop along with the changing times, especially in the context of economic transactions or muamalah maliyah which continues to grow in Islamic financial institutions.

The rapid increase in university education and decrease in fertility rate in Iran over the past decades might affect the achievement of the SDGs. However, the country’s female labour force participation (FLFP) rate stagnates at a superficial level. The stagnating FLFP rate is inconsistent with basic labour economics supply-side explanations while drawing attention to demand-side explanations, namely, female labour demand constraints, such as occupational segregation and labour market discrimination. This study empirically investigates the effect on FLFP of primary labour supply factors along with household conditions and gender norms and attitudes for 2 specific years: 2008 and 2018. The aim is to shed light on the causes of stagnation at the FLFP level by using the Household Expenditure and Income Survey conducted annually by the Statistical Center of Iran. The empirical findings suggest gender norms and attitudes towards working women and gendered division of work associated with family care as the driving forces of stagnation in FLFP in Iran.",2021.0,2021-10-28,8,58,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002a8a7bf101c49bf14c6804143cc3b3e2e36837

The study specifically examined the period-based impact of substance abuse prevalence and rehabilitated individual drug addicts on the actual growth rate of the Nigerian economy. 
Methodology: Autoregressive distributed lag and co-integration/bound test techniques were employed to analyze the data obtained. In between, correlation analysis and preliminary tests were carried out. 
Main findings: The study found out that substance abuse and rehabilitated drug individuals have a significant impact on economic performance. While substance abuse has a significant negative impact, rehabilitated, individual drug addicts have a significant positive impact. However, in the long run, there was no indication of a significant impact on the Nigerian economy. 
Research limitations/implications: This study will be of use to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and most drug control programs in many countries. The Ministries of Economic Planning to examine the extent to which drug abuse has had an economic impact. 
Novelty/Originality of this study: Economic analysis showcasing the effect of drug abuse prevalence and rehabilitated individuals on economic performance is quite scanty. This work creates a good reference point in areas of health economics and macroeconomics generally. It allows readers to know the genesis of drug trafficking and abuse in Nigeria.",2020.0,2020-06-27,6,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00316c67800f90a2d1c76758030f5d65a8a570b8

10.1080/17521440.2024.2308263,A behavioural law and economics approach to sustainability information,"ABSTRACT Mandatory disclosure is a traditional tool of corporate governance and securities regulation. The growing field of sustainable finance regulation has taken up the issue of corporate sustainability reporting. With respect to sustainable corporate governance, the shift from a shareholder centric approach to a stakeholder approach is underway. Moreover, behavioural corporate governance focuses on disclosure as a tool to trigger particular reactions in investors and companies. With respect to securities regulation, the efficient capital markets hypothesis has been challenged by behaviourists who have studied deviations from perfectly rational behaviour. Although behavioural findings are not new, lawmakers and courts have continued to rely extensively on disclosure obligations to promote efficient markets. This recurring theme of capital markets law deserves renewed attention given the extent to which the growing area of sustainable finance regulation has laid emphasis on sustainability disclosure. This article seeks to assess the implications of behavioural economics concerning the law and regulation of sustainability information in the capital markets.",2023.0,2023-01-02,0,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00342d76da5e290490f403fbc1e80e0fdba1bcdb

10.22214/ijraset.2019.4139,Analyzing the Effect of Parametric Variation on Performance of Grid Connected Solar PV System in Indian Scenario,": The performance and economy of a solar photovoltaic system depends on location and geographic parameters. Predicting energy efficiency is important for effective planning and evaluation rates. The proposed study explores the performance evaluation of three interconnected geographically connected photovoltaic solar systems. In Jaipur, Kolkata and Chennai have been testing a 1 MW solar PV system for a year. Simulations were performed using PV Syst (a software tool developed by the University of Geneva) and hourly weather data was obtained from NASA and METEONORM. The loss map for energy production and calculations shows the significant impact of geography on the performance and economics of solar PV systems. The monthly performance of the system indicates the impact of changes in weather parameters on radiation and ambient temperature performance and energy system performance. In order to optimize system performance, the annual power generation per unit of electricity at different locations was compared and discussed. to 4% (low latitude). For terrestrial interpolation, the uncertainty is 1% over a distance of 2 km, 6% to 100 km, and 8% for distances greater than 2000 km.

10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051464,Economic cost of smoking in people with mental disorders in the UK,"Background Smoking is the largest preventable cause of death in the UK and imposes a huge economic burden on society. Both the prevalence and extent of smoking are significantly higher among people with mental disorders than among the general population. Aims To estimate the economic costs of the health effects of cigarette smoking among people with mental disorders in the UK from a societal perspective. Methods This study uses the WHO's economics of tobacco toolkit to assess the costs of the health effects of cigarette smoking among people with mental disorders in 2009/10 in the UK. Based on the cost of illness approach, direct healthcare costs, indirect morbidity costs and indirect mortality costs due to smoking-related diseases were calculated to estimate the avoidable economic burden of smoking in people with mental disorders. Results The estimated economic cost of smoking in people with mental disorders was £2.34 billion in 2009/10 in the UK, of which, about £719 million (31% of the total cost) was spent on treating diseases caused by smoking. Productivity losses due to smoking-related diseases were about £823 million (35%) for work-related absenteeism and £797 million (34%) was associated with premature mortality. Conclusions Smoking in people with mental disorders in the UK imposes significant economic costs. The development and implementation of smoking cessation interventions in this group should therefore be a high economic and clinical priority.",2014.0,2014-07-09,19,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0042b7d62650e037d616969a0f90a5568dcaaff7

10.3390/g13040056,Measuring Price Risk Aversion through Indirect Utility Functions: A Laboratory Experiment,"The present paper introduces a theoretical framework through which the degree of risk aversion with respect uncertain prices can be measured through the context of the indirect utility function (IUF) using a lab experiment. First, the paper introduces the main elements of the duality theory (DT) in economics. Next, it proposes the context of IUFs as a suitable framework for measuring price risk aversion through varying prices as opposed to varying payoffs, which has been common practice in the mainstream of experimental economics. Indeed, the DT in modern microeconomics indicates that the direct utility function (DUF) and the IUF are dual to each other, implicitly suggesting that the degree of risk aversion (or risk seeking) that a given rational subject exhibits in the context of the DUF must be equivalent to the degree of risk aversion (or risk seeking) elicited through the context of the IUF. This paper tests the accuracy of this theoretical prediction through a lab experiment using a series of relevant statistical tests. This study uses the multiple price list (MPL) method, which has been one of the most popular sets of elicitation procedures in experimental economics to study risk preferences in the experimental laboratory using non-interactive settings. The key findings of this study indicate that price risk aversion (PrRA) is statistically significantly greater than payoff risk aversion (PaRA). Additionally, it is shown that the risk preferences elicited under the expected utility theory (EUT) are somewhat subject to context. Other findings imply that the risk premium (RP), as a measure of willingness to pay for insuring an uncertain situation, is statistically significantly greater for stochastic prices compared to that for stochastic payoffs. These results are robust across different MPL designs and various statistical tests that are utilized.",2022.0,2022-08-16,0,39,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00485cf3edcb7c5d6970d30fdd9798c16fb30d6c
10.18564/jasss.1925,An Agent Based Model of Switching: The Case of Boulogne S/mer Fish Market,"The question of efficiency of market organization is an important one in economics. When theoretical results suggest the dominance of auctions, empirical studies present more mitigated results putting forward that the global efficiency depends on agents' characteristics and market environment. The Boulogne s/mer fish market is organized in a particular way. Both buyers and sellers can daily choose to exchange through an auction mechanism or through a negotiated one. First empirical results reveal that, at a macro level, this organization is a stable one: the negative price- quantity relation is verified, suggesting a global rationality, even if this relation is not verified for all the individuals. At a micro-level, empirical evidence points out that the agents purchase most of the time on one same market (auctions or negotiated) and this market corresponds to the best choice for them, in terms of prices and quantities sold. A second result then suggests that the performance of a mode of organization depends on the characteristics of the traders and on the features of the good sold. Empirical study also reveals that most of the agents regularly switch from one market to the other. To understand the reasons for this switching, we consider this market as a complex system and simulate an agent based model where limited rational individuals are endowed with simple learning rules (noisy or myopic strategies). The auction sub-market plays a benchmark role, the only strategic possibility for sellers is to decide to go (or not) on the negotiated sub-market. A third result is that macro stability results from the aggregate behaviour of limited rational individuals and this, without any need of central coordinator. A fourth result is that agents daily choose their sub-market according to the global quantities sold on the whole market.",2012.0,2012-03-31,14,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004a416135c792e47c3192dfe221d2b13ef42e6e

10.30838/j.bpsacea.2312.261223.111.1013,FEATURES OF USING CRUSHED CONCRETE AS A COARSE AGGREGATE FOR CONCRETE,"Problem statement. According to the results of a study by the Kyiv School of Economics as of June 2023 the total amount of direct documented damage to residential and non-residential infrastructure due to destruction and damage as a result of military actions exceeded $150.5 billion. During the post-war reconstruction Ukraine will face the problem of a large number of buildings and structures that will be subject to partial dismantling and demolition. This process will be accompanied by the generation of a significant amount of construction waste, which traditionally in Ukraine is taken to landfills without recycling. On the other hand, there will be a need for a large quantity of construction materials, the share of which in the construction cost may reach 50 %. To reduce the cost of objects, it is advisable to reuse materials from waste generated after dismantling. Such materials are called recycling. The most obvious option is the use of crushed concrete waste as a coarse aggregate for the production of new concrete. The purpose of the article. Identification of the features of recycled coarse aggregates from concrete waste and concrete with their use, determination of the influence of source concrete on the properties of recycled aggregates. Conclusions. The mesoscopic model of concrete with recycled coarse aggregate has been examined. The analysis of the current research results on both recycled concrete aggregates and concrete with their use showed that, in general, with correct calculations of concrete mix compositions that consider the actual physical and mechanical properties of recycled aggregates, the production of structural concrete is possible. At the same time, crushing methods and the grain composition of such aggregates have a significant influence. In order to standardize the approaches to the research of recycled aggregates, it is necessary to create an appropriate methodology or regulatory framework.",2024.0,2024-02-26,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00523ace906b265452f114561a913557dd1c1e61

It focuses primarily on the relationship between social class and work-related income. Yet, it has been shown that wealth, rather than income, was the decisive feature of contemporary inequality and that wealth and income increasingly tend to be captured through the same households. To bridge the gap between the two disciplines and provide a comprehensive understanding of socioeconomic inequality, this article developed an integrated analysis of wealth and income distribution among occupational groups at different ages in five major European countries. To that end, we used the Household Financial and Consumption Survey [2014 wave] of the European Central Bank network.",2022.0,2022-06-10,5,71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005bbf552b306d2146043bee16ab5d01771c89ad

The study used an ex post facto research design, which is based on examining the independent and dependent variables after events have already occurred and using data that is already available in order to determine the relationship between the variables. In order to gather data for this study, a documentary method based on the examination of documents and materials was used. Documentary methods are the procedures used to classify, examine, and analyze documents, whether they are in the public or private domain. To analyze the data generated from this study, the study relied on qualitative descriptive analysis. The major findings of the study are that there are other intervening variables that affect economic growth in addition to health and poverty indicators, external debt is viewed as being harmful to a nation's ability to advance economically, and given the impact of debt to the living standard of the Nigeria people, health expenditure on economics, it could be deduced that even though health expenditure increases, it could have a negligible impact on economic growth if it is not maximized effectively to produce improved health outcomes. It is therefore the recommendation of the study that government should diversify the nation's export base so as to increase export earnings and promote industrialization in order to reduce import dependency as a high exchange rate will make our goods more attractive in the foreign market and will increase foreign exchange earnings.",2023.0,2023-01-23,0,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005ece8400600b98f591c8dadebd4cae7ab2b5ba

The monitoring involved aspects related to soil, flora, livestock and economics (competitiveness differential). The study showed, although in the short term, that the minimum stocking rate 0.2 LU/ha/year was not effective and, conversely, the effectiveness of the maximum level of stocking rate (4 LU/ha) for the maintenance of the habitat. The generalization in applying minimum and maximum rate, not taking into account the climatic conditions, forage resources or farming system (including the species of grazing animal) may lead to a serious nullification of the conditions of the Standard. The authors recommend to identify homogeneous areas and eligible specific stocking rates from all Italian regions, also considering the animal species.",2015.0,2015-12-02,4,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006773f5d3e5986f17141926cc38bc2ad719a06d

Recent disasters have highlighted that a focus on minimizing cost can result in a fragile system, such as the immense economic loss and adverse societal impacts after the 2021 Texas Winter Storm. Resilience objectives must also be considered to guide power system operation through unexpected non-ideal conditions. The long-term survivability of ecosystems against various unexpected catastrophes has been quantified by ecologists using the metric <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathit{R_{ECO}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>. The metric depends on a system’s network structure and energy flows, enabling its application to power systems to investigate the impact of a bio-inspired power system to address resilience needs. This paper formulates an ecological robustness oriented OPF (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$R_{ECO}$</tex-math></inline-formula> OPF) problem to optimize power systems for reliability and survivability under unexpected contingencies. Six power system cases, ranging from 24- to 500-buses are optimized, comparing the reliability and cost of the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${R_{ECO}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> OPF with an economics-driven OPF and a security-constrained OPF (SCOPF). The results show the ecologically-inspired method is able to improve the reliability of the power systems with fewer violations and unsolved scenarios during unexpected disturbances. The results also support the potential to use <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${R_{ECO}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> to control power flow distribution for improved survivability and resilience.",2023.0,2023-01-01,5,72,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0069a2760f6e57ead1dd88c9129072403aba9d5e

A stratified multistage random sampling procedure was used to select the area of study and respondents. The farmers/farm households were categorized into small or subsistence farms (1-3 cows), medium (4-10 cows), and large farms (more than 10 cows). When calculated on a milch animal basis, the average costs of production per litre of milk (cost B) were rupees 28.09, 28.49, 25.68, and 27.69 in small, medium, large and overall farms, respectively. The average costs/litre of milk after deduction of imputed family labour (cost A) were 19.93, 22.78, 24.93, and 21.81 in small, medium, large, and overall farms, respectively. It was observed that on the milch animal basis, the average cost/litre of milk (cost B) were 32.51, 34.29, 29.08, and 32.29 in small, medium, large, and overall farms, respectively. The average cost per litre of milk after deduction of imputed family labour cost (cost A) were 22.02, 26.33, 27.08, and 24.34 in small, medium, large, and overall farms, respectively.

10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3293646,Sequential Vision to Language as Story: A Storytelling Dataset and Benchmarking,"Storytelling is a remarkable human skill that plays a significant role in learning and experiencing everyday life. Developing narratives is central to human mental health development, simultaneously encapsulating broad details such as psychology, morality and common sense. Contemporary deep-learning algorithms require similar skills to be able to tell a story from a visual perspective. However, most algorithms function at a superficial or factual level, aligning descriptive text with images in a one-to-one manner without considering the temporal relation. Stories are more expressive in style, language and content, involving imaginary concepts not explicit in the images. An ideal deep learning system should learn and develop cohesive, meaningful, and causal stories. Unfortunately, most existing storytelling methods are trained and evaluated on a single dataset, i.e., the VIsual STorytelling (VIST) dataset. Multiple datasets are essential to test the generalization ability of algorithms. We bridge the gap and present a new dataset for expressive and coherent story creation. We present the Sequential Storytelling Image Dataset (SSID, https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/sequential-storytelling-image-dataset-ssid) consisting of open-source video frames accompanied by story-like annotations. We provide four annotations (stories) for each set of five images. The image sets are collected manually from publicly available videos in three domains: documentaries, lifestyle, and movies, and then annotated manually using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We perform a detailed analysis and benchmarking of the current VIST dataset and our new SSID dataset and show that both datasets exhibit high variance within their multiple ground truth stories corresponding to the same image set. Moreover, our dataset achieves lower mean average scores across all metrics, meaning that the ground truth stories of our dataset are more diverse. Finally, we train and evaluate existing state-of-the-art rhetorical storytelling methods on both datasets and show that our dataset is more challenging and requires sophisticated techniques to accurately detect a significant variety of events.",2023.0,,1,67,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001b754cab68e6c2671ea42d9d0c9891a1bb7c9

I specialized in rehabilitation psychology and received additional training in neuropsychology. I focused the bulk of my graduate training on developing strong clinical skills because I wanted the research I produced to be informed by clinical experience. My research training gave me a strong foundation in research methodology and statistical analysis. But I underestimated the business side of research and the culture of academia overall. When I decided to pursue dedicated research training in disparities in cognitive aging, it had to be a full-time commitment, as it had been with my clinical training. Focused research training helped me progress much better and faster than I would have been able to trying to juggle both a clinical and research career. I became much better at grant writing and at communicating my research. I also believe that no person is an island. So, I also credit my success to organically forming the right combination of formal and informal mentors, peers, and other friendships during each step of my career, along with maintaining relevant pre-existing kin- and friend-ships. I was told early on that a career in clinical research is a marathon, not a sprint, but it took me a bit of time to fully understand that statement.

10.1177/147470491000800212,Book Review: Climbing Mount Impossible: An Important Book Written Too Early,"Introduction Martin Brüne decided to climb Mount Impossible. He wished to write a general textbook on psychiatry, a daunting task in itself for a single author. To top this, he wanted to base it primarily on an evolutionary perspective. But there is only one current treatment with any evidence of effect founded explicitly on evolutionary theory (Paul Gilbert's, 2009, compassion-focused therapy—not described in the book). Further, almost all of the research on specific disorders is in its infancy. The best and most original theories and approaches need more research and empirical support. I agree with Brüne that the diagnostic systems have important weaknesses, but there are no current nosologies/taxonomies based on evolutionary theory—thus the research so far on the vague and often biologically meaningless phenotypes will be of limited interest. Do not misunderstand: I am an evolutionary psychopathologist, too, and I share Brüne's conviction that an evolutionary approach is fundamental to understanding human nature, including the nature of mental disorders. I just believe we need something firmer to stand on when informing clinical practice. Brüne believes that current psychiatry only addresses half of what is needed to fully understand psychopathology—referring to Tinbergen's (1963) basic questions and the lack of ultimate level analysis in mainstream psychiatry. There is all reason to agree with him. Psychiatry also needs a science of "" normalcy "" , he claims. Yet again, I agree, and would like to point out that such a science exists: Psychology. As an evolutionary psychologist I believe this is the most relevant meta-theory for psychology, but at this point in time there is no reason to limit psychiatry to only considering evolutionary psychology when looking for a science of normalcy. When supervising psychiatrists in training, I recommend that they read basic psychology. Some do. I believe they will understand more. The book therefore sets off on a difficult but important journey. To succeed it demands a comprehensive analysis of all aspects of psychiatry from an evolutionary perspective, most of",2010.0,2010-04-01,0,16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0009bcfe7a966225df9a6870fe9f3a723ebc1fd0
10.52700/ijlc.v1i2.19,A CORPUS-BASED STUDY OF CONJUNCTIVE COHESION IN PAKISTANI RESEARCH ARTICLES,"Conjunctive cohesion is an indispensable linguistic signpost that writers use to create a logical relationship between the parts of the text (Halliday and Hasan, 1976). In the present study, the conjunctive analysis of Pakistani Social Science Articles (PSSA) has been carried out. This study is corpus-based, and the corpus comprised 250 articles that were taken from five Social science disciplines: Applied Linguistics (AL), English Literature (EL), Business Administration (BA), Sociology (SL), and Psychology (PL). The distribution of 50 articles from each discipline had been retrieved from online sources. The frequencies of conjunctive features (CFs) were counted and compared, and conjunctive features (CFs) were studied functionally. A comprehensive model on conjunctive cohesion (CC) has been proposed for the classification of cohesive devices. The results revealed that all the writers used extension conjunction more frequently than other conjunctions. Additive cohesion, a sub-category of extension conjunction,  was used more frequently across the academic writings of all disciplines in general and discipline of EL in particular. The sub-categories of elaboration and enhancement conjunction, exemplification and causative, were also found to be used more frequently in addition to the additive cohesion. Consequently, it was concluded that the academic writings of EL had high frequencies of conjunctive cohesion, and various categories of conjunctive cohesion were used to serve certain purposes. This study has practical implications for social science teachers and scholars in addition to EFL/ESL students.",2020.0,2020-12-31,0,12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a04896a12073affe0e8f54d77b89bf4636df2

10.31499/2617-2100.10.2023.285313,Psychological aspects of the development of personal reliability of subjects of entrepreneurial activity,"The article reveals theoretical bases of psychological structure of personal reliability of subjects of entrepreneurial activity. It is conditioned by the fact that a businessman is a motive power of the development of civilization and it was confirmed by the historical development of the humanity. The figure of a businessman is not characterized by what and which volume he owns but by special qualities of his character – initiative, authority, gift of prediction, readiness to the risk. The problem of the development of personal reliability of businessmen and components which influence it are also considered. The model of the development of personal reliability of subjects of entrepreneurial activity is offered. It is underlined that a modelling method in psychology is a means of study of psychical reality by the constructed schemes of an object or phenomenon; it is the ideal or materially realized system which represents or reproduces a research object and is capable to substitute it in such a way that its study gives new information about the object; it is a psychological modelling which is the inalienable form of all types of psychological work: research, diagnostics, advising, correction. The worked out model of the development of personal reliability of a businessman represents: principles of the development of personal reliability of a specialist; semantic components of personal reliability; professional functions (roles); the program of the development of personal reliability; forms, methods and means of the development of personal reliability; monitoring of psychological efficiency of the program of the development of personal reliability; levels and criteria of formed personal reliability of subjects of entrepreneurial activity. Semantically functional and organizational blocks of models of the development of personal reliability of subjects of entrepreneurial activity has been worked out.",2023.0,2023-07-28,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000ed89dde80ab2083ab06a03cf9175ac1816c80
10.32843/2663-5208.2022.35.12,CONCEPTUAL PREREQUISITES FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF PROFESSIONAL SPEECH COMPETENCE,"Власенко О.О. докторант зі спеціальності 053 «Психологія» Університет Григорія Сковороди в Переяславі Низка концептуальних передумов визначила виникнення та багатоаспектність дослідження сутності феномену «професійно-мовленнєвої компетентності». Передумовами виникнення будь яких навичок у індивіда є певні фізіологічні та психічні фактори. Фізіологічні фактори – це збереження та цілісність всіх структур мозку, відповідна працездатність центральної нервової системи, що передає імпульси від мозку до м’язів та координує роботу периферичного мовного апарату: дихального, голосового та артикуляційного. З позиції психології, професійно-мовленнєва компетентність є міжпредметною дефініцією. В статті висвітлено ряд поглядів на визначену дефініцію. Філософія розглядає мову з позиції чотирьох напрямів: феноменології, аналітизму, герменевтики та постмодернізму. Аналіз мови як психологічного явища, що відображує психологію промовця, почався лише у XIX–XX ст. Представники соціальної психології вбачали сутність мови у соціальній природі психології людини. Переоцінка психологічного розуміння сутності мови починається наприкінці ХІХ ст. З’являється напрямок вивчення мови – психолінгвістика. Головним предметом якої є мовна діяльність, а кінцевою метою – опис психофізіологічних механізмів походження мови. Виокремлено три основні напрямки: соціально-психологічний, індивідуально-психологічний та психолінгвістичний. Запровадження використання компетентнісного підходу в усіх напрямках діяльності спричинило появу нових видів компетентностей, яких повинен мати індивід упродовж свого життя. Однією з таких відокремлених компетентностей є професійно-мовленнєва, яка була визначена науковцями з позиції необхідності використання мовлення при виконанні професійних обов’язків. Різноманітність поглядів на вищеозначений феномен та довготерміновість досліджень споріднених дефініцій свідчить про грунтовність глибинних досліджень цієї компетентності. Ключові слова: мова, мовленнєвість, компетентність, мовна компетентність, професійно-мовленнєва компетентність. A number of conceptual preconditions determined the origin and multifaceted study of the essence of the phenomenon of «professional speech competence». Prerequisites for the emergence of any skills in the individual are certain physiological and mental factors. Physiological factors are the preservation and integrity of all brain structures, the proper functioning of the central nervous system, which transmits impulses from the brain to the muscles and coordinates the work of the peripheral speech apparatus: respiratory, vocal and articulatory. From the standpoint of psychology, professional speech competence is an interdisciplinary definition. The article highlights a number of views on a certain definition. Philosophy considers language from the standpoint of four areas: phenomenology, analytics, hermeneutics and postmodernism. Analysis of language as a psychological phenomenon that reflects the psychology of the speaker began only in the XIX-XX centuries. Representatives of social psychology saw the essence of language in the social nature of human psychology. Reassessment of the psychological understanding of the essence of language begins in the late nineteenth century. The direction of language learning is psycholinguistics. The main subject of which is language activity, and the ultimate goal – a description of psychophysiological mechanisms of language origin. We distinguish three main areas: socio-psychological, individual psychological and psycholinguistic. The introduction of the use of the competence approach in all areas of activity has led to the emergence of new types of competencies that an individual should have throughout his life. One of these separate competencies is professional speech, which has been identified by scholars from the standpoint of the need to use speech in the performance of professional duties. The diversity of views on the above phenomenon and the longevity of research on related definitions indicates the soundness of in-depth research on this competence.",2022.0,,0,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f688f5cd42f9d9fbd4b14d116db7dcf8652d6

10.53761/1.20.4.07,The five Ps of LD: Using formulation in Learning Development work for a student-centred approach to ‘study skills’,"Learning Development is a field of practice concerned with supporting students to develop their study skills, including academic and assessment literacies. It is strongly rooted in values that are student-centred, collaborative and emancipatory rather than remedial or deficit. However, in the wider dominant culture of UK HE institutions, Learning Developers are often placed in an implicitly hierarchical relationship with students, ""giving advice and guidance"", at odds with these values. Without a clear model for practice to help them enact their values in a student-centred and dialogic way, Learning Developers may risk pathologizing the student, depriving them of agency and expertise, in an overly prescriptive and instrumental approach to skills development. This paper explores formulation, a core skill in Clinical Psychology, and its applicability in Learning Development. Formulation is a method of integrating theory and practice, clinical expertise with the client’s own experience and insight, through its meaning to the client. With a focus on equality, person-centred practice and co-created meaning, it is well aligned to Learning Development values. This paper examines how formulation can be adapted for Learning Development one-to-one work and other forms of provision, and proposes a practical model, the Five Ps of LD, which integrates multiple perspectives with longitudinal, cross-sectional and socio-cultural factors into a holistic shared understanding of the Learning Development need.",2023.0,2023-05-02,2,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0013206e1fbbf01cf6f692613337c3853873f1d8

However, fewer studies have explored the potential influencing mechanisms of cyberbullying victimization from a positive psychology perspective. Therefore, based on the positive youth development theory, this study will explore the potential mediator and moderator in the relationship between positive youth development (PYD) attributes and cyberbullying victimization through a longitudinal design. 719 students (Mage = 15.95 years, SD = 0.76, 45.2% boy) participated in the study and completed self-report questionnaires on relevant variables. The result found that students’ level of PYD significantly and negatively predicted the level of cyberbullying victimization. Meanwhile, SEM analysis showed that PYD influenced individuals’ cyberbullying victimization by affecting their internet gaming disorder (IGD), while depression levels moderated the relationship between PYD and IGD. This study examines cyberbullying victimization from a positive psychology orientation, with potential prevention and intervention value.",2023.0,2023-06-30,3,82,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001395be89f7727de0476b7fd4d914f15e078b98

10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1453855,Adult attachment and dehumanization among Chinese college students: trait attachment and state attachment perspectives,"Introduction Current social issues such as bullying, online violence, and local conflicts are all prominent topics in the field of psychology and linked to dehumanization. However, research on dehumanization from a non-Western background has been rare. As a key factor influencing individual behavior, attachment has not been sufficiently integrated into studies on dehumanization. Therefore, this study provides empirical evidence to explore the relationship between adult attachment (both trait and state) and dehumanization. The sample consisted of college students from China. Methods In Study 1 (N = 705) latent profile analysis was employed to exploring the potential categories of trait adult attachment in China, and to investigate how these categories impact dehumanization. Study 2 (N = 281) focused on activating secure attachment and examined the effects of three state attachment types, security, avoidance and anxiety, on dehumanization. Results Study 1 identified four types of adult attachment: preoccupied, secure, fearful, and dismissing, and revealed that these different attachment types have varying impacts on dehumanization. Study 2 showed that both security and avoidance predict dehumanization. Discussion This research established a link between adult attachment and dehumanization, offering new insights into the psychological mechanisms underlying dehumanization and suggesting novel strategies for its prevention and intervention.",2024.0,2024-09-19,0,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001879f406bac3f6dc08ce118637344abb5e0866
10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-405-406,Editorial,"The special issue is devoted to the memory of professor Yuri Konstantinovich Kornilov. His works and pedagogical talent influenced the formation of several gene - rations of problem solving and creativity researchers. The twenties of the 20th century was the period of the beginning of experimental research into creativity and its comprehension as part of the experimental psychology of thinking. It is difficult to single out any particular date. It could be 1921, when W. Köhler's book Intelligenzprüfungen an Menschenaffen was published in German. It could be 1925 when this book was translated into English (The Mentality of Apes), and the subsequent publication that to a large extent ensured the wide popularity of the work and introduced the term Insight, still central to creativity research today. Or it could be 1926, which is the date G. Wallas published his work The Art of Thought, where he describes the basic stages of the creative process. Anyway, we have a century-long history of Insight Problem Solving research as an experimental paradigm of creativity research. Insight studies got a second wind in the 1980s, when the question of specificity of insightful solution in comparison with the processes of solving well-algorithmizable problems, described in the problem space theory by H. Simon, was raised. The search for specific mechanisms of insightful solutions has become a catalyst for the evolution of an independent and rapidly developing field of interdisciplinary studies, which has also been contributed to by Russian researchers. These are both scientists who worked during the classical period of research of thinking and creativity (S.L. Rubinstein, A.V. Brushlinsky, Ya.A. Ponomarev) and our contemporaries, whose texts are presented in this issue. The range of problems discussed in this issue reflects the main trends in insight research in recent years. This is a construction of theoretical models that allow us to explain the specific mechanisms of insightful solution, and identify factors that determine the specificity. This issue features articles by S.Yu. Korovkin; I.Yu. Vla - di mirov, A.V. Smirnitskaya, E.A. Shushkova (specifics of functioning of working memory subsystems at different stages of insightful solution); N.I. Loginov, V.F. Spi - ridonov (specifics of participation in the thought process of embodied knowledge); and E.A. Valueva, N.M. Lapteva; A.A. Medyntsev; T.V. Shumilov, A.V. Chisto - polskaya, I.Yu. Vladimirov (the role of emotions and metacognitive feelings in the regulation of insightful solution). Research methods of insightful solution, (especially important in the context of complexity), poor comprehension and the difficulties of recording the phenomenon under study, are equally presented here. For example, the paper by F.N. Markin and A.D. Savinova considers the potential and limitations of the task method for the laboratory study of thinking and creativity processes. The article by T.V. Shumilov, A.V. Chistopolskaya, and I.Yu. Vladi mirov raises the question of ways to improve the accuracy of self-reporting techniques for recording insightful solution events. The article by I.Yu. Vladimirov, A.V. Smir - nitskaya, and E.A. Shushkova discusses the possibility of combining behavioral and electrophysiological methods to study insightful solution processes. The articles in this issue not only reflect the current state of affairs in the field of insight research, but also identify the outlines for the further development of research. The authors hope that the material presented will be of interest both to colleagues engaged in the research on thinking, creativity, and cognitive processes and to a wide range of readers specializing in related studies and applied fields.",2023.0,2023-09-30,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00194e333a868d76a095c86dca49980f5138c1ba

However, this does not require that students be ready for the world of work. Students still feel anxious and lack confidence in the world of work, even though they are in the final semester and will graduate from college. If this condition is continued, students will have difficulty competing in the world of work later. Therefore, students may need tough conditions themselves that help to overcome obstacles in themselves as well as obstacles in the world of work, this tough condition is called hardiness. The purpose of this study is to determine the level of hardiness and the level of work readiness as well as to determine the relationship between hardiness and job readiness in Islamic Psychology students of IAIN Kediri class 2018. The subjects of this study amounted to 97 students of Islamic Psychology IAIN Kediri class 2018. As for the sampling technique, Researchers used a non-probability technique, namely accidental sampling. Furthermore, for data processing using the SPSS 20 for windows application using descriptive statistical analysis methods of frequency and non-parametric statistics with Spearman Rho hypothesis testing. Based on this research, it was found that the average student's hardiness level was in the medium category, amounting to 45.4%. The level of student work readiness is in the medium category average of 47.4%. Based on the results of the analysis of Spearman Rho, a score of 0.802 was obtained with a significance value (2 tailed) of 0.000. This statement can be interpreted as Ha is accepted and Ho is rejected. Then the correlation value is positive and has very strong criteria, which means that the relationship between hardiness and work readiness is 0.802 and has very strong criteria.

Therefore, to improve the current situation of tourism consumption, improve the consumer sentiment of tourists, and promote the development of the tourism economy, the convolutional neural network (CNN) technology model is used to analyze the tourist's consumer psychology and behavior. Based on this, the user's consumption situation is analyzed, thus providing support for the intelligent improvement of tourism consumption. First, the basic characteristics of tourism consumption mood and behavior are introduced, and the methods to improve the tourism consumption mood and behavior are briefly introduced. Then, the CNN algorithm is employed to identify consumers' travel consumption behaviors and emotions. To improve the recognition effect, the algorithm is combined with skeleton node behavior recognition and video image behavior recognition. Finally, the performance of the designed algorithm is tested. The accuracy of the human behavior recognition (HBR) algorithm is more than 0.88. Compared with the detection effect of the HBR algorithm, the combined algorithm adopted in this work can reduce the image processing time and improve the detection efficiency. The multithread method can effectively reduce the complexity of the model and improve the recognition accuracy. The test results on different data sets show that the proposed algorithm can better adapt to the changes in identification samples and obtain more accurate recognition results compared with similar algorithms. In summary, this study not only provides technical support for the rational analysis of consumer sentiment and consumer behavior but also contributes to the comprehensive development of the tourism market.",2022.0,2022-12-19,4,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0027e5fb2c5463ce1497f04303c90a57cdd1a22b

Try Gosset’s Guinnessometrics When a Little “p” Is Not Enough,"Abstract A crisis of validity has emerged from three related crises of science, that is, the crises of statistical significance and complete randomization, of replication, and of reproducibility. Guinnessometrics takes commonplace assumptions and methods of statistical science and stands them on their head, from little p-values to unstructured Big Data. Guinnessometrics focuses instead on the substantive significance which emerges from a small series of independent and economical yet balanced and repeated experiments. Originally developed and market-tested by William S. Gosset aka “Student” in his job as Head Experimental Brewer at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Gosset’s economic and common sense approach to statistical inference and scientific method has been unwisely neglected. In many areas of science and life, the 10 principles of Guinnessometrics or G-values outlined here can help. Other things equal, the larger the G-values, the better the science and judgment. By now a colleague, neighbor, or YouTube junkie has probably shown you one of those wacky psychology experiments in a video involving a gorilla, and testing the limits of human cognition. In one video, a person wearing a gorilla suit suddenly appears on the scene among humans, who are themselves engaged in some ordinary, mundane activity such as passing a basketball. The funny thing is, prankster researchers have discovered, when observers are asked to think about the mundane activity (such as by counting the number of observed passes of a basketball), the unexpected gorilla is frequently unseen (for discussion see Kahneman 2011). The gorilla is invisible. People don’t see it.",2019.0,2019-03-20,14,53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002e0628b2f4a221c4c2beb680c89c29d8cc1228

An emerging medical service is the AI pharmacy intravenous admixture service (PIVAS) that prepares infusions through robots. However, patients may distrust these robots. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the psychological mechanism of patients’ trust in AI PIVAS. Methods We conducted one field study and four experimental studies to test our hypotheses. Study 1 and 2 investigated patients’ trust of AI PIVAS. Study 3 and 4 examined the effect of subjective understanding on trust in AI PIVAS. Study 5 examined the moderating effect of informed consent. Results The results indicated that patients’ reluctance to trust AI PIVAS (Studies 1–2) stems from their lack of subjective understanding (Study 3). Particularly, patients have an illusion of understanding humans and difficulty in understanding AI (Study 4). In addition, informed consent emerges as a moderating factor, which improves patients’ subjective understanding of AI PIVAS, thereby increasing their trust (Study 5). Discussion The study contributes to the literature on algorithm aversion and cognitive psychology by providing insights into the mechanisms and boundary conditions of trust in the context of AI PIVAS. Findings suggest that medical service providers should explain the criteria or process to improve patients’ subjective understanding of medical AI, thus increasing the trust in algorithm-based services.",2024.0,2024-09-05,0,53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00349f2ab952396a37d949ffad5bce7646cc3b71

From the emerging and innovative area of psychology of sustainability and sustainable development, this study aimed to analyze the relationship that job demands (workload), and personal resources (psychological capital) have with burnout. The sample includes 517 workers from various professional sectors. Results of the structural equation analysis show that (1) psychological capital and workload are related to burnout, and (2) personal accomplishment is more a personal resource than burnout dimension. The results confirm the role of psychological capital as a protective factor for burnout.

10.31650/2707-403x-2024-18-329-335,THE INFLUENCE OF BIOPHILIC DESIGN ON HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY,"Biophilic design is becoming increasingly popular in modern architecture, especially in the context of improving quality of life and the psycho-emotional state of people. The concept of biophilia, rooted in the natural human instinct to be close to nature, forms the foundation for designing spaces that enhance the psychological well-being of users. This article explores the psychological impact of biophilic design and provides examples of its successful integration into contemporary architecture. The focus is on how various elements of biophilic design, such as natural light, green spaces, water features, and organic forms, contribute to stress reduction, increased productivity, and overall mood improvement. Recent studies underscore the significance of biophilic design in fostering a deeper connection between users and their surroundings, thereby enhancing comfort and well-being. By incorporating natural elements into built environments, biophilic design not only promotes mental health but also supports cognitive functions, encouraging creativity and improving concentration. Additionally, this article examines case studies where biophilic design principles, such as the use of organic materials, landscape views, and airflow, have been implemented to create therapeutic environments. These examples demonstrate how strategic design interventions can transform spaces into areas of restoration, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more satisfying experience for users. Furthermore, this article discusses methodological approaches to assessing the psychological outcomes of biophilic spaces, highlighting the role of user-centered design in achieving sustainable and emotionally restorative architecture. As architects continue to explore the potential of biophilic design, there is a growing need to understand the mechanisms through which such designs impact human emotions and behaviors. By delving into these aspects, this study aims to provide a foundation for future research and development in the creation of environments that support both mental well-being and physical comfort.",2024.0,2024-12-16,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003a11ad333eea7e1fbd19894104dceda7769a59

10.31083/j.rcm2503100,Cardiovascular Diseases Increased among the Rural and Urban Population of the Northern Regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan during COVID-19: A Descriptive Study with Forecasting,"Background: The biggest health problem in most developed countries of the world, including Kazakhstan, is high morbidity and death rates due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), both in urban and rural areas. As is known during the outbreak of COVID-19, the inaccessibility of many medical services played a big role in the incidence of CVD, in particular in the northern regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan (KZ). The objective of our research was to analyze the prevalence of CVD in city and village regions of the northern regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan, considering the outbreak period with forecasting. Methods: A descriptive study with forecasting was conducted based on the “Health of the population of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the activities of healthcare organizations”, secondary statistical reporting data (collected volume) of the KZ. Information from this database was collected for five districts, two cities and one city of regional significance in the northern region of the KZ. Results: According to our descriptive study, the incidence of CVD indicates a comparatively large prevalence of CVD among the municipal population of the northern regions of the KZ. The prevalence of CVD in urban areas of the North Kazakhstan region (NKR) was 1682.02 (2015) and 4784.08 (2020) per 100,000 population. Among rural NKR residents, it was (per 100,000 population) 170.84 (2015) and 341.98 (2020). According to the forecast, by 2025, the incidence of CVD will grow, both in urban (7382.91/100,000) and in rural areas (417.29/100,000). Conclusions: Given the situation during the pandemic, the incidence of CVD has had a sharp increase, both in the rural and in urban areas of the northern regions of the KZ. This may be due to the poor availability of medical facilities, and medical services, which may have prevented timely diagnosis, as well as the psychology of the situation and the load on cardiac activity in relation to the pandemic.",2024.0,2024-03-01,0,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003dc1a907419d908f8f039a1709f7984b100636

10.22363/2313-2302-2023-27-3-726-739,Bodily-Affective Aspects of Phenomen in Malevich’s Suprematism,"The study addresses some aspects of Suprematist theory of perception, allowing to investigate the structure of Suprematist phenomenon in the context of ontology, socio-political and religious-mystical works of K. Malevich. The aim of the paper is to present Malevich’s theory of perception in the framework of enactivism. Namely, the article focuses on the theory of social affordances, which today is widely used in design, game development and other everyday practices. The author refers to Malevich’s theoretical and sociopolitical essays, as well as to the commentary literature. Although Suprematism represents a well-researched tradition in art theory, the author stress the need for a follow-up study of Malevich’s theoretical essays in the contemporary context of philosophy of consciousness. The author also emphasizes the relevance of Suprematist philosophy for today’s way of thinking. For the most authentic presentation of Malevich’s ideas I use the phenomenological and hermeneutical method on a par with elements of the ecological approach in psychology and enactivism in the philosophy of consciousness. Consequently, the theory of affordances an effective and natural unification of all the aspects discussed above. The study shows the affinity of Malevich’s ideas to this theory. The author focused on the thesis of feeling as the goal of the expressive act of art. As one could see, Kazemir Malevich always emphasized the bodily-affective dimension of art, and in this sense he participated in a global cultural-historical shift in our conception of the essence of art. Since then, art has ceased to be elitist, but has instead inherited everyday practices. Thus, Malevich speaks of a new art that suits the man of the new world, the Soviet citizen. In this context, I relate the idea of affordance, which means the creation of a feeling-opportunity for subjective action (agency), to the artistic act whose goal, according to Malevich, is the creation of an emotional body-affective feeling. I defend the theory of social affordances, explaining the mechanism of social interaction, as the most adequate model for explaining Suprematism. As a result, based on the already developed concept of bodily-affective dynamics, I show how visionary and creative Malevich was, and how his ideas contribute to the development of a theory of social, emotional affordances.",2023.0,2023-09-15,0,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0046e4662fdeab1fb510fad5e022549d8226782e

While clearly distinct, the extent to which meditation and vacation indeed have similar effects in daily life is an open question. We examined this question with beginning meditators in an eight-week A-B-A-B experimental protocol (A = not meditating; B = meditating). Community citizens and psychology students filled out daily surveys of affect and mindfulness and reported when they meditated or took vacation. On meditation days, participants reported lower levels of negative affect and higher levels of wellbeing, positive affect, and the mindfulness facets of observing sensations, describing thoughts and emotions, and nonreacting to feelings. We found similar associations of vacation with observing and nonreacting, and larger effects for well-being, positive affect, and negative affect. These results indicate that beginning meditation and vacation may indeed have overlapping effects, providing multiple pathways to boosts in well-being and mindfulness.",2020.0,2020-03-03,5,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004a2c811da9f9c556587e7483b75020aa05a7aa

10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00604,A Pilot Digital Intervention Targeting Loneliness in Youth Mental Health,"Background: Loneliness is an emerging issue for young people, but yet many interventions to address loneliness in this group focus on providing social opportunities. While these sorts of interventions may appear to increase social connections, loneliness is more related to quality rather than quantity of social relationships. Thus, interventions addressing loneliness should focus on maximizing the quality of current relationships. Together with youth consumers both with mental ill health and those without, we developed a digital smartphone application (app) called +Connect. The 6-week program delivers positive psychology content designed to improve relationship quality. We tested the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of the program in lonely young people with or without a mental health diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. We used a mixed method study design to triangulate pilot quantitative and qualitative data in young people with and without social anxiety disorder (SAD). Method: Nine participants with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (M age = 21.00; SD = 1.41) and 11 participants with no mental health conditions (M age = 20.36; SD = 2.16) completed the +Connect digital intervention. Results: Those with social anxiety disorder reported less acceptable ratings on outcomes. Feasibility ratings, measured by uptake and app completion, met a priori threshold criteria in both groups. Those with social anxiety disorder yielded more attrition, with almost double the attrition rate compared with those without the disorder. There were no safety issues elicited during the pilot study. In terms of outcomes, exploratory analyses indicated that the app itself is likely to be beneficial rather than cause harm. Our qualitative data indicated both groups reported no negative outcomes and noted that positive outcomes were driven by three processes: reflection, learning, and real-life application. Further exploratory data on usability indicated room for improvement in terms of giving more support for different components of the app (i.e., challenges). Conclusion: The pilot findings of this proof-of-concept app indicates some promise in terms of a second iterative version of +Connect.",2019.0,2019-08-23,79,63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005885768e3debbfcca326ccccbe316c02d86494

Tourism destination marketing has been an heated focus in tourism and hospitality academia, it is widely believed that it can promote the revival of industries in the post-pandemic era. But there is a lack of research on different graphic presentation forms in tourism advertisements. To bridge the gap in the related literature, this study aims at studying the impact of the image and text presentation forms of the scenic spot’s name in tourism advertisements on tourists’ visit intention to the tourist destination city by combining the theory of constructivism in cognitive psychology, SOR model, and affective-cognitive model to conduct a 2 × 2 between-group experiment. The study found that when the text part contains the scenic spot’s name, the tourism advertisement has a significant impact on tourists’ perceived advertising effectiveness, destination affective image, and visit intention. The results of eye tracking analysis also showed that fixation points are primarily distributed in the text part. Furthermore, this study explored the chain mediating mechanism of perceived advertising effectiveness and destination affective image and discovered that the impact of the text presentation form on the visit intention can be realized through the mediating effect of perceived advertising effectiveness and destination affective image. This study puts forward some suggestions for the tourism advertising and destination marketing of scenic spots with high-familiarity of destination cities with low-familiarity and improving the image of tourist destination cities.",2022.0,2022-12-02,6,140,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0059f6b81ceaf531167503042ca99d37f66a79ec

10.1093/ijnp/pyaa012,Obituary: Bruce McEwen,"Bruce McEwen was born in Fort Collins, Colorado January 17th 1938. He died suddenly following a brief illness on January 2nd of 2020. Between those dates he forever changed way we think of the relation between our brain and our circumstance. He will be forever remembered for an unprecedented ability for integrative science that bridged the biological and social sciences, and rendered neuroscience relevant to our discussions of health policy and social justice. Bruce had an astoundingly productive career of near 1400 publications, countless awards, and prominence (he was a past President of the Society for Neuroscience). But for those of us fortunate to know him well, the dominant memory is of Bruce’s good humor, generosity, modesty and humanity. To know him, even casually, was to understand how we feel that Bruce McEwen the person transcended Bruce McEwen scientist hard as that is to imagine. Bruce was raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan and pursued a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Oberlin College and a Ph.D. in cell biology from Rockefeller University studying energy metabolism in the cell nuclei in relation to RNA synthesis. Bruce’s early career path was influenced by the fascination of his mentor, Alfred Mirsky, with the potential for environmental regulation of gene expression, a topic that would remain at the core of McEwen lab science. Following post-doctoral studies at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, he became an Assistant Professor at Rockefeller in the team of Neal Miller, one of the leading figures of the day in psychology, who was captivated by the potential for research in “behavioral medicine.” Bruce would often recount how these and other experiences had forged the path by which he became a “molecular sociologist.” Bruce’s training provided a vision for the integration of cell and molecular biology with the social sciences and, ultimately, the study of health across the lifespan. It was Bruce’s science that brought that vision scientifically to life. Indeed, even more impressive than the volume of Bruce’s outstanding science was its breadth and impact. The legacy of the McEwen lab at The Rockefeller Universitythe emergence of the neuroscience of stressderives from Bruce’s discovery of corticosteroid receptors in the brain. This finding provided a mechanism whereby the classic stressrelated endocrine signal could act in the brain. And not just the hypothalamus – the primary region identified in Bruce’s analyses was the hippocampus. This finding would ultimately provide the basis for a biological unification of the “body” and “brain” in the organism’s response to environmental conditions. But not without some dissention. Ron de Kloet, an emerging star in steroid biochemistry, wrote to Bruce that he had been unable to replicate the corticosteroid retention in the brain using dexamethasone, a potent synthetic ligand for the glucocorticoid receptor. Many would have dismissed this as an anomaly, technical artifact, etc. Not Bruce. His response was to invite Ron to spend time at Rockefeller. The result was a series of landmark papers on the biochemistry of corticosteroid receptors. As an aside, Ron and his lab latter showed that dexamethasone does not readily gain access to the brain, thus explaining the initial discrepancy. The story reveals much about Bruce’s character. Despite the ultimate impact of the neural glucocorticoid receptor system, much of the research in Bruce’s lab in the 1970’s focused on estrogen and progesterone receptors, and the topic of sexual differentiation. Bruce’s lab was the site for the development of assays that successfully extracted steroid receptors from chromatin in isolated brain regions, thus allowing for an identification of region-specific, nuclear steroid signaling. This period featured the identification of the mechanisms for the sexual differentiation of the neural control of gonadal function and behavior revealed by a stream of remarkable research fellows under Bruce’s tutelage. The subsequent research on the lifelong effects of gonadal hormones on synaptic plasticity through both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms was yet another fascinating dimension to the orchestration of synaptic remodeling by steroid hormones. The emphasis on stress and corticosteroid receptor signaling in the brain re-emerged brilliantly in the early 1980’s as Robert Sapolsky launched his remarkable career under Bruce’s supervision. The resulting research revealed a cascade whereby applyparastyle ""fig//caption/p[1]"" parastyle ""FigCapt"" applyparastyle ""fig"" parastyle ""Figure""",2020.0,2020-02-01,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005b6d41e6829430bd882d2ebbaf330da2efd2cc

However, it is hard for psychologists to remain apprised of best practices as methodological developments accumulate. To address this, this current paper offers a selective review of advances in Likert scale development that have occurred over the past 25 years. We reviewed six major measurement journals (e.g., Psychological Methods, Educational, and Psychological Measurement) between the years 1995–2019 and identified key advances, ultimately including 40 papers and offering written summaries of each. We supplemented this review with an in-depth discussion of five particular advances: (1) conceptions of construct validity, (2) creating better construct definitions, (3) readability tests for generating items, (4) alternative measures of precision [e.g., coefficient omega and item response theory (IRT) information], and (5) ant colony optimization (ACO) for creating short forms.

However, as society develops, teen pregnancy, juvenile sexual offending, and the widespread of STI, all turn on the red warning light for attention to sex education. There are limited Chinese studies on this topic. Some of them lack data proof on the delay of sex education, and some of them lack practical suggestions for the future. Consequently, this study will use questionnaires and interviews based on Qiushi Middle School to collect original data and analyses data to prove if the delay is existing in Chinese sex education. The study finds out that sex education delays for girls obviously from physiology and psychology, and sex education delays for boys insignificantly, as boys’ physiological maturity is two years later than girls’ that is at junior high school. However, boys’ psychological awareness of sex still begins at elementary school. Therefore, designing the sex education curriculum separately for girls and boys is strongly recommended. For decreasing juvenile sexual offending, teen pregnancy and the spreading of STI, a continuous curriculum from daycare to university is suggested to design.

Through this theoretical-experiential workshop, the facilitators bring the power of the body from a multidisciplinary and creative perspective; invite participants to share the experience of rooting and connecting with the pulse of life, through art, dance and rescuing the bond with nature. This article emphasizes the development of the methodology, with a detailed account of the proposed experience. It is believed that its relevance lies in the possibility of becoming a reference as an intervention instrument for multidisciplinary psychocorporal groups.Keywords: Bioenergetics; Biodanza; Art therapy; Theoretical-Experiential Workshop; PICS.",2022.0,2022-11-30,0,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0060a4010fbd0794ca004c0951fa63e8d6663f84

We further aimed to develop additional knowledge within this team to help identify, assess and support people who may be neurodivergent with a primary focus on autism. Methods Starting in September 2022 the team completed a survey to understand baseline knowledge. Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) quality improvement cycles were then used to develop resources and disseminate knowledge within the team to help target the identified staff development areas. Following implementation the team completed a further survey to reassess the changes and ongoing areas of focus and to guide ongoing skill development. Results 3 PDSA cycles were completed with interventions including collecting data on local services to share within the team, collating these resources and sourcing training sessions. This demonstrated an improvement in many areas at the point of the second survey at which stage the team showed a better understanding of how to access autism assessments, the role of various local autism specific teams including admission avoidance urgent support processes and confidence in supporting people after diagnosis. Work continued following the second survey within the team with further training sessions and both medical and psychology colleagues upskilling to be able to complete autism assessments within our service in conjunction with the neurodevelopmental team. The early intervention team staff have been able to utilise the support of many of these services and often discuss these options now within team meetings. Conclusion Initially support and knowledge gaps were identified within our team and work was done to collect and share information about local services and processes to best allow us to support those within our psychosis service who also have an autism spectrum condition and this has been successfully implemented. This work has grown over the past 2–3 years since the initial quality improvement work was developed and team knowledge has since continued to grow. This has included multiple team members now also being able to complete autism assessments formally in conjunction with the neurodevelopmental service with some assessments now finalised and significant ongoing work to improve experiences of those with both autism and psychosis.",2024.0,2024-06-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0066a61771fca84c4a094647a7719e8172219faf

10.24839/2325-7342.jn24.3.159,Social Distancing Individuals With Depression: The Impact of Symptom Severity,"COPYRIGHT 2019 BY PSI CHI, THE INTERNATIONAL HONOR SOCIETY IN PSYCHOLOGY (VOL. 24, NO. 3/ISSN 2325-7342) Depression, or major depressive disorder (MDD), is the most common mental disorder within the United States of America (National Institute of Mental Health, 2019). In 2017 alone, around 17.3 million adults age 18 or older experienced at least one major depressive episode. Unfortunately, people with depression often experience stigma. People may develop stigmatizing attitudes by believing myths such as “All people with mental disorders are dangerous” or “People with mental illness can just ‘get over’ their ailment” (Anderson, Jeon, Blenner, Wiener, & Hope, 2015). Stigmatization includes using stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, all of which degrade the individual who is being stigmatized (Hinshaw, 2005). Stigmatization of mental illness is expressed among medical workers and can lead to differentiated, lower quality care of patients with mental illness in a hospital setting (Cheng, Poon, Nguyen, Woodman, & Parker, 2013; Liekins et al., 2012; Minas, Zamzam, Midin, & Cohen, 2011) and self­stigmatization (Overton & Medina, 2008). Self­stigmatization in turn leads to more depressive thoughts and shaky self­confidence (Kao et al., 2016). Consequently, people with depression who tend to stigmatize their own con­ dition have a higher likelihood of rejecting help from therapists or other treatment approaches (Campbell et al., 2016).

There is almost no academic investigation as to what drives the investment hypothesis in wearable technologies. This paper seeks to examine this issue from an evidence-based perspective. There is a fundamental disconnect in how consumers view wearable sensors and how companies market them; this is called The Baetylus Theorem where people believe (falsely) that by buying a wearable sensor they will receive health benefit; data suggest that this is not the case. This idea is grounded social constructs, psychological theories and marketing approaches. A marketing proposal that fails to recognize The Baetylus Theorem and how it can be integrated into a business offering has not optimized its competitive advantage. More importantly, consumers should not falsely believe that purchasing a wearable technology, improves health.",2016.0,2016-07-28,15,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000199325c94694e3aa482c5c9a7e4280c211370
10.1093/ASJOF/OJAA042,Commentary on: Practice Management Knowledge Amongst Plastic Surgery Residents in Canada: A National Survey,"In the article titled Practice Management Knowledge Amongst Plastic Surgery Residents of Canada: A National Survey, 1 the authors perform a critical survey assessing knowledge of business and practice management's core principles among plastic and reconstructive surgery trainees. The study assesses competency in the eight-core principles defined by Zarrabi 2 : healthcare marketing, business operations, human resource management, negotiation, insurance medical law, coding and billing, medical record management, finance, and accounting. The results of the survey had two important findings. First, respondents reported a strong desire for future training in business and practice management. Secondly, very few participants reported receiving any business training throughout their residency. Thus, the survey revealed both a desire for education in the competencies related to business practice and management, and also a gap in educational knowledge in the Canadian plastic surgery training system. National societies have previously tried and failed to address this gap in the curriculum. The inability to implement this curriculum change informally suggests that residency programs in North America ought to adopt a standardized business and practice management curriculum. This may improve healthcare delivery, quality, and efficiency long term. Direct applications of a business and practice management curriculum include: the allocation of scarce resources; improve the management of both private and academic plastic surgery practices; and will ultimately improve patient satisfaction, career satisfaction, and an improved plastic surgery society. This paper's authors deserve recognition for asking this very important question: are we adequately preparing graduating residents to take on business and practice management? The answer to this question was obvious: we can do better, and we will.",2020.0,2020-09-01,0,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d5a75e3ef227501ce1dd0a2c5dbe45ad4a49

Result showed that ‘the government participation in social marketing practice on sex commercialization has to a ‘very low extent’, reduced the risk of sex related diseases, the danger of ripping practice and the menace of baby trafficking factories caused by sex-commercialization in Nigeria’.

In this study, branding theory is used to analyze the formation of a tagline for local pride or pride in Indonesian-made products. The results of this study illustrate that the local pride campaign which is influenced by the practice of cross-industry collaboration with influencers is able to build brand personality for local shoe products towards consumer buying interest. The level of consumer ethnocentrism in the community forms brand awareness which has a significant effect on purchasing decisions for local shoe products, this is also in line with government policy through restrictions on imported commodities for products or goods that can be made domestically. The use of digital marketing content carried out by local products with the theme of being made proud of Indonesian products becomes a brand campaign through the hashtag #LocalPride to increase sales of local shoes (footwear) products, as well as a promotional tool that has proven to be very effective in increasing the number of followers of social media accounts.",2021.0,2021-08-01,6,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0003a7aff03057181b782d83492217adf3d00418

However, it is best known for the murals that are painted every year anew by invited artists on the facades of old town houses. Founded in 1978, the Arts Festival or Cultural Moussem of Asilah qualifies as the first street art festival in Morocco and has significantly shaped the cultural context for arts to interact with public spaces. It has, in particular, linked street art manifestations to ideas of cultural dialogue and south-south alliances as well as to urban regeneration and social development. At the same time, the Festival has been criticized for using the integrative concept of the moussem, a traditional communal festivity, for cultural marketing and for connecting arts and culture to the power of the monarchy. By focusing on political, aesthetic, and urban aspects of the institutionalization of the Asilah Festival, this article draws a genealogical perspective on entanglements of art, public culture, and urban politics in Morocco.

Drawing on recent discussions on corporate irresponsibility and institutional work in markets, this article employs a discourse analysis to examine marketing managers’ strategies to legitimise food waste generation in the organisation of retail.

Simple stratified random sampling was used with the optimum allocation method to select cultural resource sites. Stirling index was used where Simpson measured variation of cultural resources and balanced 'ex-ante' of various cultural products into a single indicator. The results show that cultural resources influence the destination brand equity efficacy on main brand aspects.

More advanced, global and graded nutrient profiling systems (NPSs) are needed to substantiate different national nutrition policies. The objective of this work was to extend Choices NPS to identify five levels of the healthiness of food products, so that the Choices NPS can also be used to support other nutrition policies, next to front-of-pack labelling. Based on the same principles as the previous logo criteria, four sets of threshold criteria were determined using a combination of compliance levels, calculated from a large international food group-specific database, the Choices logo criteria, and WHO-NPSs developed to restrict marketing to children. Validation consisted of a comparison with indicator foods from food-based dietary guidelines from various countries. Some thresholds were adjusted after the validation, e.g., because intermediate thresholds were too lenient. This resulted in a new international NPS that can be applied to different contexts and to support a variety of health policies, to prevent both undernutrition and obesity. It can efficiently evaluate mixed food products and represents a flexible tool, applicable in various settings and populations.",2021.0,2021-12-01,6,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00109fa7788c5afc8d9adc33111488d4a1e3af38

Identifying instructional materials that reflect the translation of effective practices is challenging, (Solari et al., 2020) and made trickier by an abundance of commercialized and packaged literacy curricula, all claiming to be research‐ or evidence‐based. The tasks of finding, selecting, and implementing literacy interventions that are high‐quality, evidence‐based, and designed to meet the needs of students is not for the faint of heart, especially because school leaders often have difficulty distinguishing programs based on research evidence from those benefiting from good marketing (Schwartz, 2019).

10.3390/su16135729,Optimal Shoot Mass for Propagation to Increase the Yield and Quality of Pineapple,"This study investigates the impact of shoot mass on the growth, flowering, and yield of pineapple plants in two consecutive crops (2019–2020 and 2020–2021). Four treatments with varying shoot masses (200–300 g, 350–400 g, 450–500 g, >500 g) were analyzed for their flowering time, fruit harvesting, and yield parameters. To induce flowering, Ethrel was applied at a concentration of 0.4%. Each shoot was treated with 20–25 mL of Ethrel, resulting in synchronized flowering in the pineapples. The experiment employed a complete randomized block design (RCBD) comprising four treatments. The results reveal that bigger shoot masses lead to earlier flowering and a shorter time for fruit harvesting, ranging from mid-February to early July. Furthermore, this study explored the yield factors, showing that shoot masses of 350–500 g consistently result in higher harvest numbers, fruit weights, and theoretical yields. The influence of shoot mass on fruit quality parameters, including size, biochemical composition, and edibility, was also examined. Notably, smaller shoot masses are associated with higher dry matter, vitamin C, sugar, and brix levels, indicating superior quality. The findings suggest that optimizing shoot mass could significantly impact the pineapple cultivation timeline, yield, and fruit quality, providing valuable insights for pineapple farmers and cultivators. These findings carry profound implications for pineapple cultivation practices and market strategies. By optimizing shoot mass, growers can strategically adjust planting schedules to capitalize on favorable flowering and harvesting periods, potentially enhancing market competitiveness. Moreover, the insights gleaned regarding fruit quality parameters offer avenues for targeted marketing strategies, catering to discerning consumer preferences for superior-quality produce. Thus, this study not only advances scientific understanding but also provides actionable insights that could revolutionize pineapple cultivation practices and market positioning strategies, ultimately benefiting farmers and cultivators alike.",2024.0,2024-07-04,2,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0021530e37515fda008115c1eebf5e9ffa84044d

El sector del transporte es esencial para soportar el desarrollo económico y social de los países, además de ser una fuente de empleo, permite conectar a las personas con los servicios esenciales, como la educación y la salud. La investigación tiene como objetivo analizar la situación actual en lo referente a marketing digital aplicado por las empresas de transporte interprovincial ecuatorianas, así como proponer estrategias de marketing digital para incrementar el flujo de pasajeros de las empresas y compañías de transporte interprovincial que operan en el Ecuador. Para ello, se entrevistó a 15 gerentes, administradores y lideres de las operadoras de transporte, y se aplicó un cuestionario a 385 usuarios de transporte interprovincial. Los resultados indican que las empresas de transporte interprovincial poseen poco posicionamiento en redes sociales y aquellas que tienen páginas web no cuentan con portales atractivos que permitan la interacción con sus usuarios.  Se concluye que la realidad del mercado y el marketing digital de las empresas de transporte terrestre que operan en el Ecuador, no cuentan con una verdadera publicidad digital, ni un buen aprovechamiento de los recursos digitales perdiendo oportunidades de incrementar sus ventas y mejorar sus servicios.

Using the SERVQUAL services model to analyze quality of services by descriptive statistics method. This study was conducted using 200 respondents selected by purposive. Tangible, empathy, responsiveness, reliability, and assurance (Service Quality Dimensions) were the variables considered for this study. The research found that reliability and responsiveness (not empathy, tangibility, and assurance) impact consumer satisfaction which increases the frequency of purchasing. It explains, a negative relationship between satisfaction and loyalty intensions. Furthermore, both loyalty and satisfaction effects weaken with increased prior consumption experiences, related on organizational issues. Thus, when the customers invest in satisfaction, managers should consider their individual marginal impacts on loyalty and distinguish between consumers with reference to their prior consumption experiences. The managerial implication in marketing strategies to increase customer loyalty, consumer satisfaction is directly related to provide fast, precise, and friendly services in accordance with established service standards. Moreover, the research study concludes that image of a service provider, loyalty of consumers, consumer expectations, perceived value, perceived quality and the way complains are handled are very important factors that determine consumer loyalty levels.",2019.0,2019-08-31,7,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0038935dbbf5b88f82d176692b5b4939be128dbc

10.2478/njms-2023-0010,The language of late fossil capital,"ABSTRACT This essay studies the propaganda language of contemporary – or late – fossil capital. Whereas the traditional understanding of propaganda focuses on the dissemination of information (or disinformation) in order to promote a political cause or ideology, I argue that the main form and vehicle of propaganda for late fossil capital is the massive use of terms and tropes, together with particular rhetorical devices, for example, the interpellation of the individual consumer as responsible for mitigating climate change. The essay studies the language of fossil capital based primarily on marketing material by fossil fuel companies, in the US and other Western countries, such as advertising and advertorials, current and archived websites, social media, corporate sustainability reports, as well as material produced by industry organisation such as the American Petroleum Institute and the Heartland Institute. A large part of the material is taken from two North American legal complaints, Connecticut v. Exxon Mobil Corporation (2020) and City of New York v. Exxon Mobil Corp. et al.

10.3174/ajnr.A5259,Reply:,"We thank Dr Haller for his recent letter regarding our publication, “Predictive Utility of Marketed Volumetric Software Tools in Subjects at Risk for Alzheimer Disease: Do Regions Outside the Hippocampus Matter?” We restricted our study to NeuroQuant (CorTechs Labs, San Diego, California) and Neuroreader (Brainreader, Horsens, Denmark) because they have received FDA 510(k) marketing clearance and physicians are likely to use them in everyday practice. Also, these packages use a probabilistic atlas-based segmentation on non-uniformity-corrected 3D T1-weighted images to derive absolute volumes of a variety of cortical and subcortical structures (and are not voxel-based morphometry– derived gray matter concentrations, as stated by Dr Haller). We fully agree with Dr Haller that areas outside the medial temporal lobe play a role in the evolution of Alzheimer disease (AD); indeed, we and others have previously documented the value of using multiple markers, including other brain regions. Nevertheless, the earliest synaptic lesions in AD are thought to be in the medial temporal lobe, and MR imaging hippocampal volumes are one of the markers used in newer diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Clearly, MCI and dementia are heterogeneous in their pathology, presentation, and outcomes; using multiple anatomic and molecular biomarkers will no doubt help us better personalize diagnosis and therapy.",2017.0,2017-09-01,0,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003d443e35cf2d0425f4a0bba76355278674e2c9
10.3390/su14053073,Sustainable Tourism Destination Image Projection: The Inter-Influences between DMOs and Tourists,"With the development of the Web 2.0 era, tourists can freely publish their destination experiences through online travel notes. This enables tourists to become important agents to project tourism destination image (TDI), impacting destination-sustainable development. Previous studies have compared the difference in the images projected by destination management organizations (DMO) and tourists through their published content. However, fewer studies have been done to explore the inter-influences between them on the diachronic process of TDI construction. From the perspective of “circle of representation” this question is researched through a case study of Chiang Mai, Thailand, regarding the market of mainland Chinese tourists. Through interviews and the collection of microblogs from the Thailand National Tourism Bureau and tourists’ travel notes from 2009 to 2021, we found that Chiang Mai has experienced four stages of TDI construction, during which the “Xiao Qingxin” image is evolutionally constructed and formed into the representation circle. The inter-influences between DMO and tourists, as well as the influencing factors in this process, are summarized. Our study supplements a dynamic diachronic analysis of TDI from the constructivism perspective. Relevant management and marketing applications for TDI and destination sustainability in the post-pandemic and Web 2.0 era are also provided.",2022.0,2022-03-06,8,73,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003d6fafea53f99a5d0b45a606463879f31dc362

10.1101/785014,Virtual reality as a tool for environmental conservation and fundraising,"Anecdotal evidence from philanthropic fundraisers shows that virtual reality (VR) technology increases empathy and can influence people toward pro-environmental behavior. Non-profit organizations are increasingly marketing their causes using virtual reality and they report increased donations when VR technology is employed. In VR, users are immersed in situations intended to feel more like the real world through technology, such as 360° video screened through 3D headsets that block out visual and auditory distractions. The framing of the message as either positive or negative has long shown to have an effect on behavior, although consensus on the impact of framing has not been reached in relation to encouraging contributions to public goods. This paper focuses on field experiments used to investigate the effects of varying degrees of visual immersion and positive versus negative message framing on respondents’ contributions to a conservation charity. Participants were exposed to a five-minute underwater film about coral reefs and the importance of protecting them. We employed a 2×2 experimental design using 3D head-mounted displays comparing 360° film footage vs. unidirectional film and a positive message vs. a negative message. After watching the film, each participant completed a short questionnaire and had the opportunity to donate to a marine conservation charity. In addition, we tested a control treatment where no video was observed. The video was filmed in Indonesia which is host to some of the world’s most biodiverse reefs that are under great threat from human activity. We also conducted the study in Indonesia, sampling a total of 1006 participants from the Bogor city area and tourists on the island of Gili Trawangan - which is popular for scuba diving and snorkeling. We find significant differences in observed behavior and reported emotions between all treatments compared to the control condition. Among the tourist sample, we find significant differences between the 360° film with a negative message which garnered significantly larger average donation amounts compared to the unidirectional film with both positive and negative framing. Overall, we can infer from these studies that virtual reality is an effective way to raise awareness of environmental threats and encourage behavioral action, especially when tailored to target groups. New technology, such as the VR head-mounted display, is highly effective at attracting interest which is an important point to encourage organizations to invest in new technologies.",2019.0,2019-10-04,83,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0043abb025ad0e6dc4cbc33a3e0cc517f097b20b

10.7895/ijadr.443,Global alcohol policy implementation in Thailand: A narrative review,"Alcohol consumption is growing in emerging economies. Thailand is an upper-middle-income emerging economy in Southeast Asia where the alcohol market has been under an oligopoly, which political groups are attempting to amend. The Thai Ministry of Public Health works in close partnership with the non-profit sector in alcohol control, and has recently adapted the World Health Organization’s (WHO) SAFER initiatives as part of the national alcohol agenda. In light of these ongoing changes, we conducted a narrative review with the following objectives: (1) to describe the development of alcohol control policy strategies in Thailand; and (2) to describe the current situation on alcohol policy implementation. We performed a search of the published and grey literature in both Thai and English languages using keywords related to topics of interest, and reviewed data on SAFER's effectiveness using a group of indicators (policy-attributable health outcomes). We found that Thailand has laws and regulations covering various domains of SAFER. However, gaps do exist with regard to regulation of alcohol outlet density, relatively low alcohol sales permit fees, control of online and surrogate marketing of alcoholic products, and enforcement of drinking-and-driving deterrence measures, among others. A review of the indicators showed that annual per capita alcohol consumption (APC) and prevalence of drinkers have remained constant since 2008, whereas the prevalence of binge-drinking has been on a decline since 2014. However, deaths attributable to alcohol have increased in both men and women. The findings of this narrative review may have implications for policymakers and stakeholders in behavioral health.",2024.0,2024-05-17,2,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00451545107249c33632802573e399530b25a53b

It investigates how the purchase behavior of Iranian consumers is affected by different aspects of perceived risk, such as financial, performance, psychological, and social risks. This study uses the four main concepts of ‘Perceived Risk’ (PR), ‘Attitude towards Green Products’ (AGP), ‘Price Sensitivity’ (PS), and ‘Green Purchase Behavior’(GPB) to develop a model to increase green purchase intention. This research uses an experimental study, using a survey method (questionnaire distribution)to confirm the hypotheses and discover its management concepts, and uses Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results show that the variable of “Perceived Risk” has a positive effect on “Attitude towards Green Products” and “Price Sensitivity”. “Attitude towards Green Products” has a positive effect on “green purchasing behavior” while “Price Sensitivity” has a negative effect on “green purchasing behavior”. This study focuses on existing literature by providing experimental evidence showing the importance of green consumption in the Iranian industry. The present model provides valuable input to policymakers and marketers to work from the perspective of policies and green marketing strategies and the research framework of purchasing green products to preserve the environment and the prevalence of green consumption among consumers.",2023.0,2023-10-10,4,71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00463bcef26fe5c83152ac9b987d4eb4c89fa457

10.22161/IJAERS.68.8,Influence on the Productivity of Ethanol by two Strains of Yeasts in must Fermentation of Sweet Sorghum,"— Currently, the world's energetic matrix is in a modification, resulting from the worsening global warming. In this scenario, Brazil presents the generation of electric energy through Hydro consolidated, as well as the ethanol in gasoline replacement in vehicles. This biofuel is produced from the ethanolic fermentation of sugar cane juice or residual molasses of sugar manufacturing. With the high marketing of ""flex-fuel"" cars in the country, it is estimated that the demand will increase considerably, being necessary to the expansion of sugar cane plantations, or the use of other raw materials that can complement the production. In this context, the sweet sorghum outstands, which have been studied by presenting short vegetative cycle, high-yield in ethanol per area, co-generation from bagasse burning, the possibility of mechanization, besides being cultivated in sugar cane plantations renewal areas. Considering that sweet sorghum is a relatively new crop, there is a lack of information in the literature concerning the ethanol production process. In this sense, one can cite even the behavior of different strains of yeasts in the ethanolic fermentation of sweet sorghum juice and the characteristics of the resulting wine. In this way, the objective of this work was to assess the influence of yeast strains PE-2 and BG-1 in the must fermentation process of sweet sorghum, it was observed that the raw material offers levels of sugars suitable for industrial processing, and the PE-2 adapt more easily to the must sweet sorghum than the BG-1, producing high alcoholic content.",2019.0,2019-08-10,0,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0056a5fca86fedd328e216161e9c1705522b870f

Therefore, the study sought to measure perceptions of membership and the drivers of membership commitment of cocoa farmers' cooperative societies in the Atwima Mponua District of Ashanti Region, Ghana. Data was collected from a sample of 400 cocoa farmers through a multi-stage sampling technique. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (binary logit regression) were used in analyzing the data. Results show that cocoa farmers agree that they benefit from the cooperative and they appreciate the management, marketing and business, internal dynamics and public interest of their cooperatives. The study also discovered that farm age, access to extension service, farming experience, farmer status, cooperative benefits and internal dynamics are critical to obtaining commitment in cooperative societies.

10.4103/0976-500X.184768,"Expedited drug review process: Fast, but flawed","The United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) defines Fast Track as a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is further defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially superior to existing therapy. This was introduced to curtail the duration in drug regulation and approval process, and to facilitate the discovery and marketing of drugs targeted for serious or rare diseases and to accelerate the approval of molecules showing superior efficacy than the existing one. Fast-track approach was introduced in 1988; a sponsor can apply for fast-track drug approval process along with investigational new drug application. The FDA conveys the decision within sixty calendar days to the sponsor about fast-track consideration. When a drug is accredited with the fast-track process, it enables investigators to work along with FDA to conduct the trial and to submit the relevant data.

10.24193/JSSPSI.2021.8.04,Silver Tourism and Recreational Activities as Possible Factors to Support Active Ageing and the Resilience of the Tourism Sector,"""Population ageing, affecting both developed and developing countries nowadays, poses new challenges but also represents an opportunity for socio-economic systems in general, and in particular for tourism and recreation. In the light of the recently designed EU silver economy policies, active ageing shapes itself to be an attractive opportunity for the European leisure market. Seriously affected by the COVID-19 health crisis, the tourism sector’s resilience depends on the hospitality industry’s capacity to adapt, innovate, and respond to society’s new demographic challenges. Consequently, new types and forms of tourism and new service technologies should be implemented having in mind an ageing population. This paper used as the main research tool a survey on Bucharest residents aged 65 and over, aiming to identify their main preferences and limitations regarding recreational activities and leisure tourism. The main results identify similarities and differences to findings on European silver tourists and could be further valued by better adapted holiday packages and tourism marketing strategies for Romania. The present research emphasised differences in senior travel preferences and a possible segmentation of silver tourists in Romania (e.g. based on their income, education level), highly suggesting that the elderly’s needs have to be addressed by tailor-made products.

Traditional musical instrument performance and sound production methods have made it difficult to meet the diverse needs of modern music creation. This article aims to improve the synthesis and optimization technology of tone quality by using a deep-learning algorithm. This article effectively constructs a melody model for the complex music structure of an independent encoder using the baseline of a music converter. By analyzing models with different baselines, the chord encoding part of the music structure was constructed. We constructed sound recognition by transforming and generating music under complex conditions. The results indicate that the proposed model has higher and richer key performance in the coverage of sound chords. Its model benchmark in graphic commerce has been expressed in a more diverse way. The histogram and pitch have been better reflected in the richness of performance processing.

10.12681/EML.28006,Chrysanthine theoretical thought and notation system-The relation between Orality and Textuality,"Two centuries after the release of Chrysanthos’ Εισαγωγή εις το Θεωρητικόν και Πρακτικόν της Εκκλησιαστικής Μουσικής, this treatise remains one of the most important sources of theoretical thought in the field of Greek Orthodox Ecclesiastical Music. Moreover, it is widely known that the theoretical essays of Chrysanthos played a catalytic role regarding the structure of the modal system of Octaechia, the formulation of the new Parasemantiki notation, as well as contemporary performance practices. Indeed, Chrysanthos’ contribution to the reformation of the notation system as well as the way he attributed the theoretical content of Ecclesiastical Music, influenced the entire theoretical thought that was produced, at least until the last decades of the 19th century[1]. Therefore, despite individual disagreements that were expressed within the psaltic milieu of the 19th century[2], almost all of the theoreticians who succeeded Chrysanthos based their thought on his fundamental principles. Thus, it is worth mentioning that in treatises that followed the Reform of 1814, repetitions are frequently detected, even of Chrysanthos’ points that could be considered as scientifically problematic[3].[1] See Νίκος Ανδρίκος, Η Εκκλησιαστική μουσική της Σμύρνης (1800-1922), (2015), 124.[2] About this issue, see Αντώνιος Χατζόπουλος, Η εκκλησιαστική μουσική παιδεία στην εκκλησία της Κωνσταντινουπόλεως κατά το 19ο και 20ό αιώνα, (2000); Αχιλλεύς Χαλδαιάκης, “Η διδασκαλία της Ψαλτικής Τέχνης: Παρελθόν, παρόν και μέλλον”, Βυζαντινομουσικολογικά, Τόμος Α΄, Θεωρία, (2014), 50-52.[3] Among others, the most indicative example was the repetition of Chrysanthos’ misguided calculation-measurement of the basic scale’s size. This issue became the reason of a wide discourse between important theoreticians of the 19th century through the daily and periodical press and led to the convocation of the Music Committee of 1881.

10.61707/j5yktg91,Exploring Contemporary Socio-Cultural Shifts in Ukraine and Their Effects on Strengthening National Identity and Resilience in Times of War,"Establishing a Ukrainian political nation is contingent upon a complex set of circumstances. Ukraine is compelled to wage a war against Russia for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. In such times, national self-identification becomes pivotal in consolidating efforts across all resistance fronts. The formation of Ukrainian identity is complicated by the dichotomy within Ukraine’s socio-cultural space, where Russian culture, alongside Ukrainian, has had significant influence. It has led to divisions along linguistic, historical, and religious lines and memories. This article aims to identify the main socio-cultural trends that influence the transformation of national identity and resilience in Ukraine. Constructivism serves as the principal methodological approach to the research, enabling the analysis of the critical elements of national identity during its formation and development. The research methods include document analysis and sociological data, case studies, comparison, synthesis, deduction, generalisation, and systematisation. The findings of the research indicate that the war has significantly impacted the self-identification processes of Ukrainians, hastening the decolonisation of Ukraine’s socio-cultural space. Ukrainians are creating distance from Russian influences, including its culture and cultural outputs like music, literature, and cinema. There is a notable shift towards the use of the Ukrainian language and the gradual adoption of Ukrainian and European symbols over Russian ones. These changes are fostering a more robust national identity, enhancing the societal aspect of this identity, and catalysing a shift from feelings of inferiority to a rise in national pride and patriotism. ",2024.0,2024-06-20,0,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000281a2fc98521914d7fb5fcd46cd20ea2924f4

10.31763/viperarts.v5i1.910,Development of a drama gong performance model: an effort to preserve the Balinese traditional drama in the digital era,"Drama gong is a traditional Balinese performing art that was once popular and favored by the Balinese. Since the 1990s, traditional art has been pressured with modern art, so efforts to revitalize and innovate drama gong need to be carried out. One of the efforts made by Balinese artists is to create a digital drama gong model with the name Drama Keraton Cilinaya. This qualitative descriptive study aims to determine the development model of drama gong performances in the digital era. Research data were collected through document study, participant observation, and interviews. The results of the study show that the development of the Drama Keraton Cilinaya as a model of drama gong in the digital era is a form of traditional Balinese performing arts that has undergone internal and external innovation. The internal innovations carried out involve: (1) having an open mindset towards the players; (2) innovation in terms of story packaging; (3) improving the competence of drama gong players; (4) the use of multi-language (5) the regeneration of players; (6) improvement of makeup and costumes; (7) using digital music; and (8) improvement of stage layout. External innovations were carried out regarding collaboration with artists other than drama gong to get involved, as well as the application of digital technology in the packaging process of drama gong performance products and the distribution of drama gong products to be broadcast through TV media and Youtube Channels.",2023.0,2023-06-25,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0007c75f4a4e9d5af3d30642af8a96273ee53044

Dementia patients can attend day care centers where they participate in activities such as cognitive training, music and art therapy, and physical exercise sessions. This research aimed to determine the effectiveness of simple lower limb strength and single leg stance training, feasible in the facilities of day care centers, to reduce the risk of falls in the elderly with dementia. Twenty patients with dementia were divided into intervention and control groups. They participated in mobility, strength, coordination, and balance exercise sessions for 45–50 min on weekdays for 5 weeks. In addition, the intervention group patients performed simple lower limb strength (sit-to-stands) and single leg stance exercises in every session. Risk of falls was assessed with the Tinetti test and the SPPB. Comparisons of post- and pre-intervention scores for the Tinetti test and SPPB were statistically increased (0.8 ± 0.7, p = 0.03; 1.5 ± 1.3 points, p = 0.02) in intervention patients.

The aim was to analyse effect of instrumental, background music on working memory in medical students of Indian and Malaysian origin.Age and gender matched 120 1st-year MBBS students (60 Indian and 60 Malaysian), were randomised into music and control groups equally. Music used was non vocal flute, raga malkauns. After 5 min of music/rest, working memory was assessed using Rey-Ostherrieth-complex-figure-test (ROCF). After another concentration task(SDMT) and a gap of 25min, recall of figure was assessed. Copy and recall figures were scored for 36 points.(significant p value<0.05).There was no statistical difference between copy and recall score of ROCF when compared between music and control group of both ethnicities (p=0.223). Malaysian students performed significantly better in copy and recall score compared to Indian students.Instrumental music does not seem to influence working memory, but it does not hamper it too. As a diverse population, Malaysian students are bestowed with efficient working memory than Indian students. Music has no differential influence on the working memory of the two ethnic groups. Students can be advised to use instrumental music, preferably of raga Malkauns, in background while studying which will not hamper their retention.   ",2022.0,2022-07-15,0,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0012e14785571337720823f93082dd3d93bcc20c
10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1017039,Determining factors for compensatory movements of the left arm and shoulder in violin playing,"Introduction Despite a large number of available ergonomic aids and recommendations regarding instrument positioning, violin players at any proficiency level still display a worrying incidence of task-specific complaints of incompletely understood etiology. Compensatory movement patterns of the left upper extremity form an integral part of violin playing. They are highly variable between players but remain understudied despite their relevance for task-specific health problems. Methods This study investigated individual position effects of the instrument and pre-existing biomechanical factors likely determining the degree of typical compensatory movements in the left upper extremity: (1) left elbow/upper arm adduction (“Reference Angle α”, deviation from the vertical axis), (2) shoulder elevation (“Coord x”, in mm), and (3) shoulder protraction (“Coord y”, in mm). In a group of healthy music students (N = 30, 15 m, 15 f, mean age = 22.5, SD = 2.6), “Reference Angle α” was measured by 3D motion capture analysis. “Coord x” and “Coord y” were assessed and ranked by a synchronized 2D HD video monitoring while performing a pre-defined 16-s tune under laboratory conditions. These three primary outcome variables were compared between four typical, standardized violin positions varying by their sideward orientation (“LatAx-CSP”) and/or inclination (“LoAx-HP”) by 30°, as well as the players’ usual playing position. Selected biomechanical hand parameter data were analyzed as co-factors according to Wagner’s Biomechanical Hand Measurement (BHM). Results Mean “Reference Angle α” decreased significantly from 24.84 ± 2.67 to 18.61 ± 3.12° (p < 0.001), “Coord x” from 22.54 ± 7.417 to 4.75 ± 3.488 mm (p < 0.001), and “Coord y” from 5.66 ± 3.287 to 1.94 ± 1.901) mm (p < 0.001) when increasing LatAx-CSP and LoAx-HP by 30°. Concerning the biomechanical co-factors, “Reference Angle α”, “Coord y”, but not “Coord x”, were found to be significantly increased overall, with decreasing passive supination range (r = −0.307, p = <0.001 for “Passive Supination 250 g/16Ncm”, and r = −0.194, p = <0.001 for “Coord y”). Compensatory movements were larger during tune sections requiring high positioning of the left hand and when using the small finger. Discussion Results may enable to adapt individually suitable instrument positions to minimize strenuous and potentially unhealthy compensation movements of the left upper extremity.",2023.0,2023-01-23,2,75,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00149f31e6a928b126e9e6b8ad93ed580fdd1878

10.3205/hta000063,Concepts of care for people with dementia,"Introduction Today there are approximately one million people with dementia in Germany. If current demographic trends continue, this number is likely to rise substantially in the coming years. In the older population, dementia is the most frequent reason for long-term care. Because most forms of dementia cannot be cured, the aim of treatment is to delay disease progression and to maintain functioning and quality of life. Research questions What is the evidence on different approaches to the long-term usual care of patients with dementia in terms of common endpoints such as quality of life, and social behaviour? How is the cost-effectiveness of these concepts to be evaluated? Which ethical, social, or legal issues are discussed in this context? Methods Based on a systematic literature review, we include randomized, controlled studies that had at least 30 participants and investigated one or more of the following approaches of dementia care: validation therapy/emotion-oriented usual care, ergotherapy, sensory stimulation, relaxation techniques, reality orientation therapy, and reminiscence therapy. Studies had to be published after 1996 (after 1990 for the economic part) in English or German. Results A total of 20 studies meet the inclusion criteria. Of these, three focus on validation therapy/emotion-oriented usual care, five on ergotherapy, seven on different kinds of sensory stimulation, two on reality orientation, two on reminiscence therapy, and one on a type of relaxation technique. There are no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in two of the three studies on validation therapy or emotion-oriented usual care, in two of the five studies on ergotherapy, in three of the seven studies on sensory stimulation, in both of the two studies on reminiscence therapy, and in the one study on relaxation. In the remaining ten studies, seven report some positive results in favour of the respective interventions, and three studies (ergotherapy, aroma therapy, and music/massage) report positive effects with respect to all of the endpoints measured. Six publications present economic results for usual-care-concepts. One study reports additional costs of 16 GBP (24.03 Euro (2006)) per patient per week for occupational therapie. Two publications declare incremental cost of 24.30 USD (25.62 Euro (2006)) per mini-mental-state-examination-(MMSE)-point gained per month respectively 1,380,000 ITL (506.21 Euro (2006)) per MMSE-point gained. Two publications focus on mixed interventions. One study reports the additional costs of an activity program (1.13 USD (1.39 Euro (2006)) per day per patient) and the other additional time for the usual care for mobile demented patients (average of 45 minutes per day per patient). With respect to ethical and social aspects the discussion focusses on the problem of autonomy: dementia does not necessarily mean inability to decide over the participtation in studies. Legal questions address the financial situation of patients, the organisation of their care and the legal representation of dementia patients. Discussion Only a few studies on the nursing interventions considered in this report are methodologically robust. Most of the studies have a small number of participants and show substantial differences in terms of their inclusion criteria, implementation, and endpoints. This heterogeneity is reflected in the results: in half of the studies, the interventions have no positive effects compared to the control group. The other half of the studies reports some positive effects with regard to specific endpoints. All of the economic studies are, from a methodologial and a thematic standpoint, not suitable to answer the questions raised. Ethical, social and legal aspects are discussed but not systematically analysed. Conclusion The studies conducted to date do not provide sufficient evidence of neither efficacy nor cost-effectiveness for any of the nursing interventions considered in the present HTA. However, lack of evidence does not mean lack of efficacy. Instead, more methodologically sound studies are needed. Particullary desireable are studies reflecting the framework of dementia care in Germany. This holds also for the healtheconomic evaluations of the chosen interventions.",2009.0,2009-01-06,8,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001916c6a658c9934b646732514044a76e09d5b3

10.5507/mo.2010.026,Uses of Melodrama in Massenet's Operas after Manon: Sources and Dramatic Functions,"Like Fibich, Massenet was always fascinated by the expressive power of the spoken voice. Indeed, from his very fi rst song cycle, Poème d’avril (1866), to his last opera, Cléopâtre (1912), spoken declamation regularly occurs in many of his vocal works, whether destined for the theatre (operas or stage music) or for more intimate performance spaces (chamber music, salons etc.).1 Its fi rst major, decisive use, however, dates from 1884, the year of the premiere of Manon, an opéra-comique in which spoken dialogues are consistently supported by a musical accompaniment.2 This innovation was actually much commented upon, often with reservations,3 even though it was not altogether unprecedented in France. Indeed, beginning at the end of the eighteenth century, spoken declamation could occasionally occur at certain points or constitute the vocal material of specifi c numbers, labelled “melodramas”: these can be found in very famous opéras-comiques from the previous period which probably infl uenced Manon: Giacomo Meyerbeer’s L’Étoile du Nord (1854), Ambroise Thomas’s Mignon (1866), and Georges Bizet’s Carmen (1875).4 Curiously, many reviewers were divided on the subject of the sources of the device in Manon, which admittedly contrasted with the ones used by Massenet’s predecessors owing to its highly diverse confi gurations, at variance both with one another and with traditional operatic numbers. While a few critics rightly pointed out the occasional presence",2010.0,2010-12-11,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c26ba7f982296a94d3d0ba17c698caf60d2b8

10.1097/AUD.0000000000001235,NAL-NL2 Prescriptive Targets for Bone Conduction Devices With an Adaptation to Device Constraints in the Low Frequencies,"Objectives: To study the effectivity of a transformed NAL non-linear version 2 (NAL-NL2) gain prescription for percutaneous bone conduction devices (BCDs) and to investigate how to take into account output constraints for the lower frequencies. Design: The NAL-NL2 prescription was converted to a bone conduction prescription rule. Adaptations were needed, as this converted rule prescribes more output at low frequencies than the device delivers. Three adaptations with different audibility and compression were compared. Setting 1 (S1, “optimal audibility”) had most audibility due to adapted frequency-dependent compression, setting 2 (S2, “moderate audibility”) had moderate output reduction below 1 kHz, and setting 3 (S3, “reduced audibility, least distortion”) had most output reduction. Eighteen experienced BCD users rated their relative sound quality in paired comparisons for different sounds (own voice, mixed voices, traffic noise, and music). In addition speech intelligibility in quiet and noise were assessed. Results: The relative sound quality rating for the adapted prescriptions varied between the stimuli: more low-frequency sound was preferred for music (S1 over S3), and less low-frequency sound was preferred for the own voice (S2 and S3 over S1). No differences in quality rating were found for mixed voices or traffic noise. Speech intelligibility in quiet scores at 45 dB SPL was significantly lower for S3 than for S1. Speech intelligibility in noise was significantly reduced in all settings and S3 yielded significantly better speech intelligibility in noise than S1. Conclusions: With a moderate gain reduction for low frequencies to comply with device constraints the transformed NAL-NL2 prescription was found suitable for fitting BCDs. Perceived sound quality depended on the gain settings, but also on the sound spectra and how the sound was appreciated. A moderate gain reduction below 1 kHz seems to be the optimal adaptation as it has a neutral or positive relative sound quality for all stimuli without negative effects on Speech intelligibility. The NAL-NL2-BC prescribed a sufficient amount of gain, as indicated by the speech tests.",2022.0,2022-05-30,1,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e729e39f34f9d4dfe3d1f10c69a9ca0c94c04

10.22501/jss.109621,The Imagined Sounds of Outer Space,"This essay explores how the idea of the ‘sounds of space’ has been articulated in popular culture since the late nineteenth century through the early years of the Space Age. The primary focus is on sound and music in science-fiction films from Europe, the former Soviet Union, and the United States, and the four main topic areas are the sounds of signals from space, the sounds of outer-space technology, the sounds of ‘heavenly bodies,’ and the sounds/music associated with space travel. Framing this central portion of the essay, however, is a discussion of ‘space music’ by various composers for whom writing for the cinema was perhaps one of the furthest things from their minds. The essay argues that, in terms of depictions of weightlessness, perhaps certain works by composers Arnold Schoenberg and Edgard Varèse, and by the rock groups Popol Vuh and Tangerine Dream, have something in common with the music of sci-fi cinema.",2014.0,2014-01-12,2,83,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00255e5e177f14057f4ae3197dd6176ce0457f5f

Camels can “go without” thanks in large measure to their humps, which contain up 80 pounds of fat that can be broken down into water and energy. This onboard reservoir enables them to travel up to 100 miles through the desert without water. Several other adaptations help camels thrive in dry, desert environments, where temperatures can soar to more than 100°F in summer and plummet to –20°F or colder in winter. For thousands of years, the people of North Africa and Asia have used the one-humped Arabian camels of the species Camelus dromedarius (commonly called dromedaries) for transporting people and conveying goods essential for trade and sustenance. Dromedaries, one of the largest species of domesticated livestock, may reach a shoulder height of 7 feet, and the males typically weigh between 900 and 1,300 pounds. More than serving as beasts of burden, they have also sustained human societies living in inhospitable environments as a source of meat, milk, and leather. This month’s cover art, A Rajput Warrior with Camel, Possibly Maru Ragini from a Ragamala, celebrates the longstanding relationship between humans and camels. The painting comes from India, the country at the eastern end of the range for this type of camel. Within India, these camels are concentrated in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, and smaller populations are found in the neighboring states of Gujarat and Haryana A Rajput Warrior with Camel is an example of ragamala painting, a genre that emerged in medieval India. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, “A ragamala, translated from Sanskrit as ‘garland of ragas,’ is a series of paintings depicting a range of musical melodies known as ragas. Its root word, raga, means color, mood, and delight, and the depiction of these moods was a favored subject in later Indian court paintings.” In many cases the mood, or raga, is written as poetry on the margins of the painting, and such works “express the intersections of painting, poetry, and music in Indian court art.” A ragamala typically included 36 or 42 loose-leaf paintings collected in a portfolio by members of various court circles who commissioned the work. The young warrior portrayed on the painting balances on a fallen tree trunk; his domesticated dromedary compliantly kneels before him. He holds a thin",2020.0,2020-02-01,1,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002f09dfc9a1323a15bf72e349d8b733ac97a2aa

Data collection was conducted through interviews and observations. The Kulintangan, an idiophone categorized musical instrument is a set of small kettle gongs positioned straight in a single row on two cords in a small wooden frame. There is no traditional system to notate the Kulintangan as music is passed down by tradition from generation to generation. Distinctions are found in different combinations of instruments, varying dance, tempos, tunings, and production process. While other musical instruments in Sabah are made from a natural material, the Kulintangan is made from either zinc or bronze. The process of producing Kulintangan is a highly skilled process, handed down through generation. Five tools are used to produce a set of Kulintangan. There are 6 processes in the production of the Kulintangan, from the selection of raw material to the final product.

The cognitive neural network based on T-S model is used to train the network weights with improved genetic algorithm in the paper. The strategy of membership function parameter adjustment is combined with the combination of momentum method and learning rate adaptive adjustment. The new proposed algorithm can be used in the music recognition algorithm by adding a compensation factor related to the input dimension on the membership degree, and the experimental result of the rule disaster caused by the excessive input dimension shows that the new proposed method can be applied to the music recognition system.

The study’s objective is to assess how content related to the Roma is portrayed in current curricula (N = 16) and textbooks (N = 93) for the 2022–2023 academic year. It was discovered that despite the objectives in each of the analyzed courses (Serbian language, The World around Us, Nature and Society, Music Education, and Civic Education) clearly promote equality, diversity, and mutual appreciation, democratic values, inclusion, and anti-discrimination, none of them explicitly mention the words Roma or the Roma people. Only a few times do the Roma people explicitly appear in textbooks on nature, society, and music, and then only as a numerical representation of the national minority; no mention is made of the positive traits of the Roma people, who have their own identity, tradition, and culture as well as well-known members. The results highlight the need for textbooks to include specific content about the Roma people as fundamental teaching tools.

This kind of brain signal is used for many different brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, e.g., spellers, environmental controllers, web browsers, or for painting. In recent times, BCI systems are mature enough to leave the laboratories to be used by the end-users, namely severely disabled people. Therefore, new challenges arise and the systems should be implemented and evaluated according to user-centered design (USD) guidelines. We developed and implemented a new system that utilizes the P300 pattern to compose music. Our Brain Composing system consists of three parts: the EEG acquisition device, the P300-based BCI, and the music composing software. Seventeen musical participants and one professional composer performed a copy-spelling, a copy-composing, and a free-composing task with the system. According to the USD guidelines, we investigated the efficiency, the effectiveness and subjective criteria in terms of satisfaction, enjoyment, frustration, and attractiveness. The musical participants group achieved high average accuracies: 88.24% (copy-spelling), 88.58% (copy-composing), and 76.51% (free-composing). The professional composer achieved also high accuracies: 100% (copy-spelling), 93.62% (copy-composing), and 98.20% (free-composing). General results regarding the subjective criteria evaluation were that the participants enjoyed the usage of the Brain Composing system and were highly satisfied with the system.

Thus, we intend to examine the values of (in)equality between women and men transmitted in the lyrics of this music genre. Using a Maxqda software-assisted Thematic Analysis methodology, the lyrics of 65 reggaetón songs with the most commercial success during 2020 have been analysed. The results suggest that the most commercialised reggaetón continues to reproduce certain traditional masculine stereotypes (machismo). In the discussion we compare and contrast alternative approaches and positions concerning the reggaetón genre. We feel it is necessary that educational spaces adopt a critical and consciousness raising approach to reggaetón due to the powerful influence exerted on young people regarding sexual stereotypes.",2022.0,2022-12-01,2,18,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0040815529447e9a39b2443782688669ce4f8fef

Despite recognizing the importance of spirituality within dementia care, it is still unclear how this should be integrated into dementia services. Aim To explore the perspective of health professionals regarding the spiritual care of people with advanced dementia. Methods A qualitative systematic review was performed following the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research guidelines for the study design. The inclusion criteria included original articles published from January 2008 to March 2019, using either qualitative or mixed methods. The quality of the articles included was evaluated using the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research, Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research, and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Synthesis of findings was performed using thematic analysis. Results Twelve studies were included in the review. Seventeen categories were identified, grouped into four themes: (1) the perception of spirituality, including the failure to address the same, (2) the spiritual needs of people with advanced dementia, (3) spiritual needs from health care providers, and (4) addressing spirituality, with the following categories: music, significant activities, among others. Conclusions Spirituality is not formally addressed in this population, and professionals do not feel confident enough to be able to integrate spirituality in their care.

Nevertheless, for much of the century there was serious medical discussion about the dangers of excessive music in girls' education. Many of the leading psychiatrists and gynaecologists of the nineteenth century argued that music could over-stimulate the nervous system, playing havoc with vulnerable female nerves and reproductive organs, and warned of the consequences of music lessons on the developing bodies of teenage girls. Two rival models of music's effects competed and were combined. One suggested that music led to illness by provoking sensuality, imagination and sexuality; the other argued that it was a source of neurasthenic fatigue because of intellectual strain.",2011.0,,7,58,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0048dc11b89a8db51ceab7607941879c48b55534
10.1080/02690403.2019.1651508,Notation Cultures: Towards an Ethnomusicology of Notation,"ABSTRACT The ubiquity and diversity of notational practices in music suggest that notation is a significant part of human beings’ musicking behaviour. However, it is difficult to address its function since the usual conception of notation in music scholarship is at odds with studying performance in the first place. This article presents a methodological outline for an ethnomusicology of music notation by investigating the musicality of notation not in terms of its representation of musical structures, but in terms of its mediation of the social and creative agency of musicians. It is suggested that, rather than detracting from musical reality, notation composes musical cultures. This constructive work is simultaneously ontological and ethical. It is described in terms of three distinct processes, namely mobilization, entextualization and remediation. In doing so, this article presents an interdisciplinary approach to a topic that has traditionally defined the disciplinary centre of music scholarship.",2019.0,2019-07-03,18,80,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004913f6ed4a7a026663361077cdffdad89a7e92

10.1371/journal.pone.0072500,From Understanding to Appreciating Music Cross-Culturally,"It has long been debated which aspects of music perception are universal and which are developed only after exposure to a specific musical culture. Here we investigated whether “iconic” meaning in Western music, emerging from musical information resembling qualities of objects, or qualities of abstract concepts, can be recognized cross-culturally. To this end we acquired a profile of semantic associations (such as, for example, fight, river, etc.) to Western musical pieces from each participant, and then compared these profiles across cultural groups. Results show that the association profiles between Mafa, an ethnic group from northern Cameroon, and Western listeners are different, but that the Mafa have a consistent association profile, indicating that their associations are strongly informed by their enculturation. Results also show that listeners for whom Western music is novel, but whose association profile was more similar to the mean Western music association profile also had a greater appreciation of the Western music. The data thus show that, to some degree, iconic meaning transcends cultural boundaries, with a high inter-individual variance, probably because meaning in music is prone to be overwritten by individual and cultural experience.",2013.0,2013-09-04,17,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004b8a81b2c64fb33069d6ea8fa1add6767071fb

Previous research studies focused on the application of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) in PD gait rehabilitation. The key hypothesis of this pilot study, however, assumes the major role of the combination of all three Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) sensorimotor techniques in improving spatio-temporal gait parameters, and postural stability in the course of PD. The 55 PD-diagnosed subjects invited to the study were divided into two groups: 30 in the experimental and 25 in the control group. Inclusion criteria included Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 or 3, the ability to walk independently without any aid and stable pharmacological treatment for the duration of the experiment. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the chosen therapy procedure the following measures were applied: Optoelectrical 3D Movement Analysis, System BTS Smart for gait, and Computerized Dynamic Posturography CQ Stab for stability and balance. All measures were conducted both before and after the therapy cycle. The subjects from the experimental group attended music therapy sessions four times a week for 4 weeks. Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance (TIMP), Pattern Sensory Enhancement (PSE) and RAS were used in every 45-min session for practicing daily life activities, balance, pre-gait, and gait pattern. Percussion instruments, the metronome and rhythmic music were the basis for each session. The subjects from the control group were asked to stay active and perform daily life activities between the measures. The research showed that the combination of the three NMT sensorimotor techniques can be used to improve gait and other rhythmical activities in PD rehabilitation. The results demonstrated significant improvement in the majority of the spatiotemporal gait parameters in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. In the stability tests with eyes closed, substantial differences were revealed, indicating improvement of proprioception (the sense of body position and movement). These findings suggest a new compensatory strategy for movement and postural control through the use of the auditory system.",2016.0,2016-01-26,49,84,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c5e64e9af87aceae86ee0f5c5cc16a4090944

10.4102/hts.v75i3.4969,"Faith, society and the post-secular: Private and public religion in law and theology","In pre-democratic – also pre-modern – times, religion had been at the centre of much of human life, filling the private as well as the public realm of people’s daily existence. However, with the change to democratic rule in major countries in the modern world (see, most influentially, Article 1 of the French Constitution after the French Revolution and the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, influencing all other democracies in their wake), religion has for the most part reflexively been sidelined from public life. Or has it? Does religion not still hold a special place in law in democratic societies, but now in reverse? Firstly, whereas matters of religious faith had throughout the greater part of human history been included in matters of politics, it is now as a matter of course of law excluded, purposely so. Religion is thus still a ‘special case’, a unique aspect of humanity when compared to all other matters, in law as much as in politics and other aspects of public life. Secondly, in the post-secular cultural climate dawning across the world, matters of faith (religion, spirituality) are no longer as stringently excluded from public life, which impacts directly on how religion is touched upon in law, sociology, philosophy, music and other academic disciplines too. Our dawning post-secular age is bringing something new. Two scholars, who have been doing foundational work in this regard, have done so fully in parallel, not taking cognisance of the mutualities in their academic contributions. Otto in Munich, Germany, has been combining his two areas of expertise, the Pentateuch in the Hebrew Bible and the sociologist Max Weber, to indicate the trajectory through history of democratic impulses from Ancient Near Eastern founding documents into the current era. Benson in Sydney, Australia, has on his part been drawing on his expertise in law as practised in Canada and taught in Europe, South Africa and Australia to indicate how, in inclusively liberal democracies, law cannot justifiably be used to exclude religion from the public domain, as has been the usual modern case. Drawing together these parallel contributions, Lombaard places these initiatives within the emerging post-secular climate, which augurs a different way of being religious or non-religious, publicly as much as privately, in democratic societies in our time.",2019.0,2019-10-22,9,133,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00525ecbf7627d1e356ac35ce131bf1c14d66a8f

10.3390/electronics12040824,DOA Estimation Using Deep Neural Network with Angular Sliding Window,"Deep neural network (DNN) has shown great potential in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. In high dynamic signal-to-noise (SNR) scenarios, the estimation accuracy of the weaker sources may degrade significantly due to insufficient training samples. This paper proposes a deep neural network framework with sliding window operation. The whole field-of-view (FOV) is divided into a series of sub-regions via sliding windows. Each sub-region is assumed to contain one source at most. Thus, the single-source data can be used to train all the networks, alleviating the need for the training samples and the prior information on the number of sources. A detector network and an estimator network are followed for each sub-region, enabling high estimation accuracy and the number of sources. Simulation and real data experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve excellent DOA and source number estimation performance.

Potential explanations are that watching TV is not a marker of a broader sedentary pattern and that each SB reflects different sociodemographic and health characteristics. Data were taken form a survey on 10,199 individuals, representative of the Spanish population aged ≥18 years. SB and other health behaviors were ascertained using validated questionnaires. Watching TV was the predominant SB (45.4% of the total sitting time), followed by sitting at the computer (22.7%). TV watching time showed no correlation with total time on other SB (r: -0.02, p = 0.07). By contrast, time spent at the computer was directly correlated with time spent on commuting (r: 0.07, p<0.01), listening to music (r: 0.10, p<0.01) and reading (r: 0.08, p<0.01). TV watching time was greater in those with older age, lower education, unhealthier lifestyle, and with diabetes or osteomuscular disease. More time spent at the computer or in commuting was linked to younger age, male gender, higher education and having a sedentary job. In conclusion, watching TV is not correlated with other SB and shows a distinct demographic and lifestyle profile.",2017.0,2017-12-05,26,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0058f3f605be15891f90f547b58ce2a2a363ecab

The design thinking method can be used not only in fields such as design or graphic design but also in all sectors and initiatives to solve the problems encountered with innovative approaches, from literature to music, from education to science and social life. The design thinking method was used in the process of transforming a story sack game design into a product in this research. The story sack concept, developed by Neil Griffiths in 1995, is cloth bags containing various toys and props related to the theme, providing a fun and interactive learning environment for all children from all age groups while sharing stories. In this research, literature review was conducted on the emergence processes and benefits of story sacks, which are thought to be important for child development, which encourages parents and children to create stories in an interactive way, with a design thinking approach. In the application part of the research, the Nunki Story Sack game design process, which is shaped by the use of design thinking approach, is presented as an example. Nunki Story Pack is based on the design thinking approach, which consists of five stages: empathy, definition, idea generation, prototype and testing. The story sack is designed as a story game that allows children to participate interactively, consisting of creative story cards, wooden Nunki characters, a Nunki star map made with illustration technique, and game cards.

10.16995/ah.8299,Harmonious Relationships: Sounds and Stones in Ottoman Architecture in the Making,"Architectural narratives on building processes are admittedly rare in premodern histories. Accounts of visitors who observed and reacted to architecture in the making are even more exceptional. Moreover early modern audiences’ perceptions of music and architecture have been rarely explored in relation to building processes and synesthetic experiences. This article presents a critical reading of Caʿfer Efendi’ s “Book on Architecture” (1614) by focusing on its chapter on the Sultan Ahmed mosque (1609–17) in Istanbul. First, I demonstrate how Caʿfer associated sounds in the construction site with Sufi musical practices and the science of music. Second, I show how his conversation with a Sufi reveals the ways in which twelve types of marbles, four types of strikes, and seven types of foremen were linked to Ottoman music theory. Finally, the shared geometrical foundations of architectural tools and musical instruments that produced harmonious sounds and forms is revealed. I argue that the union of spatial, visual, and aural experiences of the building in the making produced various forms of knowledge for the visitors. Architecture’s mediating role for sensuous, spiritual, and scientific knowledge further illuminates the relation between theory and practice in Ottoman architecture.

The purpose of the study is a retrospective and comparative analysis of the problem of comprehensive personal development of the future music art teacher of a new generation, based on the historical and pedagogical experience of the organization of art education in the collegiums of Left-bank Ukraine (18th-the early 19th centuries), as they laid the groundwork for the formation and development of general and professional art education; to illustrate the practical implementation of the historical and pedagogical experience of art education organization in the collegiums of Left-bank Ukraine (18th-the early 19th centuries) on the comprehensive development of the future music teacher personality in higher educational institutions. Methods. The research methods used by the author were analysis, synthesis, systematisation, comparison and generalisation. Results. Modernization of art education in Ukraine aims to improve the spiritual and creative development of personality, humanization and humanitarization of educational process in educational institutions of different types. Consequently, this requires searching for optimal approaches to the organization of art education in higher educational establishments, which would focus on the comprehensive development and professional training of future music teachers as carriers and transmitters of national culture. Conclusions. The author has noted that the analysis and creative insight into the historical and pedagogical experience of art education organization in the collegiums of the Left Bank Ukraine (18th-the early 19th centuries) determines the possibility of its use in modern higher educational institutions for comprehensive individual development of future music art teachers, which is the basis of their professional competence, teaching skills and spiritual culture. The author has presented the transformation of progressive ideas of historical and pedagogical experience of the organization of art education in the collegiums of Left-bank Ukraine (18th-the early 19th centuries). Moreover, the author has defined the forms of organizing educational and extracurricular cultural and artistic activities of future music teachers at higher pedagogical educational institutions, namely: 1) individual classes in «Additional musical instrument», «Voice production», «Choir conducting», «Main musical instrument» and group (practical) classes in artistic disciplines, which are the part of the educational program «Secondary education (Musical art)» on the training of future music teachers; 2) staging and theatricalization, which is implemented in the course of the educational discipline «Staging a children's musical performance» and organizing creative student theater groups to perform theatrical actions: 3) vocal and choral groups in an educational institution: 4) extracurricular cultural and artistic activities.",2022.0,2022-11-04,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006a029255213318d5adfd0fdd639c35424751f8

Relaxation therapy interventions are expected to help increase milk production. Purpose: The purpose of this scoping review is to map available evidence related to the effect of relaxation therapy interventions on breast milk production in postpartum mothers. Methods: In this scoping review, the authors identify studies that explain the effect of relaxation therapy on breast milk production in postpartum mothers from three databases (PubMed, Wiley, and Science Direct). Searches are limited to studies published in English and present data for the period 2010-2019. The identified study was reviewed using the PRISMA Flowchart. Studies with quantitative designs related to the effect of relaxation therapy on the production of breast milk are then selected for review. Results: From a total of four articles that have been reviewed two sub-themes are found, relaxation therapy increases milk production (increased success of breastfeeding, increased milk secretion and fat content in breast milk) and relaxation therapy decreases maternal stress levels (decreases stress scores and cortisol levels). Conclusion: From this review, some evidences shows music therapy is effective in significantly increase milk production. All studies included in the review have limitations related to the research design or sample collection procedures. The method of relaxation therapy is simple, inexpensive, and easy to use without the involvement of hospital staff. Regarding the intervention, all the intervention groups in this study showed a significant effect compared to the control group.

10.1002/jocb.555,"What Factors Influence Children's Creative Artistic Orientation? The Novel
 Children's Creative Orientation Test: Artistic","Creative orientation is the extent to which different individuals are drawn toward creative activities (e.g., art, music). We know relatively little about child-level creative orientation given certain testing limitations. Adult tools often measure time spent engaged in creative pursuits, but this method is unsuitable for children because their free time is often dictated by parents. To overcome this, we devised an entirely novel measure of creative orientation, the Children’s Creative Orientation Test: Artistic (C-COT: Artistic ). This short task, suitable for children as young as 6, elicits children’s creative urges toward artistic pursuits independently of parental inﬂuence and provides quantitative scoring. We applied our measure to over 3000 children aged 6 – 10 years, where it showed robust reliability, suggesting that creative orientation is a stable trait over time. We show that creative orientation is also inﬂuenced by classroom cohort, age, and gender but is unaffected by socio-economic status or seasonal changes (autumn vs. spring testing). We showed too that creative ori- entation converges with creative thinking (divergent thinking), creative personality (openness to experiences, especially the aesthetics subtrait), and creative engagements in the home. We present our test here in full, as a simple, fast, and robust measure of creative artistic orientation in children.",2022.0,2022-07-01,3,104,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006de0a1dbd5098752ae2eda14ede00ccef19d1c

This study investigates the role of Xi’an Drum Music in promoting literacy and cultural awareness among young learners by integrating this traditional art form into educational practices. Conducted in primary schools in Xi’an, the study utilized a qualitative approach involving classroom observations, semi-structured interviews with educators, and focus group discussions with students. Key informants included scholars, performers, and students engaged in preserving Xi’an Drum Music. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, identifying themes related to literacy engagement, cultural awareness, and pedagogical challenges. Findings reveal that the rhythmic and lyrical elements of Xi’an Drum Music significantly improve literacy skills, such as phonemic awareness and reading comprehension while fostering cultural pride and identity among learners. However, resource constraints and limited teacher training hinder broader implementation. The study suggests developing standardized teaching materials, providing professional development for educators, and fostering collaborations between schools and cultural institutions. These measures can enhance the integration of traditional arts into modern education, ensuring cultural preservation and educational innovation.",2025.0,2025-02-01,0,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00719a5af7e3deab9a43148f06ed70aebee4a251

10.11113/mjfas.v20n1.3196,Superior Performances of Q-Switched and Mode-Locked Erbium-doped Fiber Laser using Black Titanium Dioxide Thin-film Saturable Absorbers,"This work reports on the improved Q-switched and mode-locked performances of black titanium dioxide (BTiO2-x) nanoparticles embedded in thin-film composite material as a saturable absorber compared to TiO2 in an erbium-doped fiber laser. The thin-film saturable absorbers were prepared by mixing the nanoparticles with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a host. BTiO2-x has a better nonlinear absorption coefficient, β of -12.46 x 10-7 m/W compared to -7.15x 10-7 m/W for TIO2 determined using z-scan measurement. The laser performance was evaluated in the 85.21 mW – 126.48 mW pump power range. Upon inserting TiO2 and BTiO2-x SA in a laser cavity, the peaks of the output spectrum shifted from 1566.62 nm to 1563.24 nm and 1565.75 nm, respectively. Regarding Q-switched performances, BTiO2-x SA generates a shorter pulse width of 16.00 µs than TiO2 SA. The slope efficiency of the TiO2 SA was 11.72 %, which is higher than the slope efficiency of the BTiO2-x SA. The maximum average and peak power generated by the BTiO2-x SA were 55.67 % and 54.83 % higher than the TiO2 SA. As for mode-locked outputs, BTiO2-x SA can generate pulsed laser at a low threshold power of 62.29 mW compared to TiO2 SA. Furthermore, BTiO2-x SA produced a shorter pulse width of 5.04 ps, whereas TiO2 is 9.20 ps. This study demonstrates that BTiO2-x SA has the potential to produce ultrashort pulse width using the mode-locked technique.",2024.0,2024-02-08,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0000a9d267466c9fa64ec568ffbbe77a11b97d56

10.1126/sciadv.ads0217,Biodegradable origami enables closed-loop sustainable robotic systems,"Robots are increasingly integral across various sectors due to their efficiency and superior capabilities, which enable performance beyond human potential. However, the development of robotic systems often conflicts with the sustainable development goals set by the United Nations, as they generate considerable nondegradable waste and organic/inorganic pollutants throughout their life cycle. In this paper, we introduce a dual closed-loop robotic system that integrates biodegradable, sustainable materials such as plasticized cellulose films and NaCl-infused ionic conductive gelatin organogels. These materials undergo a closed-loop ecological cycle from processing to biodegradation, contributing to new growth, while the self-sensing, origami-based robot supports a seamless human-in-the-loop teleoperation system. This innovative approach represents a paradigm shift in the application of soft robotic systems, offering a path toward a more sustainable future by aligning advanced robotic functionalities with environmental stewardship.",2025.0,2025-02-07,1,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001c05253caecbfc1b0d6225802b85fb20101a3

The NRs are formed on a planar channel of the TFT by hydrothermal synthesis for the mediators of pressure amplification. The fabricated devices show enhanced sensitivity by 16~20 times better than that of the thin film structure because NRs have a small pressure transmission area and causes more strain in the underlayered piezoelectric channel material. When making a sensor with a three-terminal structure, the leakage current in stand-by mode and optimal conductance state for pressure sensor is expected to be controlled by the gate voltage. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to identify the nanorods grown by hydrothermal synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to compare ZnO crystallinity according to device structure and process conditions. To investigate the effect of NRs, channel mobility is also extracted experimentally and the lateral flow of current density is analyzed with simulation (COMSOL) showing that when the piezopotential due to polarization is formed vertically in the channel, the effective mobility is degraded.",2022.0,2022-11-01,3,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0002416574cc991186e4310b6d4ff63d8aa3797f

The size of the Au core and the thickness of the silica shell can be easily controlled by simply adjusting the volume of HAuCl4 and TEOS, respectively, which can hardly be achieved by other approaches. The as-prepared Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs exhibited shell-thickness-dependent fluorescent properties. The optimum fluorescence enhancement of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was found to occur at a silica shell thickness of 34 nm with an enhancement factor of 5.0.

10.1039/d2nr07140a,MgO nanocube hydroxylation by nanometric water films.,"Hydrophilic nanosized minerals exposed to air moisture host thin water films that are key drivers of reactions of interest in nature and technology. Water films can trigger irreversible mineralogical transformations, and control chemical fluxes across networks of aggregated nanomaterials. Using X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and (micro)gravimetry, we tracked water film-driven transformations of periclase (MgO) nanocubes to brucite (Mg(OH)2) nanosheets. We show that three monolayer-thick water films first triggered the nucleation-limited growth of brucite, and that water film loadings continuously increased as newly-formed brucite nanosheets captured air moisture. Small (8 nm-wide) nanocubes were completely converted to brucite under this regime while growth on larger (32 nm-wide) nanocubes transitioned to a diffusion-limited regime when (∼0.9 nm-thick) brucite nanocoatings began hampering the flux of reactive species. We also show that intra- and inter-particle microporosity hosted a hydration network that sustained GPa-level crystallization pressures, compressing interlayer brucite spacing during growth. This was prevalent in aggregated 8 nm wide nanocubes, which formed a maze-like network of slit-shaped pores. By resolving the impact of nanocube size and microporosity on reaction yields and crystallization pressures, this work provides new insight into the study of mineralogical transformations induced by nanometric water films. Our findings can be applied to structurally related minerals important to nature and technology, as well as to advance ideas on crystal growth under nanoconfinement.",2023.0,2023-05-16,4,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0003d60f7468d727709556e9c86c598190d3231e

10.3366/film.2023.0246,"The Monstrous Mark of Cinema: Mulholland Drive, Spherology, and the “Virtual Space” of Filmic Fiction","This article interprets David Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001) to argue for the morphological influence cinematic images have on modernity's monstrous identity. It shows how Lynch's tactic of interweaving apparently discrete spaces of dream and reality – one often inverting or uncannily ironising the other – relies on the virtual space of cinema, which leaves a mark on understanding, irrespective of its apparent truth. To do so, I employ Peter Sloterdijk's philosophy of space – especially the spherology developed in his Spheres trilogy – and Bernard Stiegler's approach to cinematic phenomenology to consider the transferential force of cinema, and its power to cultivate and shape popular consciousness. Mulholland Drive is acutely aware of this force, and its interplay with the expectations and disappointments of Hollywood monstrosity inserts itself into the sphere-forming traffic of modern meaning-making. In doing so, I argue, the film takes up Lynch's familiar approach to irony and the weird to unwind the destructive uniformity of Hollywood hegemony. The productive bifurcations that result, inscribed in between cinema and consciousness, and forgettable as the very spheric intimacy of memory, gesture to what might live beyond discrete forms.",2023.0,2023-10-01,0,21,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004d22994cbbde82cd45ad0899d6fc4a710f298

10.1063/5.0039195,Angle-independent plasmonic substrates for multi-mode vibrational strong coupling with molecular thin films.,"Vibrational strong coupling of molecules to optical cavities based on plasmonic resonances has been explored recently because plasmonic near-fields can provide strong coupling in sub-diffraction limited volumes. Such field localization maximizes coupling strength, which is crucial for modifying the vibrational response of molecules and, thereby, manipulating chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate an angle-independent plasmonic nanodisk substrate that overcomes limitations of traditional Fabry-Pérot optical cavities because the design can strongly couple with all molecules on the surface of the substrate regardless of molecular orientation. We demonstrate that the plasmonic substrate provides strong coupling with the C=O vibrational stretch of deposited films of PMMA. We also show that the large linewidths of the plasmon resonance allow for simultaneous strong coupling to two, orthogonal water symmetric and asymmetric vibrational modes in a thin film of copper sulfate monohydrate deposited on the substrate surface. A three-coupled-oscillator model is developed to analyze the coupling strength of the plasmon resonance with these two water modes. With precise control over the nanodisk diameter, the plasmon resonance is tuned systematically through the modes, with the Rabi splitting from both modes varying as a function of the plasmon frequency and with strong coupling to both modes achieved simultaneously for a range of diameters. This work may aid further studies into manipulation of the ground-state chemical landscape of molecules by perturbing multiple vibrational modes simultaneously and increasing the coupling strength in sub-diffraction limited volumes.",2020.0,2020-12-01,24,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00054b4f8c52dccdbdc1b8221fd19df4d07b8826

10.1002/advs.202202028,Constructing Soft Perovskite–Substrate Interfaces for Dynamic Modulation of Perovskite Film in Inverted Solar Cells with Over 6200 Hours Photostability,"High‐performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) depend heavily on the quality of perovskite films, which is closely related to the lattice distortion, perovskite crystallization, and interfacial defects when being spin‐coated and annealed on the substrate surface. Here, a dynamic strategy to modulate the perovskite film formation by using a soft perovskite–substrate interface constructed by employing amphiphilic soft molecules (ASMs) with long alkyl chains and Lewis base groups is proposed. The hydrophobic alkyl chains of ASMs interacted with poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) greatly improve the wettability of PTAA to facilitate the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals, while the Lewis base groups bound to perovskite lattices significantly passivate the defects in situ. More importantly, this soft perovskite–substrate interface with ASMs between PTAA and perovskite film can dynamically match the lattice distortion with reduced interfacial residual strain upon perovskite crystallization and thermal annealing owing to the soft self‐adaptive long‐chains, leading to high‐quality perovskite films. Thus, the inverted PSCs show a power conversion efficiency approaching 20% with good reproducibility and negligible hysteresis. More impressively, the unencapsulated device exhibits state‐of‐the‐art photostability, retaining 84% of its initial efficiency under continuous simulated 1‐sun illumination for more than 6200 h at elevated temperature (≈65 °C).",2022.0,2022-08-17,21,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0006ced2d30ccc460fa6d30ebe6c2c3768c6b264

10.1021/acsnano.0c04793,Nanocube Imprint Lithography,"In recent years, imprint lithography has emerged as a promising patterning technique capable of high-speed and volume production. In this work, we report highly reproducible one-step printing of metal nanocubes. A dried film of monocrystalline silver cubes serves as the resist, and a soft polydimethylsiloxane stamp directly imprints the final pattern. The use of atomically smooth and sharp faceted nanocubes facilitates the printing of high-resolution and well-defined patterns with face-to-face alignment between adjacent cubes. It also permits digital control over the line width of patterns such as straight lines, curves, and complex junctions over an area of several square millimeters. Single-particle lattices as well as three-dimensional nanopatterns are also demonstrated with an aspect ratio up to 5 in the vertical direction. The high-fidelity nanocube patterning combined with the previously demonstrated epitaxial overgrowth can enable curved (single) crystals from solution at room temperature or highly efficient transparent conductors.",2020.0,2020-08-03,28,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00072fd1e807c09b265792651557421dffa7c24e

The present work aims to modify the composite coating layer properties by using two different types of bioactive reinforcing materials (biotin and hydroxyapatite) particles in different percentages (5% and 10%). Coatings were applied onto commercially pure Ti, SS 316 L, and SS 304 substrates by the dip-coating method. Characterization of samples includes microstructure observation by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), contact angle measurement (wettability), and MTT. The results show the addition of metallic particles (bioparticles) (hydroxyapatite particles, biotin) at 5 Vol. % improved the whole properties of composite materials. Using different particles' scale size aids to enhance the combinations in the alginate matrix producing a dual effect on composite film properties. In addition, the inclusion of metallic particles has to increase the wettability by reducing the contact angle. At the same time, MTT graphs revealed that after 3 days of exposure in MG-63 cells, 316 L SS alloys' surface following pack adhesion became more active.",2022.0,2022-09-26,11,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0007379b4c8974f356ad857b2adb7dad255be257

10.3390/lubricants9110106,Understanding Friction in Cam–Tappet Contacts—An Application-Oriented Time-Dependent Simulation Approach Considering Surface Asperities and Edge Effects,"With the increasing challenges of climate change and scarce resources, the development of sustainable and energy-efficient technical systems is becoming increasingly important. In many applications, the friction losses occurring in contacts have a decisive influence on the overall efficiency. At this point, tribological contact optimization can make an important contribution to increasing the efficiency of technical systems. However, improvements are often associated with a considerable experimental effort. To reduce the development time, additional simulation models can be applied to predict the tribological behavior. This requires the closest possible approximation of the real contact within a numerical model. This paper presents a simulation approach for the time-dependent simulation of a cam–tappet contact. The simulation uses realistic operating conditions as they arise in the valve train of internal combustion engines. The influence of edge effects on the friction behavior is considered by a scaled calculation area and the influence of the surface roughness is investigated using stochastic asperity models. It is shown that the tribological behavior within the contact strongly depends on the surface properties and the load spectrum used. In addition, edge effects on the sides of the contact area have a clear influence on the pressure and film thickness distribution.",2021.0,2021-10-26,10,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0008304a7664c38c35605196676e86e020de020d

10.1111/iej.13102,Factors affecting the chemical efficacy of 2% sodium hypochlorite against oral steady‐state dual‐species biofilms: Exposure time and volume application,"Abstract Aim To study the influence of time and volume of 2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) on biofilm removal and to investigate the changes induced on the biofilm architecture. Steady‐state, dual‐species biofilms of standardized thickness and a realistic contact surface area between biofilms and NaOCl were used. Methodology Streptococcus oralis J22 and Actinomyces naeslundii T14V‐J1 biofilms were grown on saliva‐coated hydroxyapatite discs within sample holders in the Constant Depth Film Fermenter (CDFF) for 96 h. Two per cent NaOCl was statically applied for three different time intervals (60, 120 and 300 s) and in two different volumes (20 and 40 μL) over the biofilm samples. The diffusion‐driven effects of time and volume on biofilm disruption and dissolution were assessed with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Structural changes of the biofilms treated with 2% NaOCl were studied with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Low Load Compression Testing (LLCT). A two‐way analysis of variance (2‐way anova) was performed, enabling the effect of each independent variable as well as their interaction on the outcome measures. Results Optical coherence tomography revealed that by increasing the exposure time and volume of 2% NaOCl, both biofilm disruption and dissolution significantly increased. Analysis of the interaction between the two independent variables revealed that by increasing the volume of 2% NaOCl, significant biofilm dissolution could be achieved in less time. Examination of the architecture of the remaining biofilms corroborated the EPS‐lytic action of 2% NaOCl, especially when greater volumes were applied. The viscoelastic analysis of the 2% NaOCl‐treated biofilms revealed that the preceding application of higher volumes could impact their subsequent removal. Conclusions Time and volume of 2% NaOCl application should be taken into account for maximizing the anti‐biofilm efficiency of the irrigant and devising targeted disinfecting regimes against remaining biofilms.",2019.0,2019-03-13,25,69,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b857fda8d35427c1771d0a253e162351457e7

10.1117/1.OE.62.3.035102,Improving transmittance of long-wave infrared guided-mode resonant filters,"Abstract. The long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectral region spanning from 8 to 12  μm is useful for many scientific and industrial applications. Many of these applications require use of either a bandpass or a bandstop filter that can be realized by the guided-mode resonance (GMR) effect with subwavelength periodic features in layered dielectric materials transparent in the LWIR. The GMR filters operating in the LWIR region are fabricated by depositing an amorphous germanium (Ge) film to form a zero-contrast (ZC) waveguide-grating (WGG) on a polished zinc selenide (ZnSe) substrate. In general, the backside of a ZnSe substrate with refractive index 2.41 is uncoated causing a 17% Fresnel-reflection loss in the light transmitted through the filter due to a large impedance mismatch at the ZnSe/air interface. Because we use such filters in the LWIR laser experiments for notch filtering, to improve the filter transmittance we used ZnSe substrates coated on one-side with broadband antireflection coating (ARC) covering the 7 to 12  μm spectral range to fabricate GMRFs with one-dimensional (1D) Ge ZC WGG. We employed high-spatial resolution e-beam lithography and reactive-ion etching nanofabrication techniques to achieve high-performance large-area (12  ×  12  mm2) 1D notch filters with subwavelength periods. We characterized polarization dependent spectral performance of the prototype filters with both coherent and incoherent incident light using a tunable quantum cascade laser system that spans the 7 to 12  μm region, and a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with collimated incident beam to achieve close to 15% improvement in the peak transmittance as well as significant reduction in coherent noise compared to our earlier results with GMRFs without ARC. Here, we present the filter design simulation and measurement results.",2023.0,2023-03-01,0,20,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000dd6ef388acf4d55011c1817f7c937d9d430a4

Proliposome formulations were characterized for vesicle size, vesicle size distribution, vesicle morphology, drug content, entrapment efficiency, percentage yield value, storage stability analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), in vitro diffusion study, release kinetic studies, and antifungal activity. Topical proliposomal gels were prepared by incorporation of lyophilized proliposome into a structured vehicle carbopol 934 (2.5%).Results: A spherical shape of reconstituted FLZ liposome with an average vesicle about 5–8 μm was observed in photomicrographs. The percentage entrapment of drug was increased with increase in phospholipid composition in the range of 55.13–69.61%. The FTIR and DSC studies showed no possible drug-excipient interaction. Proliposomal gel showed the prolonged release of FLZ than the lyophilized liposomes. The release kinetic values of regression coefficients confirmed the diffusion-dependent release of the drug. Stability studies indicated that product is stable and should be stored at low temperature.Conclusion: The proposed FLZ proliposomal gel showed sustained release with enhanced antifungal activity implicating its potential in effective transdermal delivery for the topical pharmacotherapy.",2018.0,2018-08-07,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000df9987c67753d89346cf759c26b43a7413f05

10.3390/nano12060940,Freestanding Translucent ZnO–Cellulose Nanocomposite Films for Ultraviolet Sensor Applications,"The rapidly advancing technology of wearable and miniaturized electronics has increased the demand for low-cost high-performance flexible sensors. Herein, the preparation of translucent freestanding films consisting of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) via a simple spray coating method is presented. The obtained nanocomposite films were thin (~10 µm) and flexible. The scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analysis revealed that the nanocomposite film was composed of regions of ZnO NP-modified CNFs and regions of aggregation of ZnO NPs with each other. The electrical conductance of the films was rapidly increased beyond 40 wt.% ZnO and reached up to >50 nA at 60 wt.% ZnO. This was attributed to the increased number of conductive paths formed by the ZnO NPs in the nanocomposite film when a certain threshold was crossed. The ZnO–CNF nanocomposite film exhibited a stable response over on/off cycles of UV light exposure. The responsivity and sensitivity of the nanocomposite film with 60 wt.% ZnO were 36.5 mA/W and 247, respectively. Even when the device was curved (radius of curvature: 3 mm), the response and sensitivity remained high. The developed nanocomposite films are expected to be applied as environmentally friendly flexible UV sensors.",2022.0,2022-03-01,9,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f0e4f49a2f11a28c23f7b33e89979472bd641

10.17721/2308-135x.2019.52.10-16,HOTEL FOR PHOTOTOURISTS - A MODERN TREND IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY,"Purpose. To consider the concept of “phototourism”, to find out its essence and difference from other special types of tourism, to characterize its classification features. To reveal the prerequisites for its development in Ukraine to increase the tourist attractiveness of the country.

Methods. For research, methods such as system-structural, abstract-logical, analysis, synthesis, generalization, observation, comparison were used; classification and literary methods. The system-structural method was used to assess the possibility of the existence of domestic hotels that will be able to provide photo tourists with services such as renting specialized photo equipment, workshops on using cameras, organizing photo tours and others. Thanks to the abstract-logical method, the theoretical aspects of the development and functioning of phototourism in Ukraine were revealed. The comparison method was used to evaluate the pricing policy of digital and film cameras.

Results. The classification of photo tours and the specific features of phototourism, which distinguish it from other types of tourism, are given. The main trends in the development and popularization of phototourism in the world and Ukraine are investigated. Foreign photo tours and their specifics are analyzed. A survey was carried out among the population of Ukraine about their interest in hotel enterprises that can provide services for phototourists, organize tours and offer specialized photographic equipment for rent. A comparative assessment of the pricing policy of various types of photographic equipment is provided, which can be used in phototours organized by a hotel company specializing in phototourism. The innovative aspects of phototourism, which can be used in practice in the domestic hotel business, are analyzed. The given examples of such phototouristic regions as Cherkasy, Carpathian, Transcarpathian and Chernigov, which testify to the potential of Ukraine as a country that has the opportunity to expand its tourism market.

Scientific novelty. Scientific novelty lies in substantiating the feasibility of creating a hotel for phototourists in Ukraine, as a new way to popularize phototourism in the hotel industry of the country. Phototourism with the use of film cameras is the newest direction in the tourism sector not only in Ukraine, but throughout the world.

The aim of this study was to form a uniform layer of sodium alginate-based edible coating (1.25% sodium alginate, 2% glycerol, 0.2% sunflower oil, 1% span 80, 0.2% tween 80, (w/w)) and investigate the effects on the water barrier characteristics of fresh-cut cantaloupe and strawberries. To this end, a uniform and continuous edible film formation was achieved (0.187 ± 0.076 mm and 0.235 ± 0.077 mm for cantaloupe and strawberries, respectively) with an additional immersion step into a calcium solution at the very beginning of the coating process. The coating application was effective in significantly reducing the water loss (%) of the cantaloupe pieces. However, no significant effect was observed in water vapor resistance results and weight change measurements in a climate chamber (80%→60% relative humidity (RH) at 10 °C). External packaging conditions (i.e., closed, perforated, and open) were not significantly effective on water activity (aw) values of cantaloupe, but were effective for strawberry values. In general, the coating application promoted the water loss of strawberry samples. Additionally, the water vapor transmission rate of stand-alone films was determined (2131 g·100 µm/(m2·d·bar) under constant environmental conditions (23 °C, 100%→50% RH) due to the ability to also evaluate the efficacy in ideal conditions.",2019.0,2019-06-01,51,91,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0010371f5cc733fbc40b5465d48e44f9da53d05a

10.52783/jes.2645,Movie Scene Simulation and Rendering Based on Virtual Reality Technology,"Movie scene simulation and rendering with virtual reality (VR) technology have emerged as a game-changing method in the film industry, providing filmmakers with unparalleled creative opportunities and immersive storytelling experiences. This article investigates the use of VR technology in movie scene simulation and rendering, with a focus on sophisticated modelling techniques and rendering methods. Filmmakers can effectively control scene complexity and enhance rendering speed by utilizing VR-based modelling approaches such as multi-resolution decomposition and level of detail (LOD) rendering. These modelling techniques enable the development of highly complex and realistic virtual worlds, allowing filmmakers to bring their creative visions to life with unparalleled precision. In addition, VR-based rendering technologies, such as viewpoint-based geometric chunking rendering, improve frame rates and overall scene rendering quality, resulting in a seamless and immersive watching experience for audiences. Using VR technology, filmmakers can push the boundaries of traditional filmmaking, create fascinating cinematic experiences, and reimagine narrative in the digital age. This research explores the revolutionary impact of VR technology on movie scene simulation and rendering, emphasizing its potential to change the way films are created, seen, and appreciated by audiences throughout the world. Finally, they compare and assess the scene effect, LOD detail level, and interactive experience effect before and after simplification. scene design for virtual reality technologies generally scores 5-6 on each of the measures, whereas common technology's scenario design usually gets 3 to 4, showing whether the scenario design of virtual reality technology works properly.",2024.0,2024-04-29,0,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00107c8b38f1d0a406d7e1d26251992a7902ba26

Thereby, the aim of this work was to enlarge the knowledge for preparing sensitive elements for TNT with the aid of molecular imprinting; a known technique used to deliver biomimetic materials. The study first depicts the auto-assembly mechanism of (TNT) with functional diamino-silanes (i.e., N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyl methyl dimethoxysilane), via “double” Meisenheimer complexes. This mechanism is being described herein for the first time and applied further to obtain molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) films for TNT recognition. For testing the potential application of films as chemical sensor elements, typical rebinding assays of TNT in a liquid state and the rebinding of TNT in a vapor state, using multilayered sensor chips composed of quartz-chromium (Cr)-gold (Au)-titanium oxide (TiO2), were employed. Batch rebinding experiments have shown that thinner films were more efficient on retaining TNT molecules in the first five min, with a specificity of about 1.90. The quartz-Cr-Au-TiO2-MIP capacitive sensors, tested in vapor state, registered short response times (less than 25 s), low sensitivity to humidity and high specificity for TNT.",2020.0,2020-03-15,7,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0012f83c3edcc67254feb7b028df158b65195d0d

10.1098/rstb.2022.0426,Perceptual oddities: assessing the relationship between film editing and prediction processes,"During film viewing, humans parse sequences of individual shots into larger narrative structures, often weaving transitions at edit points into an apparently seamless and continuous flow. Editing helps filmmakers manipulate visual transitions to induce feelings of fluency/disfluency, tension/relief, curiosity, expectation and several emotional responses. We propose that the perceptual dynamics induced by film editing can be captured by a predictive processing (PP) framework. We hypothesise that visual discontinuities at edit points produce discrepancies between anticipated and actual sensory input, leading to prediction error. Further, we propose that the magnitude of prediction error depends on the predictability of each shot within the narrative flow, and lay out an account based on conflict monitoring. We test this hypothesis in two empirical studies measuring electroencephalography (EEG) during passive viewing of film excerpts, as well as behavioural responses during an active edit detection task. We report the neural and behavioural modulations at editing boundaries across three levels of narrative depth, showing greater modulations for edits spanning less predictable, deeper narrative transitions. Overall, our contribution lays the groundwork for understanding film editing from a PP perspective.

10.1021/JP076036W,Protecting peroxidase activity of multilayer enzyme-polyion films using outer catalase layers.,"Films constructed layer-by-layer on electrodes with architecture {protein/hyaluronic acid (HA)}n containing myoglobin (Mb) or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were protected against protein damage by H2O2 by using outer catalase layers. Peroxidase activity for substrate oxidation requires activation by H2O2, but {protein/HA}n films without outer catalase layers are damaged slowly and irreversibly by H2O2. The rate and extent of damage were decreased dramatically by adding outer catalase layers to decompose H2O2. Comparative studies suggest that protection results from catalase decomposing a fraction of the H2O2 as it enters the film, rather than by an in-film diffusion barrier. The outer catalase layers controlled the rate of H2O2 entry into inner regions of the film, and they biased the system to favor electrocatalytic peroxide reduction over enzyme damage. Catalase-protected {protein/HA}n films had an increased linear concentration range for H2O2 detection. This approach offers an effective way to protect biosensors from damage by H2O2.",2007.0,2007-12-27,22,19,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d2615e82b2c157521eeb573bfedadfd7c62a7
10.1063/5.0230882,Non-local optical response of a multi-phased quantum material,"Light–matter interaction in quantum materials presents a new paradigm as light can tip the balance between many competing quantum many-body phases to result in new phenomena. Describing the optical response of such materials requires complex models. Here, we develop a non-local model to describe the optical response of a quantum material, 1T-TaS2. 1T-TaS2 is a charge density wave material that supports competing stacking configurations of its charge domains. The presence of various stacking domains results in an inhomogeneity that necessitates a non-local dielectric function. We experimentally measure the non-local optical response of 1T-TaS2 films under various illumination intensities and validate our model. The non-local parameter extracted from our measurements sheds light on the competition between the two stacking configurations of 1T-TaS2. Our technique of measuring non-local optical response serves as a quick, simple, and non-invasive method to probe the energy landscape of strong correlations in many such quantum materials.",2024.0,2024-05-25,0,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d2f109fb82cdce4caaa0064f11615a8a1880a

10.1002/jbm.b.33905,Modulation of surface stiffness and cell patterning on polymer films using micropatterns.,"Here, a new technology was developed to selectively produce areas of high and low surface Young's modulus on biomedical polymer films using micropatterns. First, an elastic polymer film was adhered to a striped micropattern to fabricate a micropattern-supported film. Next, the topography and Young's modulus of the film surface were mapped using atomic force microscopy. Contrasts between the concave and convex locations of the stripe pattern were obvious in the Young's modulus map, although the topographical map of the film surface appeared almost flat. The concave and convex locations of a polymer film supported by a different micropattern also contrasted clearly. The resulting Young's modulus map showed that the Young's modulus was higher at convex locations than at concave locations. Hence, regions of high and low stiffness can be locally generated based on the shape of the micropattern supporting the film. When cells were cultured on the micropattern-supported films, NIH3T3 fibroblasts preferentially accumulated in convex regions with high Young's moduli. These findings demonstrate that this new technology can regulate regions of high and low surface Young's modulus on a cellular scaffold with high planar resolution, as well as providing a method for directing cellular patterning. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, isothermal gas chromatographic (GC) retention times of 60 neutral PFAS were measured using four columns with different stationary phase polarities, which indicated varying polar interactions exerted by these substances. The GC data were combined with new octanol/water partition coefficient data from this study and existing partition coefficient data from the literature and used to determine the polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) solute descriptors. A complete set of the solute descriptors was obtained for 47 PFAS, demonstrating the characteristic intermolecular interaction properties, such as hydrogen bonding capabilities influenced by the electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl group. The partition coefficients between octanol and water, air and water, and octanol and air predicted by the PP-LFER models agreed with those predicted by the quantum chemically based model COSMOtherm, suggesting that both models are highly accurate for neutral PFAS and can fill the current large data gaps in partition property data. A chemical partitioning space plot was generated by using the PP-LFER-predicted partition coefficients, showing the primary importance of the air phase for the environmental distribution of nonpolar and weakly polar PFAS and the increasing significance of organic phases with increasing PFAS polarity.",2023.0,2023-11-01,13,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00000a919f96e27214c974f39c97c26a46c41a26

10.3390/rs14122755,Remote Sensing of Complex Permittivity and Penetration Depth of Soils Using P-Band SAR Polarimetry,"A P-band SAR moisture estimation method is introduced for complex soil permittivity and penetration depth estimation using fully polarimetric P-band SAR signals. This method combines eigen- and model-based decomposition techniques for separation of the total backscattering signal into three scattering components (soil, dihedral, and volume). The incorporation of a soil scattering model allows for the first time the estimation of complex soil permittivity and permittivity-based penetration depth. The proposed method needs no prior assumptions on land cover characteristics and is applicable to a variety of vegetation types. The technique is demonstrated for airborne P-band SAR measurements acquired during the AirMOSS campaign (2012–2015). The estimated complex permittivity agrees well with climate and soil conditions at different monitoring sites. Based on frequency and permittivity, P-band penetration depths vary from 5 cm to 35 cm. This value range is in accordance with previous studies in the literature. Comparison of the results is challenging due to the sparsity of vertical soil in situ sampling. It was found that the disagreement between in situ measurements and SAR-based estimates originates from the discrepancy between the in situ measuring depth of the top-soil layer (0–5 cm) and the median penetration depth of the P-band waves (24.5–27 cm).",2022.0,2022-06-08,9,81,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000070aec711fdf8f4949101a5d7e9bac64f9a48

10.1177/2473011421s00184,Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMIS) of Primary Total Ankle Arthroplasty in Patients Under 50 Years of Age,"Category: Ankle; Ankle Arthritis Introduction/Purpose: Compared to more prevalent arthritic conditions, ankle arthritis is complicated by an earlier age of onset. With advancements in 4th generation primary and revision componentry, total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is considered an option for end-stage ankle arthritis in younger patients aligning with paradigm shifts in knee arthroplasty. Recently published data demonstrates excellent survivorship and complication rates in short/mid-term follow-up of younger patients who received a primary TAA. Additionally, older TAA patients display comparable PROMIS relative to hip/knee arthroplasty. However, there remains a paucity of literature surrounding the PROMIS of younger patients undergoing TAA. Thus, our aim was to assess PROMIS of individuals less than 50 years of age receiving a primary total ankle arthroplasty Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients < 50 years who received a primary total ankle replacement at a single academic institution between 2003 and 2019 was conducted. Patient demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome characteristics were recorded from a chart review of 41 patients with at least one year of post-surgical follow-up (Table 1). Post- operative PROMIS scores were obtained via telephone interviews. Primary outcomes that were measured included emotional and physical health, activity limitation, ambulation, and global health. SF-36, PROMIS Global Health, and Sickness Impact Profile Ambulation were used. Functional outcomes in our study sample were compared with age and gender-matched norms from a general US population, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each functional outcome mean. Student t-test was used for continuous variables, and chi-square analysis was used for categorical variables. Results: Thirty-one of 41 eligible patients were interviewed. The average age at surgery was 40 years old. Clinical and radiographic follow-up was a mean of 59.7 months and 31.2 months following TAA, respectively. General health as measured with the SF-36 was not significantly different from age/gender-matched norms. Eighty-seven percent of patients would choose to have a TAR again. While 58% reported being limited in vigorous activities, 61% were able to ambulate frequently for long periods of time. On average the patients did not report ongoing pain, and only 16% reported fatigue that hindered activities. Eighty-one percent reported returning to full employment and performing their duties without difficulty, and 84% reported they resumed all normal social activities. Primary implant survivorship was 88%. Conclusion: Despite a younger age and potentially increased demands, patients younger than 50 years of age undergoing primary total ankle arthroplasty are generally very satisfied with their index procedure at a mean follow-up of nearly 5 years. Our findings of positive outcomes on their health and well-being may improve surgeon insight for TAA as a preferred treatment for younger individuals with end-stage ankle arthritis.",2022.0,2022-01-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00007a32b17ce7ac479c6aec38ee25841dd53c4b
10.1515/ling-2023-0126,"What a nominal predicate may mean: eel, merfolk, and other creatures","
 A nominal predicate construction (NPC; e.g. “Cicero is {Tully/an orator}”) typically indicates the relation of identity or inclusion. NPCs, however, may receive marked interpretations as well, as in “I’m the ham sandwich” and “Their car is a peculiar color”; the former does not entail that the speaker is identical to the sandwich, and the latter does not entail that the car belongs to a set of colors. This article identifies, classifies, and analyzes such marked NPCs in English and Japanese, thereby enriching the taxonomy of NPCs acknowledged in the existing literature. It will be argued that both Japanese and English NPCs may indicate either (i) one of a handful of relatively specific semantic relations including the one of identity/inclusion, or (ii) an unspecified relation that is to be contextually inferred. The English NPC is semantically less flexible than the Japanese one, being compatible with a narrower range of specific semantic relations and allowing the unspecified-relation interpretation less leniently. The English NPC, on the other hand, is more liberally used in comparison to its counterparts in some related languages (e.g. German). The analysis put forth makes a good vantage point for general-linguistic and typological inquiries as to how languages in general may contrast with each other in terms of what types of situations can be described with a NPC.",2024.0,2024-10-01,0,13,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00009f9652a949c973ba8224e2a47a35c2d77de2
10.3389/fpsyg.2021.717352,Deconstructing the Native Speaker: Further Evidence From Heritage Speakers for Why This Horse Should Be Dead!,"The category “native speaker” is flawed because it fails to consider the diversity between the speaker groups falling under its scope, as highlighted in previous literature. This paper provides further evidence by focusing on the similarities and differences between heritage speakers (HSs) and monolingually-raised speakers (MSs) of their heritage and majority languages. HSs are bilinguals who acquire a family (heritage) language and a societal (majority) language in early childhood. Naturalistic exposure from early childhood qualifies them as native speakers of their heritage language. Some HSs are simultaneous bilinguals, which makes them native speakers of their majority language as well. Others are early second language acquirers who may be indistinguishable from simultaneous bilinguals. Previous research shows that the heritage language productions of German HSs in the United States do not completely overlap with those of German MSs, who are, by default, native speakers. In overall clause type selection (independent main, coordinate main, and subordinate), the HSs differ from German MSs in German but are similar to English MSs in English. The present study examines the distribution of finite subordinate clauses and their types (relative, complement, and adverbial) across registers in 27 adolescent HSs of German in the United States, compared to 32 adolescent MSs of German and 32 MSs of English. All participants described a short video in two settings (formal/informal) and two modes (spoken/written). Results demonstrate that, even with respect to a specific phenomenon (subordinate clauses), HSs show similarities and differences to MSs of both languages. Concerning the distribution of subordinate clause types, HSs behave similarly to both English and German MSs. Concerning subordinate clauses in general, HSs use them less frequently than MSs in German. In English, the difference is more nuanced: HSs differentiate between settings in both modes, while MSs do so only in the written mode. This indicates that the category “native speaker” is not a meaningful descriptor since it covers speakers with varying production patterns. We propose that studies including native speakers should assure transparency and replicability of research by specifying and taking into account speaker characteristics such as bilingualism, proficiency, exposure and dominance.",2021.0,2021-10-05,9,78,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0000b22baad8274ab83aa82668b758579c0a63f2

10.5334/IJIC.S3227,"The patients’ perspective: what causes hospitalizations for ambulatory
 care sensitive conditions?","Introduction: In Portugal, the hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSH) account for 12% of all hospitalizations with an estimated financial impact of up to 450 million€. Therefore, understanding the determinants of avoidable hospitalizations is important to develop policies and interventions that reduce the ACSH. Analyzing the patient’s perspective brings an angle relevant to explain the ACSH. Despite patients are the most qualified to express the social and individual context of their experience, few studies have investigated the patients’ perspective about what causes ACSH. The aim of this study is to compare the perspective of patients on the determinants of the ACSH. Methods: A literature review was performed to map the determinants of the ACSH, by adapting the work of Sentell et al. (2016).  The map takes into account 8 domains, namely healthcare access, disease self-management, individual characteristics, environmental characteristics, health status, lifestyle, health literacy and social support. Each domain gathers a set of determinants of the ACSH. This framework was used to analyze the patients’ perspective through the point of view of the individual patient and the patient’s association representatives. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to the representatives (n=6) and to the patients with an ACSH at the Internal Medicine Wards of Central Lisbon University Hospital Center (n=22). The content of the interviews was coded according to the previously mentioned map. Results: Determinants regarding the causes of the ASCH were mentioned differently according to the two perspectives. On the patient’s interviews, the domain health status (determinant: multiple chronic diseases) was mention on 18% of the interviews and the domains disease self-management (determinant: incapacity to self-manage disease) and access to healthcare (determinant: poor coordination across levels of care) were mention on 10% of the interviews. The domain access to healthcare (determinants: poor coordination across levels of care, inadequacy of healthcare services and relation between patient and health professional) was mention on 28% of the representative’s interviews. Discussion: Different determinants are emphasized when considered patient’s or patient’s representatives perspectives, both relate to complexity and fragmentation of the health care system. Each chronic disease demands a growing number of interventions, providers and settings of care multiplied for each single disease results in serious difficulties for patients. In order to be effective, an integrated care solution needs to be drawn taking into account the patient background. Conclusions: On the analysis of the patient’s perspective, we found different information from the one we usually get on traditional databases. It also exposes the disagreement between the two patients’ perspectives which confirms the need to promote patient-centered care and integrated healthcare delivery in order to minimize the ACSH. Limitations: The ongoing study and the single setting of the interviews are recognized limitations of our analysis. Suggestions for future research: Based on this evidence, we will apply a patient survey to identify the most important determinants of the ACSH to a wider sample (approximately 200 individuals).

10.18697/ajfand.139.24960,Optimization of quality characteristics of acacia honey in Indonesia through different method system,"This study investigated the potential effects of implementing a water-jet vacuum cooling system on the quality attributes of honey throughout the postharvest handling stages. This study revealed that packaging honey while still hot poses a significant risk of compromising package integrity, thereby highlighting the importance of proper cooling protocols. Integral to the investigation were multiple quality parameters utilized to assess the impact of the water-jet vacuum cooling system on honey. These parameters encompassed essential aspects such as water volume, viscosity, pH, acidity, density, total dissolved solids, enzyme activity and reducing sugar content. A pivotal aspect of the experimental setup involved the initiation of pasteurization at 63°C, which served as the starting point for subsequent cooling processes. Subsequent cooling procedures were executed across a temperature gradient ranging from 63 to 35°C, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of the system. Analysis of the obtained results revealed promising insights into the potential benefits of the vacuum cooling procedure in mitigating the adverse effects stemming from the heating process, thereby preserving honey quality and structural integrity. The significance of these findings extends beyond the immediate scope of honey production and has implications for broader agricultural practices, food processing industries, and food safety. By offering a viable solution to enhance post-harvest handling practices, the integration of water-jet vacuum cooling systems optimizes efficiency, reduces resource consumption, and upholds product quality standards. The vacuum-cooling procedure can reduce the harm caused by the heating process to honey quality and bodily characteristics. The values for total dissolved solids, viscosity, and density were also consistent with those reported in the literature. The values for water content, diastase enzymes, reducing sugars, and acidity of honey were in accordance with those of the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) honey. Vacuum cooling produces honey of a higher grade and physical consistency than traditional cooling methods. However, further research is required to validate and optimize the proposed methodology to ensure its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and practical feasibility in real-world applications.

10.3389/fneur.2023.1161940,Case report: Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome: hearing impairment as the onset of an insidious disorder with high recurrence risk,"Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (MTS) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by TIMM8A loss of function. It is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in childhood, progressive optic atrophy in early adulthood, early onset dementia and psychiatric symptoms of variable expressivity. We present a family with 4 affected males, explore age-related and interfamilial variability and review the literature. Case report A 31 years-old male developed psychiatric symptoms at age 18 and presented early onset dementia. Sensorineural hearing loss had been diagnosed in childhood. At 28yo, he developed dysarthria, dysphonia, dysmetria, limb hyperreflexia, dystonia, and spasticity following an acute encephalopathic crisis. WES revealed a hemizygous novel likely pathogenic variant in TIMM8A, c.45_61dup p.(His21Argfs*11), establishing the diagnosis of MTS. Genetic counseling of the family allowed the diagnosis of three other symptomatic relatives −3 nephews (11yo and two 6yo twins), children of a carrier sister. The oldest nephew had been followed since 4yo due to speech delay. Sensorineural hearing loss was diagnosed at 9yo, and hearing aids were prescribed. The two other nephews were monozygotic twins, and both had unilateral strabismus. One of the twins had macrocephaly and hypoplasia of the anterior temporal lobe, as disclosed by an MRI performed due to febrile seizures. Both had developmental delays, with the language being the most affected area. Their audiograms confirmed hearing loss. All three nephews were hemizygous for the familial TIMM8A variant. Discussion Hearing loss, an early sign of MTS due to auditory neuropathy, can often be overlooked until more severe features of the disorder manifest. Recurrence risk is high for female carriers, and reproductive options should be offered. Early monitoring of hearing and vision loss and neurological impairment in MTS patients is mandatory since early interventions may positively impact their development. This family showcases the importance of performing a timely etiological investigation of hearing loss and its impact on genetic counseling.",2023.0,2023-06-01,1,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001bb4631bc29ca87d1048f12209057cad60953

10.3389/fspor.2024.1509784,Meeting international self-report muscle strengthening guidelines is associated with better cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity in adults,"Engaging in muscle strengthening activities (e.g., resistance training) at least twice/week is promoted by (Inter)national movement guidelines. Cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (cvBRS) reflects the ability to modulate R-R interval in response to changes in systolic blood pressure. Given the current conflicting literature, this study posed to explore the relationship between self-report muscle strengthening frequency and spontaneous cvBRS. 114 adults (62 females; age: 33 ± 19 years, 22% >55 years; body mass index: 24.2 ± 3.7 kg/m2) self-reported their weekly muscle strengthening activity frequencies via the Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire. Supine beat-by-beat R-R intervals [electrocardiography; 1.00 ± 0.18 s (0.90–1.50 s)] and systolic blood pressure [via finger photoplethysmography; 116 ± 11 mmHg (93–151 mmHg)] were recorded for 10.7 ± 2.0 min (5.3–14.5 min). Spontaneous cvBRS was assessed using the sequence technique. Data were analyzed using multiple regressions adjusted for age, sex, body mass index. Participants completed 2 ± 2 (0–7) days/week of muscle strengthening activities (56% met guidelines), and average overall cvBRS was 14.9 ± 9.1 (3.1–48.4) ms/mmHg. Higher reported frequencies were positively associated with overall cvBRS (Adjusted R2 = 0.40, p < 0.001; β = 2.24, p < 0.001). Meeting muscle strengthening activity guidelines was associated with improved overall cvBRS (Adjusted R2 = 0.29, p < 0.001; β = 7.68, p < 0.001). All results were unchanged if cvBRS for up-sequences or down-sequences only were used (all, p < 0.001). In conclusion, engaging in muscle strengthening exercises and particularly meeting existing guidelines were associated with better beat-by-beat vagally-mediated blood pressure regulation.",2024.0,2024-12-11,0,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d0df03f45f48b13c7fd8f292d4880fc41174
10.3389/fpls.2022.843004,Overview of Witloof Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) Discolorations and Their Underlying Physiological and Biochemical Causes,"Many fruits and vegetables suffer from unwanted discolorations that reduce product quality, leading to substantial losses along the supply chain. Witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum), a specialty crop characterized by its unique bitter taste and crunchiness, is particularly sensitive to various types of red and brown discolorations. The etiolated vegetable suffers from three predominant color disorders, i.e., core browning, internal leaf reddening, and leaf edge browning. Additionally, several less frequently observed color disorders such as hollow pith, external red, and point noir can also negatively affect crop quality. In this article, we bring together fragmented literature and present a comprehensive overview of the different discoloration types in chicory, and discuss their potential underlying physiological causes, including laticifer rupture, calcium deficiency, and a disturbed water distribution. We also describe the role of environmental cues that influence discoloration incidence, including cultivation and postharvest storage conditions such as forcing and storage temperature, root ripeness and the duration of the forcing process. Finally, we zoom in on the underlying biochemical pathways that govern color disorders in witloof chicory, with a strong emphasis on polyphenol oxidase.",2022.0,2022-02-23,3,80,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d5a7eead8c7653ba58044454b045ef1f6e0b

Elucidating the underlying cause is imperative to enable appropriate management. Vincristine-related neurotoxicity is a potentially reversible cause of BLVCP and is rarely described in the literature. We report a case of a 65-year-old man who presented with acutely worsening dyspnoea and stridor following his fifth cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy for hematological malignancy. His airway limitation was managed with supportive measures until he was able to compensate, at which point he was discharged home. His chemotherapy regimen was altered and he underwent serial examinations until he regained full vocal cord mobility at three months following his initial presentation.

Increasing post-capture survival of these species is very important to reducing the widespread impacts of bycatch, particularly on protected and threatened populations. In this paper, we review recent literature on safe handling of sea turtles, cetaceans, seabirds, sharks, and billfish and summarize the most effective measures for improving survivability of these species after interactions with gillnet, pelagic longline, and purse seine gear. We also review the current tuna Regional Fishery Management Organization (tRFMO) measures on safe handling and release to identify gaps in implementation of safe handling practices. Strategies that increase post-capture survival of marine species can be grouped into 3 primary categories: reducing immediate mortality, minimizing injury that results in delayed mortality, and reducing stress that can lead to death. Routine training of fishermen on safe handling practices greatly improves the effectiveness of these measures. When bycatch does occur, the strategies to increase post-release survival become key for protecting vulnerable marine populations. This inventory highlights the great conservation value that can be provided by the tRFMOs by providing guidance and training on safe handling practices to increase post-release survival across taxa.",2019.0,2019-03-14,29,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000231bcfb42203bc5c6fff055a1563c78eab6d0

To examine implications of such choices, an analysis was conducted to explore the extent to which disparate landscape models agree in their epidemiological and entomological risk predictions when extrapolated to new regions. Agreement between six literature-drawn landscape models was examined by comparing predicted county-level distributions of either Lyme disease or Ixodes scapularis vector using Spearman ranked correlation. AUC analyses and multinomial logistic regression were used to assess the ability of these extrapolated landscape models to predict observed national data. Three models based on measures of vegetation, habitat patch characteristics, and herbaceous landcover emerged as effective predictors of observed disease and vector distribution. An ensemble model containing these three models improved precision and predictive ability over individual models. A priori assessment of qualitative model characteristics effectively identified models that subsequently emerged as better predictors in quantitative analysis.

10.1163/25902539-03020007,"Reforming Schools: A Comparison of Chinese Urban vs. Rural School Principals’ Values, Views & Visions","
Principal as the key to school reform has been a frequently discussed topic in the research literature. However, few studies have investigated principals’ own values, views and visions and how these may affect reform in their schools. The study reported in this paper intends to fill this void. It is a joint effort by American and Chinese education scholars to explore and examine the profiles, preparation and perspectives of urban and rural principals in China, based on the conceptual framework and research methodology of the American national Study of the Education of Educators and the earlier comparative study of Chinese, American and Australian school principals. A comprehensive principal survey was administered to several hundred urban and rural school principals in China and interviews were conducted with selected principals. Our study findings reveal both similarities and differences in values, views and visions between urban and rural school principals, and a huge gap in the quality and equality of education between urban and rural schools. Although Chinese principals are in general progressive and liberal in their fundamental beliefs and values, they perceive great difficulties in realizing their visions for ideal schools and recognize major obstacles to reform because of the existing school conditions, the national examination system, and certain policy restrictions on their autonomy and decision-making power in schools. Findings from this study provide special insight to policy makers and education reformers and urge them to create necessary policies, improve conditions, and increase autonomy and decision-making power for principals to manage and effect changes in their schools, especially those in rural and minority areas.",2021.0,2021-08-18,0,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0002a2b40045bf73bd4613bd7fd33642a6187703

10.15414/raae.2019.22.02.46-54,THE IMPACT OF SUPPORT POLICIES ON TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY OF FARMS IN KOSOVO,"The effects of support policies on technical efficiency are not clear and are very complex because the results may be either positive or negative. The effects can be positive if the money received will serve as an incentive to innovate or to switch to new technologies or can have a negative effect if the money received increase the income of the farms and as a result prefer to have more leisure time. Given the theoretical uncertainty of the impact of supporting policies on efficiency, productivity and added value, the aim of this paper is to address this issue empirically. This paper contributes to the literature for the case of Kosovo by fulfilling the following objectives (i) to measure technical efficiency of farms in Kosovo and (ii) to identify the effect of subsidies by employing a stochastic output distance function and an inefficiency effect model as the one proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995). Parametric stochastic frontier approach was employed to estimate technical efficiency and to determine the effect of exogenous variables on technical efficiency through one-step approach. The share of total subsidies to total output (%) was used as proxy for policy variable and a set of farm characteristics as exogenous variables. We used FADN of Kosovo data provided by MAFRED for 2014. The results suggest that on average a farm in Kosovo produced 15.7% of the maximum output, while the rest of the potential output was lost due to technical inefficiency. Subsidies had negative effect on technical efficiency, however insignificant.",2019.0,2019-11-01,3,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0002cf7dd6522c819ef00315956fddd0a7a13cee

10.1093/humupd/dmp032,Phenotyping male infertility in the mouse: how to get the most out of a ‘non-performer’,"BACKGROUND Functional male gametes are produced through complex processes that take place within the testis, epididymis and female reproductive tract. A breakdown at any of these phases can result in male infertility. The production of mutant mouse models often yields an unexpected male infertility phenotype. It is with this in mind that the current review has been written. The review aims to act as a guide to the ‘non-reproductive biologist’ to facilitate a systematic analysis of sterile or subfertile mice and to assist in extracting the maximum amount of information from each model. METHODS This is a review of the original literature on defects in the processes that take a mouse spermatogonial stem cell through to a fully functional spermatozoon, which result in male infertility. Based on literature searches and personal experience, we have outlined a step-by-step strategy for the analysis of an infertile male mouse line. RESULTS A wide range of methods can be used to define the phenotype of an infertile male mouse. These methods range from histological methods such as electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry, to hormone analyses and methods to assess sperm maturation status and functional competence. CONCLUSION With the increased rate of genetically modified mouse production, the generation of mouse models with unexpected male infertility is increasing. This manuscript will help to ensure that the maximum amount of information is obtained from each mouse model and, by extension, will facilitate the knowledge of both normal fertility processes and the causes of human infertility.",2009.0,2009-09-15,119,263,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0002f3eebe295df476bee32eb2d1e627756bc52e

10.3390/jcm13237023,Soft Tissue Sarcoma with Lower Limb Impairment: Development of a Specific Rehabilitation Protocol Based on Demolitive and Reconstructive Surgery Types,"Background/Objectives: Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are extremely uncommon tumors with a high rate of local recurrence that often require very demolitive surgery. The aim of our study is to propose a specific rehabilitation protocol for patients with STSs, based on the kind of demolition and reconstructive surgery performed, and evaluate its effects. Methods: The protocol was developed on the basis of the clinical experiences of physiatrists and surgeons, as well as data from the literature, recommending timelines for postural steps, verticalization, walking, and therapeutic exercises, in accordance with wound healing times and in order to prevent complications from disuse and immobility. The modified Barthel Index Scale (mBI), the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Adapted Patient Evaluation Conference System (APECS), and the 10 Meter Walk Test (10 MWT) were used to clinically evaluate patients before and after the rehabilitation treatment. Results: Thirty-one patients with primary STSs were enrolled. Following the rehabilitation program, we found a statistically significant improvement in mBI (p < 0.001), APECS (p ≤ 0.001), and NRS (p = 0.001). In a subgroup of patients (n = 18) assessed with the 10 MWT, a statistically significant increase in walking speed was observed (p = 0.012). Conclusions: Patients who completed rehabilitation following the proposed protocol, customized according to the surgical intervention type, demonstrated marked improvements in motor performance, ability in daily activities, walking, and pain. The proposed protocol can assist the multidisciplinary team of surgeons, oncologists, and rehabilitators in maintaining alignment on patient management, thereby ensuring clear indications regarding the activities that patients can and cannot undertake during the recovery period.",2024.0,2024-11-21,2,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000312ca10073b790e9e681750fcba091ea94947

10.1021/acs.est.2c00865,Applicability Domain of Polyparameter Linear Free Energy Relationship Models Evaluated by Leverage and Prediction Interval Calculation,"Polyparameter linear free energy relationships (PP-LFERs) are accurate and robust models employed to predict equilibrium partition coefficients (K) of organic chemicals. The accuracy of predictions by a PP-LFER depends on the composition of the respective calibration data set. Generally, extrapolation outside the domain defined by the calibration data is likely to be less accurate than interpolation. In this study, the applicability domain (AD) of PP-LFERs was systematically evaluated by calculating the leverage (h) and prediction interval (PI). Repeated simulations with experimental data showed that the root mean squared error of predictions increased with h. However, the analysis also showed that PP-LFERs calibrated with a large number (e.g., 100) of training data were highly robust against extrapolation error. For such PP-LFERs, the common definition of extrapolation (h > 3 hmean, where hmean is the mean h of all training compounds) may be excessively strict. Alternatively, the PI is proposed as a metric to define the AD of PP-LFERs, as it provides a concrete estimate of the error range that agrees well with the observed errors, even for extreme extrapolations. Additionally, published PP-LFERs were evaluated in terms of their AD using the new concept of AD probes, which indicated the varying predictive performance of PP-LFERs in the existing literature for environmentally relevant compounds.",2022.0,2022-02-03,13,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000342b58d2b7b06d193bb3efe2a87616ecc795b

10.1289/EHP.01109757,Vaccine-induced antibody responses as parameters of the influence of endogenous and environmental factors.,"In laboratory animals, an adequate way to assess effects of environmental exposures on the immune system is to study effects on antigen-specific immune responses, such as after sensitization to T-cell-dependent antigens. This probably also applies to testing effects in the human population. It has thus been suggested that antibody responses to vaccination might be useful in this context. Vaccination responses may be influenced by a variety of factors other than environmental ones. One factor is the vaccine itself; a second is the vaccination procedure used. In addition, the intrinsic capacity of the recipient to respond to a vaccine, which is determined by sex, genetic factors, and age, is important. Psychological stress, nutrition, and (infectious) diseases are also likely to have an impact. We reviewed the literature on vaccine response. With regard to exogenous factors, there is good evidence that smoking, diet, psychological stress, and certain infectious diseases affect vaccination titers, although it is difficult to determine to what extent. Genetic factors render certain individuals nonresponsive to vaccination. In general, in epidemiologic studies of adverse effects of exposure to agents in the environment in which vaccination titers are used, these additional factors need to be taken into consideration. Provided that these factors are corrected for, a study that shows an association of exposure to a given agent with diminished vaccination responses may indicate suboptimal function of the immune system and clinically relevant diminished immune response. It is quite unlikely that environmental exposures that affect responses to vaccination may in fact abrogate protection to the specific pathogen for which vaccination was performed. Only in those cases where individuals have a poor response to the vaccine may exogenous factors perhaps have a clinically significant influence on resistance to the specific pathogen. An exposure-associated inhibition of a vaccination response may, however, signify a decreased host resistance to pathogens against which no vaccination had been performed.",2001.0,2001-08-01,132,128,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0003594fb194f715664424f87ed5eba501ab4fa7
10.3389/fped.2023.1121677,Mapping trends and hotspot regarding testicular torsion: A bibliometric analysis of global research (2000–2022),"Background Testicular torsion is an acute scrotal disorder requiring immediate emergency treatment. Ischemic injury and reperfusion injury are important causes of oxidative stress and irreversible oxidative damage after testicular torsion. Although a large number of literatures have discussed the causes and treatment of testicular torsion, there is currently a lack of systematic exploration of the historical evolution of testicular torsion and the construction of a knowledge framework. Method The Web of Science Core Collection was searched for studies on testicular torsion published between 2000 and 2022. The basic data of the literature were analyzed by using Excel and CiteSpace software. Result A total of 1,007 publications on testicular torsion published were found in 64 countries between 2000 and 2022, with an increasing annual publication level. Early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of testicular torsion had always been at the core of clinical practice, and the pathological cascade reaction of ischemic injury and ischemia-reperfusion injury after testicular torsion were also at the core of basic research. Emphasis had been placed on the development of protective drugs for ischemia and reperfusion after testicular torsion in various countries, regions and institutions. Conclusion Over the past 20 years, the research on testicular torsion had been widely concerned. Hot topics in testicular torsion in recent years were ischemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, rat, doppler ultrasonography, diagnosis and orchiectomy. This article may provide a useful resource for clinicians and basic researchers regarding testicular torsion.",2023.0,2023-02-28,4,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00035da6b8938120d6aa8253eda0ab1ee2a54358

10.3402/jchimp.v4.22719,Percutaneous methods of left atrial appendage exclusion: an alternative to the internist,"Thromboembolic stroke from the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the most feared complication in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The cornerstone for the management of chronic non-valvular AF is stroke reduction with oral anticoagulation (OAC). However, poor compliance, maintaining a narrow therapeutic window, and major side effects such as bleeding have severely limited their use, which creates a therapeutic dilemma. As much as 20% of AF patients are not receiving OAC due to contraindications and less than half of AF patients are not on OAC due to reluctance of the prescribing physician and/or patient non-compliance. Fortunately, over the past decade, there have been great interests in providing an alternative strategy unbeknownst to the practicing internist. The introduction of percutaneous approaches for LAA occlusion has added a different dimension to the management of chronic AF in patients with OAC intolerance. Occlusion devices such as the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug and WATCHMAN device are currently being investigated for stroke prophylaxis. More recently, the LARIAT device may provide an alternative means for potential stroke prophylaxis without the need for short-term post-procedural OAC. We aim to review the current literature and bring attention to an alternative strategy for high-risk AF patients intolerant to OAC.",2014.0,2014-01-01,4,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000392e5fb424c745153563ec1a662285fb79b0d

10.1371/journal.pone.0315849,Detecting anomalies in graph networks on digital markets,"The study examines different graph-based methods of detecting anomalous activities on digital markets, proposing the most efficient way to increase market actors’ protection and reduce information asymmetry. Anomalies are defined below as both bots and fraudulent users (who can be both bots and real people). Methods are compared against each other, and state-of-the-art results from the literature and a new algorithm is proposed. The goal is to find an efficient method suitable for threat detection, both in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency. It should scale well and remain robust on the advancements of the newest technologies. The article utilized three publicly accessible graph-based datasets: one describing the Twitter social network (TwiBot-20) and two describing Bitcoin cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin OTC and Bitcoin Alpha). In the former, an anomaly is defined as a bot, as opposed to a human user, whereas in the latter, an anomaly is a user who conducted a fraudulent transaction, which may (but does not have to) imply being a bot. The study proves that graph-based data is a better-performing predictor than text data. It compares different graph algorithms to extract feature sets for anomaly detection models. It states that methods based on nodes’ statistics result in better model performance than state-of-the-art graph embeddings. They also yield a significant improvement in computational efficiency. This often means reducing the time by hours or enabling modeling on significantly larger graphs (usually not feasible in the case of embeddings). On that basis, the article proposes its own graph-based statistics algorithm. Furthermore, using embeddings requires two engineering choices: the type of embedding and its dimension. The research examines whether there are types of graph embeddings and dimensions that perform significantly better than others. The solution turned out to be dataset-specific and needed to be tailored on a case-by-case basis, adding even more engineering overhead to using embeddings (building a leaderboard of grid of embedding instances, where each of them takes hours to be generated). This, again, speaks in favor of the proposed algorithm based on nodes’ statistics. The research proposes its own efficient algorithm, which makes this engineering overhead redundant.",2024.0,2024-12-23,0,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0003ab80f06edd6055d7973a0de2246f201e4bbf

10.5815/ijmecs.2019.10.05,Recent and Frequent Informative Pages from Web Logs by Weighted Association Rule Mining,"Web Usage Mining provides efficient ways of mining the web logs for knowing the user’s behavioral patterns. Existing literature have discussed about mining frequent pages of web logs by different means. Instead of mining all the frequently visited pages, if the criterion for mining frequent pages is based on a weighted setting then the compilation time and storage space would reduce. Hence in the proposed work, mining is performed by assigning weights to web pages based on two criteria.

Oral pathogens may lead to microbial products spreading into the systemic circulation and reaching distant organs, while periodontal diseases have been related to low-grade systemic inflammation. Gut and oral microbiota alterations might play a role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including arthritis, considering the role of the gut–joint axis in the regulation of molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of these conditions. In this scenario, it is hypothesized that probiotics might contribute to the oral and intestinal micro-ecological balance and could reduce low-grade inflammation typical of periodontal diseases and arthritis. This literature overview aims to summarize state-of-the-art ideas about linkages among oral–gut microbiota, periodontal diseases, and arthritis, while investigating the role of probiotics as a potential therapeutic intervention for the management of both oral diseases and musculoskeletal disorders.",2023.0,2023-02-27,10,142,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00041ebbbba434fcb47b836ba422fecb1bb9b90c

Comparison between the PW-LDA, GGA-PBE, GGA-RPBE, GGA-revPBE, and hybrid HSE06 functionals is considered through bulk, clean surface and CO adsorption calculations. The choice of the functional is found to have a strong influence in the description of single CO adsorption on the surface model proposed in literature. As expected from the so called ""CO adsorption puzzle"", differences in the obtained results demonstrate that classic LDA and PBE functionals can only partially describe the complex CO adsorption bonding scenario on a surface containing transition metal elements (in this case Pd atoms), where the energies of the substrate-adsorbate electronic states are shifted, yielding important differences in the absolute values of the adsorption energies, vibrational frequencies and surface-adsorbate interaction.

One consistent strategy to lower costs involves faculty labor. Institutions have outsourced educational missions to a largely contingent workforce to decrease instructional costs; over the last two decades, the number of adjunct or part-time faculty now comprises 70% of all faculty. As a result, policies have decreased instructional costs and provided administrators with increased flexibility to respond to student demands. However, research indicates compromised student outcomes, less shared governance, and faculty work–life pressures that can undermine commitment, motivation, and professional identity. The following literature review examines the locus of academic capitalism and faculty labor, theorizing how faculty labor policies infer consequences for equity, inclusion, and social justice in higher education.",2022.0,2022-12-13,5,77,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004d51e63143123d76f7af9277957452585cab8

10.12913/22998624/142213,Cross‐Comparison of Evolutionary Algorithms for Optimizing Design of Sustainable Supply Chain Network under Disruption Risks,"Optimization of a sustainable supply chain network design (SSCND) is a complex decision-making process which can be done by the optimal determination of a set of decisions and constraints such as the selection of suppliers, transportation-related facilities and distribution centres. Diff erent optimization techniques have been applied to handle various SSCND problems. Metaheuristic algorithms are developed from these techniques that are commonly used to solving supply chain related problems. Among them, Genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are implemented as optimization solvers to obtain supply network design decisions. This paper aims to compare the performance of these two evolutionary algorithms in optimizing such problems by minimizing the total cost that the system faces to potential disruption risks. The mechanism and implementation of these two evolutionary algorithms is presented in this paper. Also, using an optimization considers ordering, purchasing, inventory, transportation, and carbon tax cost, a numerical real-life case study is presented to demonstrate the validity of the eff ectiveness of these algorithms. A comparative study for the algorithms performance has been carried out based on the quality of the obtained solution and the results indicate that the GA performs better than PSO in fi nding lower-cost solution to the addressed SSCND problem. Despite a lot of research literature being done regarding these two algorithms in solving problems of SCND, few studies have compared the optimization performance between GA and PSO, especially the design of sustainable systems under risk disruptions.",2021.0,2021-12-01,2,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004e8704bcede7396177fac56bc1fc751fc7462

Idiopathic hyperdense zones are referred in literature as enostosis, focal osteosclerosis, periapical osteopetrosis or bone scar and are found as imaging finding during a rutine radiograph. They have greater predilection for long bones, but can also appear in the maxillary bones in certain occasions, often located in the jaw, especially in the molar region, with an informed incidence rate that varies from 2,3 to 9,7% depending on the population in which the study is being applied. In 40% of the cases, in spite of being of idiopathic origin, they seem to be associated with patients with occlusal trauma or can be a result of a predominant development of isolated bone during bone growth. The case of a 36-year-old female patient is described, who presents hyperdensity that differs in form, location and imaging features from the commonly documented in this type of anatomical variations.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA) members. NATA ‘Research Survey Request’ was contacted to obtain 1,000 e-mail addresses of ATs who actively worked in the secondary school setting. We evaluated AT employment, access to team physicians, and usage of up-to-date policy and procedure manuals within different residential areas (urban, suburban, and rural) and school distinctions (public vs. private). Results: Two-hundred ninety-six responses were received (30% response rate). The majority (72%) of ATs reported having an assigned team physician for their school. Approximately one-third (36%) of ATs reported being employed by a hospital, clinic, or outreach facility. Fifty-one percent of ATs reported having a policy and procedure manual that was developed and reviewed with their team physician. There was a significantly greater amount of suburban ATs who reported having an up-to-date policy and procedure manual (urban 45% vs. suburban 60% vs. rural 39%; p = 0.007). Significantly more ATs who were employed in a public school setting reported conducting annual policy and procedure manual reviews than those employed in private school settings (public 63% vs. private 49%; p = 0.045). Conclusions: The majority of ATs have assigned team physicians and a third is employed by a medical group. A high number of ATs reported not having a policy and procedure manual that was developed and reviewed with their team physician. Sports medicine teams within secondary schools, particularly in private schools, should strive to develop and maintain an up-to-date policy and procedure manual that is frequently reviewed with their team physician.",2020.0,2020-01-21,1,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000575c005432cee96d42b91e221a9ef2238b46e

10.1371/journal.pone.0300780,Evaluating population-level interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in healthcare and community settings: A systematic review protocol,"Background Inappropriate antibiotic use contributes significantly to the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance. While government-initiated population-level interventions are fundamental in addressing this issue, their full potential remains to be explored. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing inappropriate antibiotic use among antibiotic providers and users in healthcare and community settings. Methods We will conduct a systematic literature search across multiple databases and grey literature sources. We will include studies which evaluate the effectiveness of population-level interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in healthcare and community settings in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. This includes government-initiated measures targeting antibiotic use through education, restriction, incentivization, coercion, training, persuasion, context modification, behavior modeling, or barrier reduction. Two reviewers will independently perform screening to select eligible studies, followed by data extraction. The outcomes of interest are various measures of antibiotic prescription and consumption, such as Defined Daily Dose (DDD) or number of prescriptions per year. We anticipate including a broad range of study designs and outcome measures. Therefore, we will narratively synthesize results using the categories of the population-level policy interventions of the Behavior Change Wheel Framework.

10.4103/jehp.jehp_356_18,Awareness and acceptance of H1N1 vaccination among physicians: Experience of 2017 vaccination campaign,"CONTEXT: India experienced pandemic phase of H1N1 in May 2009 to December 2010. The postpandemic phase went on from January 2011 to December 2014. As per the WHO, all countries should immunize their health-care workers as a first priority to protect the essential health infrastructure. AIMS: The aim of the study is to assess the level of awareness and acceptance of influenza vaccine among physicians and also the perception of physicians regarding H1N1 infection. This study also examined time of vaccine administration in relation with efficacy concerns based on literature. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A vaccination campaign was conducted for all health-care workers of Seth GSMC and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, in the month of July 2017 based on which a cross-sectional observational study was conducted among the physicians of the same institute. METHODS: After ethical clearance, a prevalidated pretested survey based on a pilot survey of 20 physicians was distributed among physicians, which was based on the awareness and acceptance of H1N1 vaccination among physicians and perception of H1N1 infection. Effective sample size was 272. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were generated for the survey responses. All the continuous variables were reported as mean, median, and range. Categorical variables were reported as tables and pie charts. P < 0.05 was taken as significant. Data analysis was done with SPSS version 21. RESULTS: The overall vaccine compliance was 29.8%. This study has found that area of work, deficiency in knowledge about adverse effect of vaccine, misconceptions regarding vaccine, and concerns about efficacy and duration of vaccine are the important factors which lead to decreased vaccine compliance. Furthermore, it is found during the study that timing of vaccination was not given due importance as considering the epidemiological pattern. CONCLUSIONS: More emphasis should be given to education sessions and counseling of physicians regarding H1N1 vaccination and oseltamivir therapy. At administrative level, more focus should be given on timing of vaccination and other logistics. Vaccine campaigns should be conducted ideally 1 month before expected rise in cases. Quadrivalent vaccine would be more appropriate over trivalent based on epidemiology of infection in India.",2019.0,2019-04-24,6,20,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005f9ae03152d7e977930cf3a21f9008a757b6a

This study contributes to the sparse literature on competition and primary care quality by examining recent competition enhancing reforms in Sweden. The reforms aimed to stimulate patient choice and entry of private providers across the country but affected markets differently depending on the initial market structure. We exploit the heterogeneous impact of the reforms in a difference-in-differences strategy, contrasting more and less exposed markets over the period 2005-2013. Although the reforms led to substantially more entry of new providers in more exposed markets, the effects on primary care quality were modest: We find small improvements of patients' overall satisfaction with care, but no consistently significant effects on avoidable hospitalisation rates or satisfaction with access to care. We find no evidence of economically meaningful quality reductions on any outcome measure.",2020.0,2020-03-18,27,52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000620572740b0562160536ea797e5e8475618db

Recent studies have shown promising effects of these in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). However, there may be an increased risk of developing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients treated with these. Our study aims to analyze the association between the risk of UTI in patients treated with SGLT2i. A systematic review of the literature was carried out by randomized clinical trials, totalizing at the end of the selection 23 articles that were statistically evaluated. The incidence of UTI was generally demonstrated in articles and in different subgroups: patients on SGLT2i monotherapy or on combination therapy; according to specific comorbidities of each sample or according to the drug used. They noticed an increase in the chance of UTI in the SGLT2i groups compared to the control groups on placebo or other oral antidiabetic agents.

10.1371/journal.pone.0088741,Comparative Analysis of Normalised Difference Spectral Indices Derived from MODIS for Detecting Surface Water in Flooded Rice Cropping Systems,"Identifying managed flooding in paddy fields is commonly used in remote sensing to detect rice. Such flooding, followed by rapid vegetation growth, is a reliable indicator to discriminate rice. Spectral indices (SIs) are often used to perform this task. However, little work has been done on determining which spectral combination in the form of Normalised Difference Spectral Indices (NDSIs) is most appropriate for surface water detection or which thresholds are most robust to separate water from other surfaces in operational contexts. To address this, we conducted analyses on satellite and field spectral data from an agronomic experiment as well as on real farming situations with different soil and plant conditions. Firstly, we review and select NDSIs proposed in the literature, including a new combination of visible and shortwave infrared bands. Secondly, we analyse spectroradiometric field data and satellite data to evaluate mixed pixel effects. Thirdly, we analyse MODIS data and Landsat data at four sites in Europe and Asia to assess NDSI performance in real-world conditions. Finally, we test the performance of the NDSIs on MODIS temporal profiles in the four sites. We also compared the NDSIs against a combined index previously used for agronomic flood detection. Analyses suggest that NDSIs using MODIS bands 4 and 7, 1 and 7, 4 and 6 or 1 and 6 perform best. A common threshold for each NDSI across all sites was more appropriate than locally adaptive thresholds. In general, NDSIs that use band 7 have a negligible increase in Commission Error over those that use band 6 but are more sensitive to water presence in mixed land cover conditions typical of moderate spatial resolution analyses. The best performing NDSI is comparable to the combined index but with less variability in performance across sites, suggesting a more succinct and robust flood detection method.",2014.0,2014-02-20,172,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00064978c9768ac4a8e2535cd07cf4aa059dd50a

10.12845/sft.57.1.2021.1,Guidelines for the Use of Voice Alarm Systems Based on the Analysis of Normative and Legal Documents Used in Selected European Countries,"Purpose: The aim of this publication is to present the results of theoretical research – evaluation of normative and legal documents used for the design and installation of voice alarm systems (VAS) in selected European countries. The aim of the research was to analyze and compare the functioning of voice alarm systems in Poland against the background of selected European countries. Introduction: Voice alarm systems are systems installed in buildings that enable the broadcast of warning signals and voice messages for the safety of people in the building. Mandatory use of voice alarm systems in selected buildings became applicable in Poland on January 16, 2006. In Europe, these systems have been present before. Over the years, there has been development of both the devices included in the systems, as well as the normative documents and legal acts that describe these systems. Methods: Within the research process, theoretical research was used, such as: analysis of literature and legal documents, synthesis, generalization, inference, comparison and analogy. As part of the research, documents from such countries as Poland, Great Britain (mainly England), Sweden, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands were analyzed. The selection of individual countries was guided by the level of development of these systems in a given country and the availability of source documents. Conclusions: The presented analysis of the requirements for the use of voice alarm systems shows how different the approach to the use of this type of systems is. Depending on individual experiences and the administrative structure of a given country, a variety of regulations, whether legal or normative (not always normative documents issued by state standardization institutions), can be seen in the field of voice alarm systems application. Unfortunately, one can get the impression that voice alarm systems are still not as popular as fire detection systems. The definition of the requirements for buildings in which the use of voice alarm systems should be obligatory and the requirements for the determination of the required level of speech intelligibility consti- tute the basis for the consistent development of this type of fire protection equipment. Such requirements should be specified either in legal regulations or in normative acts dedicated to voice alarm systems.

10.3126/bjhs.v5i3.33686,Significance of Ultrasound in Diagnosis of Various Musculoskeletal Disorder,"Introduction: Ultrasound is a safe, highly cost effective and non-invasive imaging technique without any absolute contraindication. It is also one of the most useful investigations in all medical specialities worldwide. The trend of use of ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of various musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) is tremendously rising in orthopedics practice in Nepal over the last few years. 
Objectives: The study was conducted to fulfill the existing lacunae in medical literature about use and benefits of ultrasound in context of Nepal. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of ultrasound in the diagnosis of MSD among patients attending orthopedic department. 
Methodology: All the consecutive patients who visited department of orthopedics and received the diagnosis of MSD and had undergone ultrasonography from February 2017 to February 2019 were included in the study. The effectiveness of ultrasound was evaluated by assessing the correlation between clinical and ultrasound based diagnosis. 
Results: Out of 420 patients, majorities were female (55%). Out of 6 different anatomical sites identified, maximum patients had problem around wrist and hand (31%) followed by ankle and foot (22.9%). Similarly the most common diagnosis was related to tendon pathology including tendonitis, tenosynovitis and tendinopathy (31.9%). There was statistically significant correlation between ultrasound and clinical diagnosis with P value <0.01. 
Conclusion: Overuse tendon injury are common pathology around wrist and ankle that can be diagnosed by ultrasound along with many other MSD. The use of ultrasound is gradually widening in scope but has to be performed by the expert to improve the diagnostic accuracy and also to avoid misleading diagnoses.  Since there is significant correlation between clinical and ultrasound based diagnosis, it can be beneficial even for young doctors for making effective diagnosis of MSD.",2020.0,2020-12-30,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0006f33e77297a370262e04be3fa6665bd43d9b1
10.47814/ijssrr.v7i2.1828,Sexual Dysfunction associated with Alcohol Abuse Among Male Adults: A Literature Review,"This literature review delves into the significant issue of sexual dysfunction resulting from alcohol abuse among adult males in South Africa. There is a dearth of studies on sexual dysfunction caused by chronic alcohol use. With alcohol consumption being a widespread and culturally ingrained behavior in the region, this study examines the existing body of research to elucidate the complex relationship between alcohol abuse and sexual problems in men. Articles were searched from scientific search engines such as CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), PubMed, Medline, APA Psych and INFO as well as manual searches through Google and Google Scholar search engines. Both quantitative and qualitative studies that showed the sexual dysfunction associated with alcohol abuse among male adults were included. A total of 95 articles were screened, and 8 full-text articles were ultimately included in the review. The review reveals a strong association between alcohol abuse and various forms of sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, diminished sexual desire, and performance anxiety. The detrimental effects of alcohol on the male sexual functioning are multifaceted, involving physiological, psychological, and socio-cultural factors. This literature review offers a thorough examination of the significant concern of sexual dysfunction arising from alcohol abuse in adult males. It underscores the necessity of acknowledging and addressing the intricate relationship between alcohol use and sexual health to formulate effective prevention and treatment strategies. The study advocates for additional research on the same topic, emphasizing the need to inform healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers.

10.7557/3.6482,Needles in an ocean haystack: using environmental DNA to study marine mammals in the North Atlantic,"Marine mammals in the North Atlantic have experienced severe depletions due to overexploitation. While some species and populations have now recovered, there are numerous other anthropogenic activities impacting their North Atlantic ecosystem. Studying marine mammals is often associated with logistical challenges, and many species have an elusive nature, resulting in substantial knowledge gaps on the distribution, abundance and diversity of marine mammals in the North Atlantic. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging tool in biodiversity monitoring and has successfully been demonstrated to complement traditional monitoring methods for a wide range of marine taxonomic groups. The promising potential of seawater eDNA is owe to advances within an array of molecular methods used to extract, detect and/or sequence the genetic material of marine organisms from a single seawater sample.  
We present a literature review of eDNA studies of marine mammals and discuss the potential applications and practical challenges of eDNA in marine mammal research, management and conservation.  
Environmental DNA has already been introduced to a wide range of applications within marine mammal science, from detection of endangered species to population genetic assessments. Furthermore, eDNA has the power to capture other biologically important species in the marine ecosystem and food web, which could facilitate insight into the spatiotemporal variation of different marine communities in a changing environment. With methodological and technological standardization, eDNA based approaches have a promising potential to be integrated into regular monitoring practices and management strategies.",2022.0,2022-12-19,3,88,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00070df5d4134869d0cb31b8e2461ba11b9e8e39

The reference consulting service is the most valuable part of developing collections, increasing comprehensive service ability, and revealing a library's social roles in the information age. The change in user demands has accelerated the transfer process which shifts the focus of library reference work from the literature retrieval to the individualized, information-oriented deep content mining, or metrology analysis. Improving the new service capacity to accomplish library service transformation is also an important goal of functional improvements to the National Library of China.

10.36594/jtec/e6v6n2a3,Museum Sebagai Inovasi Destinasi Alternatif Wellness Tourism,"Wellness tourism is a form of tourism activity that is predicted to become a form of tourist travel with high interest in 2023. In line with this, the stigma of wellness tourism that has developed in society tends to lead to resort and spa tourism, which does provide refreshing services. physical and psychological health. The limited ability of the community to access this form of resort and spa tourism has opened a gap to develop a new destination, which can also fulfill physical and psychological refreshments. This research aims to dig deeper into this gap, to find the potential for innovation in using museums as wellness tourism destinations. This research was conducted using a literature study method, using a Literature Review and Meta[1]ethnography approach. This approach was chosen, because it is hoped that the conclusions from this research can become a new idea for innovation in museum attractions in Indonesia. Data collection was carried out by reviewing various previous studies related to museums and wellness tourism. Data processing resulting from the literature review is carried out through a synthesis system, where all previous research results are recorded, classified, and then concluded. The results obtained from this research show that developing museums as an alternative to wellness tourism is very possible. Theoretical principles of wellness tourism that can be applied to museums include wellness being multi-dimensional, wellness being relatively subjective or perceptual, spiritual, physical, and intellectual. The criteria for museums to be able to fulfill the above principles are formulated as 1) the museum must have an area large enough to support tourist walking activities, 2) the museum collection has a cultural and historical background, 3) the exhibition layout is neat and equipped with clear supporting information, and 4) the museum must be calm enough to support the relaxation process.",2023.0,2023-12-31,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000770d54ff1225a8e9a13f1c01e9062f8fd36d7

Permasalahan hari ini seiring dengan adanya globalisasi membuat berbagai budaya asing masuk dengan bebas dalam alam pikir peserta didik, sehingga mengakibatkan berbagai perilaku yang tidak baik, seperti narkoba, tidak sopan pada orang lain, dan berorientasi materialistis. Atas dasar itu penulisa naskah ini menggunakan studi kepustakaan untuk mengkaji berbagai kajian-kajian terdahulu atas integrasi nilai-nilai budaya dan karakter dalam kurikulum Pendidikan Pancasila dan Kewarganegaraan. Hasil penelusuran menunjukkan bahwa integrasi nilai-nilai budaya dan karakter bangsa bukan merupakan suatu mata pelajaran tunggal, akan tetapi merupakan aspek pendidikan yang terintegrasi pada setiap mata pelajaran, terutama Pendidikan Pancasila dan Kewarganegaraan. Aspek adatif dalam kurikulum juga tercermin dalam pelaksanaan kurikulum Pendidikan Pancasila dan Kewarganegaraan yang bertitik tolak pada kemampuan guru mengelaborasi kurikulum dalam proses pembelajaran. Berdasarkan hal tersebut, dapat dipahami bahwa integrasi nilai budaya dan karakter bangsa menjadi perhatian serius dari stakeholdes bidang pendidikan di Indonesia, serta perlu adanya dukungan kemampuan guru untuk dapat mengimplementasikan dengan optimal dalam proses pembelajaran.  ABSTRACTCharacter development in students is a very important thing, because knowledge without being accompanied by good character certainly will not be implemented optimally. Today's problems along with globalization have made various foreign cultures enter freely in the minds of students, resulting in various bad behaviors, such as drugs, being disrespectful to others, and materialistic orientation. On that basis the writing of this manuscript uses literature studies to examine various previous studies on the integration of cultural values and character in the Pancasila and Citizenship Education curriculum. The search results show that the integration of cultural values and national character is not a single subject, but an integrated aspect of education in each subject, especially Pancasila and Citizenship Education. The adaptive aspects of the curriculum are also reflected in the implementation of the Pancasila and Citizenship Education curriculum which is based on the teacher's ability to elaborate on the curriculum in the learning process. Based on this, it can be understood that the integration of cultural values and national character is a serious concern of stakeholders in the field of education in Indonesia, and there is a need for support for the ability of teachers to be able to implement it optimally in the learning process.",2022.0,2022-11-28,8,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000771659af13cfe9c03661e8db7d581d9e3653f
10.1093/eurpub/ckaa172,Declared funding and authorship by alcohol industry actors in the scientific literature: a bibliometric study,"Abstract Background Alcohol industry actors are known to be involved in scientific research. Despite concerns regarding bias, the extent of involvement and coverage of this research are unknown. Methods We aimed to investigate the extent and type of scientific research 1918–2019 which was supported by the alcohol industry, including alcohol companies themselves and other organizations, such as trade associations. We identified bibliographic records from the Web of Science suite of databases which have named alcohol companies or organizations in the fields relating to author affiliations and support declarations. We then ascertained trends in publications over time, type of support, funding, outlets (such as journal titles), subject areas covered (such as health) and named companies (such as Carlsberg) and organizations (such as Drinkaware). Results The analysis included 13 481 unique records, 11 014 (82%) were authored or funded by alcohol companies and 2488 (18%) were authored or funded by other organizations. The majority of the records (90%, 12 157/13 481) were journal publications. The most common subject areas covered by the publications were biology (5415/13 481, 40%), chemistry (3937/13 481, 29%) and health (3707/13 481, 27%). In line with general publishing trends, there has been an overall increase in research funded or supported by alcohol companies and organizations since records began. The main exception is the steady decline in company author affiliations, particularly in health-related topics since the mid-1990s. Conclusions Alcohol companies and related organizations are extensively involved in or supporting scientific research according to data in Web of Science. This does not, however, necessarily reflect the totality of scientific research produced by alcohol companies and related organizations.",2020.0,2020-09-17,16,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0007772bc68a6f014f97f6869d454791ebefa602
10.1111/ggi.15098,Eye care practitioners and falls prevention for older adults: A scoping review,"Aim Eye care practitioners are well‐placed in the community to provide falls prevention advice to older adults, but existing literature offers scant insight into whether this occurs in practice. This scoping review aimed to map and synthesize the evidence for community eye care practitioners' awareness and behaviors in falls prevention in older adults, as well as barriers and enablers to implementation of falls evidence. Methods This review process was guided by the Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews and PRISMA‐ScR guidelines. MEDLINE, CINAHL Complete, Embase, Web of Science and OpenMD were searched for published and gray literature between January 1990 to October 2024. Data were mapped against the World Falls Guidelines framework of: (i) risk stratification, (ii) assessment, and (iii) management, and a barriers and enablers framework. Results A total of 19 sources met the inclusion criteria. Few studies directly captured results from eye care practitioners. The results suggested a gap in implementation of falls guideline evidence. Community eye care practitioners had low levels of awareness about falls, and were not routinely implementing falls history taking, risk stratification and assessment of contrast, visual fields, and stereopsis. Eye care practitioners might not be referring patients for exercise and environmental interventions. Conclusion The evidence suggests that eye care practitioners have some awareness of falls prevention, but might benefit from better understanding of evidence‐based falls guidelines. There appeared to be gaps that exist between evidence and translation into practice. Future studies should explore practitioner experiences and implementation efforts to improve falls prevention in community eye care.

Evidence from Douyin (TikTok),"Mobile short-form video (MSFV) shopping represents an emerging method of mobile e-commerce and indicates the future development trend of mobile e-commerce. Unlike other famous mobile commerce applications, MSFV apps provide customers with animated videos which enable them to view product information vividly. This study examines the associations between digital customer experience and customer loyalty based on a human–computer interaction approach. We draw on content quality, relationship quality, and stickiness to investigate customer attitudinal loyalty and behavioral loyalty. A total of 796 users who use the leading MSFV app in China were randomly surveyed, among whom 778 users were involved in testing the hypotheses. Our findings indicate that content and relationship quality positively influence customers’ stickiness to MSFV shopping. Moreover, stickiness positively mediates the indirect link between content quality and customer loyalty as well as relationship quality and customer loyalty. This study demonstrates the value of extending the human-computer interaction approach to MSFV shopping and contributes to the existing literature by offering a deeper understanding of customer loyalty in the context of MSFV shopping. In addition, it has some managerial implications for making the most of the MSFV app’s huge potential to help the sustainable growth of mobile e-commerce.",2022.0,2022-08-31,23,75,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00078373b700f1641101a842aca5d451ad4db7ff
10.2478/eustu-2022-0072,Greening of European Cities: Social Benefits of Urban Nature for Urban Air Quality,"Summary While current climate and environmental efforts are mostly focused on the necessary and urgent CO2 emissions cuts, energy transition and climate adaptation, other not least pressing issues such as air quality start reaching the political agenda (European Commission, 2019). In this paper, we address air pollution from the social welfare perspective and bring together two strings of literature on the productivity of green urban infrastructure for ambient air quality and the monetisation of air quality improvements. Based on the EU air quality data by country and city, we identify those regions, which would benefit most from improved urban green infrastructure to improve air quality performance in Europe. We review a set of academic literature on the impact of urban green combating urban air pollution, and provide a synthesis review of social externality costs connected to urban air pollution. We extrapolate, in a stylized manner, the effect of increasing urban vegetation throughout the EU and in a selection of EU cities. Our estimates show that additional 1m2 of green cover throughout the EU cities would lead to 65,9 mln EUR of benefit per year, split about equally between the benefits of improved air quality and carbon sequestration, equivalent to 976 euros per ha per year for air pollutants and 1024 euros per ha per year for carbon abatement.",2021.0,2021-12-01,3,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0007bafbd4a126ac51ecb2af1ae82a54083ae108

After exposure to indomethacin, human umbilical vein endothelial cells have shown increased procoagulant activity. Thrombosis in rabbit auricular veins has been observed after injection of tenoxicam with its diluent or of the diluent alone. Human studies evaluating venous endothelium after tenoxican injection were not found in the literature. This study aimed at evaluating whether tenoxicam with 0.9% sodium chloride changes the venous endothelium of rabbits as it is observed when associated to its diluent (bidistilled water).


METHODS
The study involved 90 rabbits (2000 and 3500 grams) divided in two groups: Control group, which received 0.9% NaCl; Experimental group, which received tenoxicam (20 mg) with bidistilled water or with 0.9% NaCl. A constant volume of 2 ml was administered to both groups. Anesthesia was induced with acepromazine maleate, ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine hydrochloride, and the puncture of right and left caudal auricular veins was performed with a 27G butterfly needle. Animals were confined for 6 hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs, when they were once more anesthetized and sacrificed, with extraction of the auriculae at their base, followed by microscopic venous study.


RESULTS
Thrombosis was observed in 19.4% of the Experimental Group after the administration of tenoxicam with bidistilled water and in 22.2% after the administration of tenoxicam with 0.9% sodium chloride. In the Control group, which has only received 0.9% sodium chloride, no thrombosis was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
It was possible to conclude that tenoxicam, either with bidistilled water or 0.9% sodium chloride, has induced thrombosis in the veins it was injected.",2002.0,2002-04-01,1,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0008a4503056ee9aa9c24594dfc90a06ff7f4144

Despite numerous reports in the literature, many clinicians and laboratorians remain unaware of this issue. In this brief review, a series of virology case examples is presented. However, a false-positive IgM can occur with any pathogen. Thus, when an accurate diagnosis is essential for therapy, prognosis, infection control, or public health, when the patient is sick enough to be hospitalized, or when the clinical or epidemiologic findings do not fit, IgM detection should not be accepted as a stand-alone test. Rather, whenever possible, the diagnosis should be confirmed by other means, including testing of serial samples and the application of additional test methods.",2016.0,2016-05-18,84,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00092592f4922b5ef024100f96a5b9b495fb5f32

The purpose of this review was to examine the efficacy of botulinum toxin in the treatment of infantile esotropia and to evaluate the average response of BT and its complication rates.


Methods
A research was performed in the Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial (CENTRAL). The database was searched between December 28, 2016 and January 30, 2017. The selection was restricted to articles published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. There were no date restrictions in the search.


Results
Nine studies were eligible for inclusion. The grouped success rate of BT treatment in infantile esotropia was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61%-89%). For the success rate, I2 of 94.25% was observed, indicating a high heterogeneity (P < 0.001). The complication rates were also analyzed. The grouped consecutive exotropia (XT) rate was 1% (95% CI: 0%-2%). The grouped ptosis rate was 27% (95% CI: 21%-33%). The grouped vertical deviation rate was 12% (95% CI: 4%-22%). The mean change of the deviation after BT injection was -30.7 (95% CI: -37.7, -23.8), demonstrating a significant improvement in alignment.


Conclusions
Botulinum toxin injection into medial recti muscles reveals to be a safe procedure and a valuable alternative to strabismus surgery in congenital esotropia, especially in moderate deviations.",2017.0,2017-10-01,39,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000935ec11d7391a339eca0a0ca11c0ed766c799
10.1371/journal.pone.0157528,Osteology of Carnufex carolinensis (Archosauria: Psuedosuchia) from the Pekin Formation of North Carolina and Its Implications for Early Crocodylomorph Evolution,"Crocodylomorphs originated in the Late Triassic and were the only crocodile-line archosaurs to survive the end-Triassic extinction. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that the closest relatives of these generally gracile, small-bodied taxa were a group of robust, large-bodied predators known as rauisuchids implying a problematic morphological gap between early crocodylomorphs and their closest relatives. Here we provide a detailed osteological description of the recently named early diverging crocodylomorph Carnufex carolinensis from the Upper Triassic Pekin Formation of North Carolina and assess its phylogenetic position within the Paracrocodylomorpha. Carnufex displays a mosaic of crocodylomorph, rauisuchid, and dinosaurian characters, as well as highly laminar cranial elements and vertebrae, ornamented dermal skull bones, a large, subtriangular antorbital fenestra, and a reduced forelimb. A phylogenetic analysis utilizing a comprehensive dataset of early paracrocodylomorphs and including seven new characters and numerous modifications to characters culled from the literature recovers Carnufex carolinensis as one of the most basal members of Crocodylomorpha, in a polytomy with two other large bodied taxa (CM 73372 and Redondavenator). The analysis also resulted in increased resolution within Crocodylomorpha and a monophyletic clade containing the holotype and two referred specimens of Hesperosuchus as well as Dromicosuchus. Carnufex occupies a key transition at the origin of Crocodylomorpha, indicating that the morphology typifying early crocodylomorphs appeared before the shift to small body size.",2016.0,2016-06-15,25,93,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000942e8da1e46235cd35ad734116235144a8c8f

10.7759/cureus.75023,A Case of Acute Epidural Hematoma Caused by Mandibular Fossa Fracture,"Acute epidural hematoma is one of the most serious traumatic conditions in neurosurgery, for which emergency surgery may be indicated. Injury to the middle meningeal artery (MMA) is generally the cause of hemorrhage, often accompanied by convexity fractures resulting from head trauma. However, an epidural hematoma by a contusion of the jaw is very rare. A 27-year-old male fell after drinking alcohol and was brought to our hospital. The patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 6 (E1V1M4), and the right pupil was 5 mm with no response to light. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed an acute epidural hematoma in the right middle skull base to the temporal region and no fracture lines of the vault of the skull. An emergency right frontotemporal craniotomy was performed to remove the hematoma. A postoperative recheck of the preoperative images revealed a right mandibular fossa fracture. The postoperative course was uneventful, with clear consciousness and resolution of motor paralysis the day after surgery. On the 11th postoperative day, the patient could walk independently and was discharged. As there was no injury to the MMA in the convexity area, which is generally the cause of acute epidural hematoma, damage to a branch of the MMA resulting from a mandibular fossa fracture was considered a possible mechanism for developing acute epidural hematoma. A case of mandibular fossa fracture resulting in acute epidural hematoma is extremely rare, and the etiology remains unknown, so we reported here with a review of the literature.",2024.0,2024-12-01,0,20,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00094e109a7e3bdd930964fcf058d57284d60108

The theory and practice of inclusive design, however, is still largely focused on considerations of physical aspects. This research attempts to fill the gap in understanding of psychosocial inclusivity in design by identifying a formal definition with constructs. Theoretical interrogation of literature (design and non-design fields) together with empirical investigations (semi-structured interviews, a creative workshop and observations) are conducted within two distinct contexts, i.e. older individuals' supermarket shopping and assisted mobility service users. The outcomes are evaluated using expert surveys. A formal definition and four evaluative constructs of psychosocial inclusivity in design are described: Cognitive, Emotional, Social and Value. The results provide first elements of an encompassing definition of psychosocial inclusivity, which is theoretically and empirically informed, and may serve as a guide for design in the future. The research enhances the knowledge of psychosocial inclusivity in design through devising a formal definition and constructs, and details the constructs within two specific contexts of supermarket shopping and assisted mobility.",2020.0,2020-12-03,14,83,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00096a08d823a95ff4041dfc519b2cef5c1204e6

10.5604/12321966.1233573,Influence of growth hormone therapy on selected dental and skeletal system parameters.,"INTRODUCTION
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is one of the main indications for growth hormone therapy. One characteristic of this disease is bone age delay in relation to the chronological age. Pituitary dysfunction negatively affects the growth and development of the jaws and teeth of the child. The secretion of endocrine glands regulates growth, development, and gender differentiation. It also controls the growth of bones and teeth, regulates metabolism of calcium and phosphate, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. The primary role in the endocrine system is played by the pituitary gland which is responsible for the production of somatotropin [1]. Dysfunction of the pituitary gland has a negative effect on the growth and development of long bones in the body, and may have an adverse effect on the development of maxilla, mandible and dentition of a child. There is some information in the literature that dental age is delayed in short stature children; the replacement of deciduous teeth by permanent teeth is also delayed, and newly erupted permanent teeth often require orthodontic treatment. Applying hormonal therapy positively affects the process of replacement of dentition [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].


OBJECTIVES
The aim of the study was to assess bone and dental age, as well as analyze the state of dentition in children diagnosed with GH deficiency treated with growth hormone, depending on the duration of treatment.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study material consisted of 110 children (27 males, 83 females), hospitalized for somatotropin hypopituitarism in the Department of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology at the Medical University of Lublin, Poland. The mean birth age was 13 years (156 months) with a standard deviation of 2 years and 6 months (30 months). 47 children (43%) started treatment with the growth hormone (group starting treatment) and 63 children (57%) whose treatment was started 2-3 years previously (group in the course of treatment). The control group consisted of 41 generally healthy children (15males, 25 females) with ENT problems, such as hypoacusis and a condition after nasal injury, hospitalized in the Department of Paediatric Otolaryngology at the Medical University of Lublin, Poland. The mean age was 11 years and 5 months (137 months) with standard deviation of 2 years and 5 months (29 months). Informed consent was obtained from the parents. The study was approved by the Bioethical Committee at the Medical University of Lublin (Resolution No. KE-0254 /216 /2012).",2017.0,2017-03-01,7,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00099c3ef392d9861158918b72ad3d18c63c1577

10.3390/jcdd9080241,Effects of Exercise on Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: An Updated Review of Literature,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents the most common HF phenotype of patients aged > 65 years, with an incidence and a prevalence that are constantly growing. The HFpEF cardinal symptom is exercise intolerance (EI), defined as the impaired ability to perform physical activity and to reach the predicted age-related level of exercise duration in the absence of symptoms—such as fatigue or dyspnea—and is associated with a poor quality of life, a higher number of hospitalizations, and poor outcomes. The evidence of the protective effect between exercise and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is numerous and long-established. Regular exercise is known to reduce cardiovascular events and overall mortality both in apparently healthy individuals and in patients with established cardiovascular disease, representing a cornerstone in the prevention and treatment of many cardio-metabolic conditions. Several studies have investigated the role of exercise in HFpEF patients. The present review aims to dwell upon the effects of exercise on HFpEF. For this purpose, the relevant data from a literature search (PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline) were reviewed. The analysis of these studies underlines the fact that exercise training programs improve the cardiorespiratory performance of HFpEF patients in terms of the increase in peak oxygen uptake, the 6 min walk test distance, and the ventilatory threshold; on the other hand, diastolic or systolic functions are generally unchanged or only partially modified by exercise, suggesting that multiple mechanisms contribute to the improvement of exercise tolerance in HFpEF patients. In conclusion, considering that exercise training programs are able to improve the cardiorespiratory performance of HFpEF patients, the prescription of exercise training programs should be encouraged in stable HFpEF patients, and further research is needed to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects described.",2022.0,2022-07-28,22,90,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0009b1aa974cc156d2dff9d8632174134df3f359

A.N.Nikolyukin in the educational process. It is noted that traditionally, in the professional training of a bachelor's philologist, two main historical and literary courses - ""History of Russian Literature"" and ""History of World Literature"" - are
studied separately from each other, and therefore a university teacher faces difficulties in teaching students the ability to
detect continuity and other relationships between national literatures and determine the meaning of these connections.
It is established that the scientific heritage of A.N. Nikolyukin, permeated with the idea of the interaction of national
literatures and the unity of the literary process, can be in demand in the professional training of both a Russian philologist

In clustering search results, prominent vocabularies, such as GO (Gene Ontology), MeSH(Medical Subject Headings) and frequent terms extracted from retrieved PubMed abstracts have been used as topics for grouping. In this study, we have proposed FNeTD (Frequent Nearer Terms of the Domain) method for PubMed abstracts clustering. This is achieved through a two-step process viz; i) identifying frequent words or phrases in the abstracts through the frequent multi-word extraction algorithm and ii) identifying nearer terms of the domain from the extracted frequent phrases using the nearest neighbors search. The efficiency of the clustering of PubMed abstracts using nearer terms of the domain was measured using F-score.

10.12998/wjcc.v9.i33.10286,Complete restoration of congenital conductive hearing loss by staged surgery: A case report,"BACKGROUND Stapedial tendon ossification is a rare disease, with only a few reports. The stapedial tendon originates from the apex of the pyramidal eminence and is attached to the neck of the stapes. In stapedial tendon ossification, the stapes is fixed, causing conductive hearing loss. In most cases, complete hearing restoration is achieved by dividing the stapedial tendon after exploratory tympanotomy. CASE SUMMARY A 28-year-old woman presented to our hospital with the major complaint of bilateral hearing loss that started during childhood. Exploratory tympanotomy was performed due to suspicion of otosclerosis or middle ear anomalies. We found bilateral conductive hearing loss due to stapedial tendon ossification with a middle ear anomaly during surgery. There have been several reports of complete recovery of hearing after resection of the stapedial tendon. However, in this case, recovery of hearing was insufficient, even with the division of the stapedial tendon. In the second surgery, the stapes anomaly and footplate fixation were confirmed, and hearing was completely recovered after stapedotomy. Therefore, we report this case with a review of the relevant literature. CONCLUSION This is the first case of stapedial tendon ossification and fixation of the footplate surgically diagnosed on both sides. With surgical treatment, successful results are expected.",2021.0,2021-11-26,2,20,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a802e37a4e84c5ea10a40306454d14bf5a57b

10.25112/RPR.V2I0.1655,O FETICHE DOS QUEPES SEBASTIANISTAS,"No limiar entre a filosofia e a poesia, existe uma territorialidade híbrida na qual se operam intercâmbios analógicos e ficções epistemológicas. E é justamente nessa área de contágio que se encontra a escritura de Teixeira Coelho, em História natural da ditadura. Através de uma narrativa filosófica. Ou seria uma filosofia narrativizada? Afinal, como bem ressalta Sartre, em toda filosofia há uma “prosa literária escondida”. No íntimo da filosofia, aloja-se a eterna tentação do poético, quer nos congratulemos com o fato, quer o deploremos. Esse inquietante texto contemporâneo de Teixeira Coelho transita por uma espacialidade em paralaxe no tocante aos diferentes sistemas de opressão e violência. Ao visitar o não-monumento a Walter Benjamin, a obra de León Ferrari ou os cárceres da ditadura brasileira, a obra propõe uma pungente reflexão fragmentada por estilhaços memorialísticos e por epifanias líricas. Como relâmpagos de poesia, a escritura filosófico-poética de Teixeira Coelho tece uma simultaneidade de sentidos: a ditadura como estado natural, a natureza da ditadura, a inacabada e constante crônica da depravação e cumplicidade com a repressão.Palavras-chave: Literatura contemporânea. Ditadura. Identidade. Poesia do pensamento.ABSTRACTAt the point where philosophy meets poetry, there is a hybrid territory in which operates analogical exchanges and epistemological fictions. And it is in precisely this area of contagion that Teixeira Coelho’s writing resides in ‘Natural History of Dictatorship’. Via a philosophical narrative. Or perhaps a narrated philosophy? After all, as Sartre points out, in all philosophy there is a “hidden literary prose”. In the depths of philosophy, lies the eternal temptation of the poetic, whether we welcome or deplore it. This disturbing contemporary text by Teixeira Coelho t moves by a spatiality in parallax as to the different systems of oppression and violence. Whether visiting the non-monument to Walter Benjamin, the work of Léon Ferrari, or the prisons of the Brazilian dictatorship, the work proposes a poignant reflection fragmented by shrapnel memoirs and lyrical epiphanies. Like poetic lightning, the philosophical-poetic writing by Teixeira Coelho weaves concurrent senses: the dictatorship as natural state, the nature of the dictatorship, the unfinished and constant chronicle of depravity and complicity with the repression.Keywords: Contemporary literature.

10.1017/s002222672400015x,Opaque morphology and phonology: Historical prefixes in English,"
 In most of the literature on English phonology, historically prefixed words such as contain, respect or submit are seen as having no morphological structure synchronically. However, such words were treated as complex in the early generative literature and are still analysed in that way in part of the literature. In this paper, we seek to review the evidence for the claim that such words are simplex words, which predicts that they should pattern with words with no internal structure in their phonological and morphological behaviours and in psycholinguistic experiments. We show that the evidence does not support that claim and shows that these words should be treated as morphologically complex units, although they differ from words with productive morphology. As these words tend to be partly or entirely opaque semantically, this raises the question of how such structures may be learned. We argue that the recurrence of forms is the main factor leading to their identification and lay out a possible order of acquisition of various morphological structures. Finally, we argue that theories of phonology may account for this by allowing the reference to morphological constituents whose semantics are impoverished.",2024.0,2024-05-16,1,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000aa8e4ad7d696e55baa1805ee62f1eb635fd40

10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2024.0191,"Robot-assisted, laparoscopic and open radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis","ABSTRACT Objectives To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC), laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC), and open radical cystectomy (ORC) in bladder cancer. Methods A literature search for network meta-analysis was conducted using international databases up to February 29, 2024. Outcomes of interest included baseline characteristics, perioperative outcomes and oncological outcomes. Results Forty articles were finally selected for inclusion in the network meta-analysis. Both LRC and RARC were associated with longer operative time, smaller amount of estimated blood loss, lower transfusion rate, shorter time to regular diet, fewer incidences of complications, and fewer positive surgical margin compared to ORC. LRC had a shorter time to flatus than ORC, while no difference between RARC and ORC was observed. Considering lymph node yield, there were no differences among LRC, RARC and ORC. In addition, there were statistically significant lower transfusion rates (OR=-0.15, 95% CI=-0.47 to 0.17), fewer overall complication rates (OR=-0.39, 95% CI=-0.79 to 0.00), fewer minor complication rates (OR=-0.23, 95% CI=-0.48 to 0.02), fewer major complication rates (OR=-0.23, 95% CI=-0.68 to 0.21), fewer positive surgical margin rates (OR=0.22, 95% CI=-0.27 to 0.68) in RARC group compared with LRC group. Conclusion LRC and RARC could be considered as a feasible and safe alternative to ORC for bladder cancer. Notably, compared with LRC, RARC may benefit from significantly lower transfusion rates, fewer complications and lower positive surgical margin rates. These data thus showed that RARC might improve the management of patients with muscle invasive or high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.",2024.0,2024-08-12,1,64,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000aacbd055565b007854427982a77b632bf3c65

10.1159/000542050,Long-Term Follow-Up of a Child with EWSR1-BEND2 Fused Spinal Astroblastoma,"Abstract Introduction Spinal astroblastoma is a rare highly malignant tumor that mainly affects children. We review the few cases described in the literature and highlight the challenges of managing this neoplasm by illustrating a case recently treated at our institutions. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of EWSR1-BEND2 fused spinal astroblastoma with long-term follow-up. Case Presentation An 8-year-old girl was transferred from her home country to Switzerland for treatment of a recurrent intramedullary tumor of the cervical spine extending from C2-C7. The tumor was primarily diagnosed as an ependymoma of the spinal cord. Prior to her transfer to our department, the patient had undergone subtotal resection of the lesion, radiation therapy, multiple chemotherapy regimens, and biopsy of the recurrent tumor. Clinically, the patient presented with tetraparesis and had recently experienced worsening upper extremity weakness with complete loss of hand function. We performed a near total resection of the recurrent tumor. Ultra-fast Nanopore seq® based DNA methylome profiling allowed confirmation of the molecular diagnosis of a high-grade neuroepithelial tumor (HGNET-MN1) consistent with astroblastoma in less than 2 h, with subsequent molecular workup revealing a EWSR1-BEND2 fusion. After surgery, the patient gradually regained function in her hands. She was sent to a specialized pediatric rehabilitation center, and while the tumor was being followed radiologically with no adjuvant treatment planned, the patient presented with a relapse of the tumor in only 3 months. Given the acute worsening of radiating pain and sudden respiratory failure, a cervical decompression was performed. MRI of the cervical spine showed infiltration of the lower aspects of the brainstem. The patient was offered palliative comfort care. Conclusion Spinal astroblastoma is a rare and highly aggressive tumor affecting children and young adults with a high recurrence rate and thus far not well-defined prognosis. The molecular signature of astroblastoma needs to be further characterized to establish a treatment-relevant classification and to allow a better prognostication. Currently, gross-total resection combined with radiotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for spinal astroblastoma.",2024.0,2024-10-18,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000ada989be74028916ad4562f38cde272f5e244

Cleaning the root canal system is a crucial stage and the main factor for a successful endodontic protocol. Inability to remove debris from inaccessible branches of the root canal system, especially from the apical region, leads to and increases the risk of secondary infection. Selection of the optimal method for activating irrigants remains a current issue. According to the results of several studies, none of the individual irrigation activation techniques allows achieving ideal cleanliness in the root canal, but the use of laser, sonic, multisonic, and ultrasonic activation significantly improves the quality of cleaning and provides a prolonged antimicrobial effect by enhancing the diffusion of intracanal antiseptics, their hydrolytic and antibacterial effectiveness, which will eventually ensure maximum adhesion of filling materials. This, in turn, indicates the absence of a unified protocol that would provide stable irrigation efficiency and long-term results in endodontic treatment. The use of a protocol with combined activation of irrigants remains an open question among clinicians and scientists.",2023.0,2023-06-20,1,21,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b2bf75d79e837c59808396f81bac2f417f887

10.1192/bjo.2024.320,Home Is Where the Health Is: Developing Medical Students’ Understanding of Homeless Health,"Aims Mental and physical ill-health are both causes and consequences of homelessness. As the cost-of-living crisis forces more people out of their homes, it is imperative that medical students are informed and prepared for this health crisis. Discussions with or about homeless populations are largely absent from the current medical school experience, and are rarely accompanied by homelessness-specific on-the-ground exposure. This project aims to use contemporary literature and the personal experience of a UK medical student to formulate suggestions on how the curriculum can better address homeless health. Methods A literature search was performed, including recent work on medical education, inclusion health, and homelessness. Reflection on the author's personal experience at medical school was conducted and compared with existing literature to ascertain validity. Results Whilst many students will walk past rough-sleepers on their way into university/hospital, homelessness is a seldom-addressed topic at medical school. In the author's personal experience, there can be a cognitive disconnect between the theoretical principles (e.g. social determinants of health, inclusion health) covered in lectures, and the on-the-ground realities of the isolation, discrimination, and violence that homeless populations face. Since medical students disproportionately come from privileged socioeconomic backgrounds, this disconnect may be due to a lack of exposure underpinned by the assumption that homelessness will never directly affect them. A review of literature highlighted several worldwide initiatives aiming to develop medical students’ understanding of homelessness. Programmes involved students in health screening, education programmes, and street psychiatry placements. These have been shown to reduce bias and improve student preparedness. Based on the overlap between literature and the author's own experiences, three focuses for curriculum improvement are proposed: supported exposure, compulsory education, and advocacy. Supported exposure would involve students having formal face-to-face contact with homeless populations, supported by supervision and debriefing. To prepare for these interactions and their potential challenges, students should receive trauma-informed training alongside teaching on inclusion health and social determinants of health. This should be emphasised by medical schools as mandatory, rather than a ‘special-interest’ topic that many students will not engage with. Finally, students should be encouraged to advocate for vulnerable patients both within the clinic, and on a broader systemic level. Conclusion This project stresses the urgent need for addressing homelessness within medical education. The proposed focuses aim to cultivate a deeper understanding among medical students about the health challenges faced by homeless populations, fostering empathy and competence in future healthcare professionals.",2024.0,2024-06-01,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b609ea28d3883df4d1f612a12001f96d41c29

Current literature illustrates limited attempts to optimize such processes in sports. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the application of Business Process Management (BPM) in healthcare (a service industry resembling sports) and formulate a model to optimize data driven player management processes in professional sports. A systematic review, adhering to PRISMA framework was conducted on articles extracted from seven databases, focused on using BPM to digitally optimize patient related healthcare processes. Literature reviews by authors was the main mode of healthcare process identification for BPM interventions. Interviews with process owners followed by process modelling were common modes of process discovery. Stakeholder and value-based analysis highlighted potential optimization areas. In most articles, details on process redesign strategies were not explicitly provided. New digital system developments and implementation of Business Process Management Systems were common. Optimized processes were evaluated using usability assessments and pre-post statistical analysis of key process performance indicators. However, the scientific rigor of most experiments designed for such latter evaluations were suboptimal. From the findings, a stepwise approach to optimize data driven player management processes in professional sports has been proposed.",2021.0,2021-11-28,4,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b6c0acd093f9318aa9dae429278b700d8943a

Stone Fruits - Pilot Studies","Freezing is the most commonly used method of preserving stone fruits. However, it is not the cheapest method. An alternative could be the pickling of fruits. Unfortunately, there is not much information in the literature on the effect of pickling on the health-promoting potential of stone fruits, including plums and cherries. This work focuses on assessing the impact of fruit pickling and storage on changes in the pro-health potential. Health-promoting properties were determined based on the content of anthocyanin dyes, vitamin C, total polyphenols, and the ability to inhibit free radicals. A substantial effect of pickling and storing pickled fruits on their health-promoting properties was observed. Pickling caused a decrease in the content of anthocyanins and vitamin C in the tested fruits. At the same time, the content of total polyphenols and the ability to reduce free radicals increased. It was also found that the content of bioactive compounds and the ability to reduce free radicals decreased during the storage of pickled cherries and plums.

10.47191/ijmscrs/v3-i10-01,The Use of Acellular Fish Skin Grafts in Diabetic Foot Ulcers Management – a Systematic Review,"Background: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) healing and management continue to be a major challenge for patients and healthcare providers, resulting in a considerable socio-economic burden. Lower-limb amputation is a severe clinical condition of DFU due to the presence of a chronic unresponsive diabetic foot ulcer with a high risk of infection, which raises morbidity and mortality rates. Rapid wound healing is necessary to prevent amputation. A recent advance in the development of applicable xenografts was acellular fish skin (AFS) grafts harvested from the North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) act as skin substitute, have a substantial lipid profile, primarily composed of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which have been shown to result in faster wound epithelialization, provide barrier protection against bacteria and alter the inflammatory profile of wounds. Due to these beneficial wound-healing properties, acellular fish skin might represent an effective treatment approach in chronic diabetic foot ulcer management. Methods: A systematic review of the literature up to July 2023 was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Titles and abstracts were screened for the following key terms (variably combined): ""fish skin"", ""fish skin grafts"", ""acellular fish skin grafts"", ""Omega3 Wound matrix"", ""Diabetic foot ulcer"", ""Chronic ulcer"", ""wound healing"". Results: The present study includes 12 trials that examined the effects of acellular fish skin grafts in diabetic foot ulcers. Compared to the standard of care, the use of acellular fish skin has been shown to accelerate wound healing resulting in reduced risk of amputation, reduced pain, reduced treatment-related costs, fewer dressing changes and improved quality of life.

10.21827/ejlw.10.37959,Tattoos Tell Stories: Children’s Literature Tattoos as a Form of Life Narrative,"Tattoos and children’s literature seem to have little in common, but they come together in the form of children’s literature tattoos, which I argue in this article to be a new form of life narrative. A lot of literary tattoos are inspired by children’s literature such as the Harry Potter-series and Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Despite being inspired by a literary work, the tattoos function as personal memoirs of childhood as well as a reflection of the tattooees’ hopes for the future and who they want to become. I empirically study these children’s literature tattoos as life narratives by combining three data sets: blogs with personal stories related to literary tattoos, an online questionnaire about the meaning of children’s literature tattoos for tattooees themselves, and semi-structured interviews. Based on my research, I argue that children’s literature tattoos tell personal stories about the tattooees and their lives and can thus be considered a form of life narrative. Children’s literature tattoos narrate what someone has been through, what someone likes, but most of all the things that shape the person and that they hope will continue to shape them in the future.",2021.0,2021-12-06,0,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000bc5befa915c5c7a5089dee58c7ea924ee9a38

10.2147/NDT.S55518,Pediatric neurofibromatosis 1 and parental stress: a multicenter study,"Background Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a complex and multifaceted neurocutaneous syndrome with many and varied comorbidities. The literature about the prevalence and degree of maternal stress and the impact of NF1 in the parent–child interaction is still scant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of maternal stress in a large pediatric sample of individuals affected by NF1. Methods Thirty-seven children (19 boys, 18 girls) of mean age 7.86±2.94 (range 5–11) years affected by typical NF1 and a control group comprising 405 typically developing children (207 boys, 198 girls; mean age 8.54±2.47 years) were included in this study. To assess parental stress, the mothers of all individuals (NF1 and comparisons) filled out the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form test. Results The two study groups were comparable for age (P=0.116), gender (P=0.886), and body mass index adjusted for age (P=0.305). Mothers of children affected by NF1 reported higher mean Parenting Stress Index-Short Form scores on the Parental Distress domain (P<0.001), Difficult Child domain (P<0.001), and Total Stress domain than the mothers of typically developing children (controls) (P<0.001). No significant differences between the two groups were found for the Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction domain (P=0.566) or Defensive Responding domain scores (P=0.160). Conclusion NF1 is considered a multisystemic and complex disease, with many still unrecognized features in pediatric patients and in their families. In this light, our findings about the higher levels of maternal stress highlight the importance of considering the environmental aspects of NF1 management in developmental age.",2014.0,2014-01-22,45,74,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000bf329f7f97049583c53d7fdd04cb6ea066073

10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002231,Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in sub-Saharan Africa: who is left behind?,"Adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) continues to be a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa where child marriage, adolescent childbearing, HIV transmission and low coverage of modern contraceptives are common in many countries. The evidence is still limited on inequalities in ASRH by gender, education, urban–rural residence and household wealth for many critical areas of sexual initiation, fertility, marriage, HIV, condom use and use of modern contraceptives for family planning. We conducted a review of published literature, a synthesis of national representative Demographic and Health Surveys data for 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and analyses of recent trends of 10 countries with surveys in around 2004, 2010 and 2015. Our analysis demonstrates major inequalities and uneven progress in many key ASRH indicators within sub-Saharan Africa. Gender gaps are large with little evidence of change in gaps in age at sexual debut and first marriage, resulting in adolescent girls remaining particularly vulnerable to poor sexual health outcomes. There are also major and persistent inequalities in ASRH indicators by education, urban–rural residence and economic status of the household which need to be addressed to make progress towards the goal of equity as part of the sustainable development goals and universal health coverage. These persistent inequalities suggest the need for multisectoral approaches, which address the structural issues underlying poor ASRH, such as education, poverty, gender-based violence and lack of economic opportunity.",2020.0,2020-01-01,162,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c297abd768483fd1222ed4edbfae31a3a21a5

Methods: A systematic search was performed using 5 databases, grey literature search tools, citation tracking, and contact with palliative care experts across the world. Current CPGs accredited by an international, national, or regional authority, published in English, German, French, or Italian, were subjected to content analysis. Results: In total, 35 CPGs from 14 countries and 1 international CPG were included in the analysis. The CPGs had diverse formal characteristics. Their thematic scope was difficult to analyze and compare because of differences in the terms and definitions of palliative sedation in those texts. We identified 3 main situations: (1) CPGs with a fully explicit thematic scope; (2) CPGs with a partially explicit thematic scope; and (3) CPGs without an explicit thematic scope. Several CPGs explicitly stated what forms of sedation were excluded from the text. However, this presentation was often confusing. Conclusion: Our review provides several pieces of information that could guide international reflections in this field, and be used to develop or update CPGs at all levels. Efforts should be made to clarify the thematic scope of each CPG on palliative sedation, in order to generate an understanding of the forms of this therapy addressed in the text.",2022.0,2022-11-28,7,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c6978b48f6bf51250699b9022f22bd9e14b85

One possible explanation for the inconsistent findings on its efficacy is that only certain subpopulations of patients benefit from this therapy. Objective The purpose of this narrative review is to succinctly summarize the existing data on the predictive factors of clinical response to intra-articular hyaluronic acid to identify the patient profile most likely to benefit from this therapy. Methods For this narrative review, a PubMed search was conducted in January 2023, with no date limits, to identify publications reporting predictive factors of response to viscosupplementation using the following terms: hyaluronic acid OR viscosupplem* AND osteoarthritis AND knee AND predict*. Searches were limited to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, or observational studies written in English. Other relevant references were identified by searching the references of retrieved articles. Results The disease severity was found to reliably predict response to intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections; patients with less severe disease consistently had a more robust therapeutic response than those with more severe disease. Other clinical variables such as level of baseline pain did not reliably predict response. Body mass index, and possibly age, may also be independent predictors of the response. Conclusion A review of the existing literature suggests that patients with less severe clinical symptoms and radiological findings, who are younger, and with a lower or normal body mass index are the best candidates for intra-articular hyaluronic acid therapy.",2024.0,2024-01-18,2,60,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c824a2523d14b335dc1b9b97c7092aaf715a1

Graduation registration at the Cilacap State Polytechnic is still done conventionally, causing problems such as students who are not registered in the toga data collection, students who do not return the toga according to the specified time limit. In addition, the large number of students makes the data collection process take longer. In this case, the authors conducted research that aims to build a website-based graduation registration information system. Making this system requires a research methodology. Among them are data collection methods that include literature studies, observations, and interviews as well as the system development method used, namely Rapid Application Development (RAD). The results of the questionnaire with a total score of 182 show that the system is very good in assisting BAAK in graduation registration services and monitoring the number of graduates, as well as helping students register for graduation and their completeness, and the system can help submit and confirm trouble-free forms. ",2021.0,2021-06-22,1,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c851623e9c44b44bd01935efc0a7f1ad67fbd

The flowers were extracted with ethanol and this total extract was subjected to successive bioguided fractionations to provide glycosides 1-3. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of NMR and ESI-MS spectrometric data in comparison with the existing literature and have been identified as: isorhamnetin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), diosgenin-3-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-glucopyranoside (Prosapogenin A of dioscin) (2), diosgenin-3-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-]-β-D-glucopyranoside (Deltonine) (3). The ethanolic extract has been shown to strongly inhibit the growth of breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, with an IC50 of 4.5 ± 0.7μg/mL for MDAMB-231 and 4.8 ± 0.9μg/mL for MCF-7 cells. The cytotoxic activity was related to 2 and 3 which exhibited potent cytotoxicity, with an IC50 of ± 3μM. Concerning antiplasmodial activities, only weak activities were observed using the ethanolic extract and the two saponins. The flavonoid was almost inactive. Finally, the radical-scavenging activity of the ethanolic extract was tested in presence of ABTS•+ solution. A decrease of the absorbance intensity was observed, with an IC50 value of 22.1 ± 0.6μg/mLwhile trolox, used as Standard drug, showed a pronounced activity (IC50 = 12.7±0.5μM). The glycoside 1 showed the lowest IC50 value of 20.1 ± 0.8μM while both 2 and 3 exhibited very weak radical scavenging activity.",2015.0,2015-01-01,5,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000cb34c3792b8bd771683c53c0dc3fc30383057

A Spalart–Allmaras RANS model with and without an algebraic local transition modification was employed for the resolution of multiple kinematic configurations, considering both moderate-frequency large-amplitude flapping and high-frequency small-amplitude pure heaving. The propulsive performance of the airfoils with the two modelling approaches were tested by referring to experimental and (scale-resolving) numerical data available in the literature. The results show an increase in effectiveness in predicting loads when applying the transition model. This is particularly true at low Strouhal numbers when, after laminar separation at the leading edge, vorticity dynamics appears to have a strong effect on the forces exerted on the profile. Specifically, the transition model more accurately predicts the wake topology emerging in the flow field, which is the primary influence on thrust/drag generation.",2023.0,2023-01-08,3,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000cc5514fc4918b95dc913ab99fa62ab9efc868

10.5858/arpa.2021-0612-RA,An Analysis of the Pathologic Features of Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm Based on a Comprehensive Literature Database of Cases.,"CONTEXT.—
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare hematologic malignancy with poor outcome. BPDCN diagnostically overlaps with entities such as acute myeloid leukemia, histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms, and natural killer/T-cell lymphomas. Unfortunately, large, patient-centered studies that comprehensively analyze clinical, pathologic, and other diagnostic features are lacking. As such, there is an incomplete understanding of this disease.


OBJECTIVE.—
To better characterize BPDCN, a multicenter working group consisting of hematopathologists and dermatopathologists gathered in person and remotely to review the current understanding of BPDCN, discuss specific issues regarding the diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and perform a retrospective analysis of the literature.


DATA SOURCES.—
The working group curated a database of published BPDCN patient cases (BPDCN Network literature database) following careful discussion and review, 361 articles were identified, comprising a total of 1513 individually annotated patients.


CONCLUSIONS.—
By conducting an in-depth analysis, not only did we confirm known findings such as frequent skin involvement (84% of patients; 861 of 1028) and a male predominance among older patients (>60 years old; male to female ratio of 3.5:1; 617:177), but we also identified a number of underrecognized features, such as significant central nervous system involvement (38% of cases; 24 of 64), and a more equal male to female prevalence among patients younger than 40 years (male to female ratio of 1.25:1; 167:134). Furthermore, we were able to accurately summarize the immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of this disease. BPDCN is a complex disease with distinct morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular findings. Continual updates of the literature database generated here and further analysis can allow for prospective refinement of our understanding of this orphan disease.",2022.0,2022-09-28,12,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000ccfc9c57dcb95a5d624947b4dad000d5e5137

10.3390/toxins15110658,Knowledge about Snake Venoms and Toxins from Colombia: A Systematic Review,"Colombia encompasses three mountain ranges that divide the country into five natural regions: Andes, Pacific, Caribbean, Amazon, and Orinoquia. These regions offer an impressive range of climates, altitudes, and landscapes, which lead to a high snake biodiversity. Of the almost 300 snake species reported in Colombia, nearly 50 are categorized as venomous. This high diversity of species contrasts with the small number of studies to characterize their venom compositions and natural history in the different ecoregions. This work reviews the available information about the venom composition, isolated toxins, and potential applications of snake species found in Colombia. Data compilation was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, and the systematic literature search was carried out in Pubmed/MEDLINE. Venom proteomes from nine Viperidae and three Elapidae species have been described using quantitative analytical strategies. In addition, venoms of three Colubridae species have been studied. Bioactivities reported for some of the venoms or isolated components—such as antibacterial, cytotoxicity on tumoral cell lines, and antiplasmodial properties—may be of interest to develop potential applications. Overall, this review indicates that, despite recent progress in the characterization of venoms from several Colombian snakes, it is necessary to perform further studies on the many species whose venoms remain essentially unexplored, especially those of the poorly known genus Micrurus.",2023.0,2023-11-01,1,85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000cf15d696d61db8521ff82a0e8f0b86047b53a

10.1210/clinem/dgaa513,Anti-Müllerian Hormone and Ovarian Reserve: Update on Assessing Ovarian Function,"Abstract Context Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells of small, growing follicles in the ovary. Serum AMH levels strongly correlate with the number of growing follicles, and therefore AMH has received increasing attention as a marker for ovarian reserve. This review summarizes recent findings and limitations in the application of serum AMH in ovarian reserve assessment. Evidence Acquisition A PubMed search was conducted to find recent literature on the measurements and use of serum AMH as a marker for ovarian reserve. Evidence Synthesis Serum AMH levels are measured to assess the “functional ovarian reserve,” a term that is preferred over “ovarian reserve,” since AMH levels reflect the pool of growing follicles that potentially can ovulate. Serum AMH levels are used in individualized follicle-stimulating hormone dosing protocols and may predict the risk of poor response or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but has limited value in predicting ongoing pregnancy. Serum AMH levels are studied to predict natural or disease-related age of menopause. Studies show that the age-dependent decline rates of AMH vary among women. The generalized implementation of serum AMH measurement has also led to an increase in diagnostic assays, including automated assays. However, direct comparison of results remains problematic. Conclusion Serum AMH remains the preferred ovarian reserve marker. However, the lack of an international standard for AMH limits comparison between AMH assays. Furthermore, little is known about endogenous and exogenous factors that influence serum AMH levels, which limits proper interpretation of AMH values in a clinical setting.",2020.0,2020-08-08,304,100,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000cf8a14e40582134f605fbec0b5ffefaa3efb5

10.3390/electronics13142754,A Study on a Compact Double Layer Sub-GHz Reflectarray Design Suitable for Wireless Power Transfer,"The paper presents a novel small-footprint varactor diode-based reconfigurable reflectarray (RRA) design and investigates its power reflection efficiency theoretically and experimentally in a real-life indoor environment. The surface is designed to operate at 865.5 MHz and is intended for simultaneous use with other wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency-improving techniques that have been recently reported in the literature. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no RRA intended to improve the performance of antenna-based WPT systems operating in the sub-GHz range has been designed and studied both theoretically and experimentally so far. The proposed RRA is a two-layer structure. The top layer contains electronically tunable phase shifters for the local phase control of an incoming electromagnetic wave, while the other one is fully covered by metal to reduce the phase shifter size and RRA’s backscattering. Each phase shifter is a pair of diode-loaded 8-shaped metallic patches. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to ascertain a suitable set of RRA unit cell parameters that ensure both adequate phase agility and reflection uniformity for a given varactor parameter. The RRA design parameter finding procedure followed in this paper comprises several steps. First, the phase and amplitude responses of a virtual infinite double periodic RRA are computed using full-wave solver Ansys HFSS. Once the design parameters are found for a given set of physical constraints, the phase curve of the corresponding finite array is retrieved to estimate the side lobe level due to the finiteness of the RRA aperture. Then, a diode reactance combination is found for several different RRA reflection angles, and the corresponding RRA radiation pattern is computed. The numerical results show that the side lobe level and the deviation of the peak reflected power angles from the desired ones are more sensitive to the reflection coefficient magnitude uniformity than to the phase agility. Furthermore, it is found that for scanning angles less than 50°, satisfactory reflection efficiency can be achieved by using the classical reactance profile synthesis approach employing the generalized geometrical optics (GGO) approximation, which is in accord with the findings of other studies. Additionally, for large reflection angles, an alternative synthesis approach relying on the Floquet mode amplitude optimization is utilized to verify the maximum achievable efficiency of the proposed RRA at large angles. A prototype consisting of 36 elements is fabricated and measured to verify the proposed reflectarray design experimentally. The initial diode voltage combination is found by applying the GGO-based phase profile synthesis method to the experimentally obtained phase curve. Then, the voltage combination is optimized in real time based on power measurement. Finally, the radiation pattern of the prototype is acquired using a pair of identical 4-director printed Yagi antennas with a gain of 9.17 dBi and compared with the simulated. The calculated results are consistent with the measured ones. However, some discrepancies attributed to the adverse effects of biasing lines are observed.",2024.0,2024-07-13,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d4df12750a91b406bf9bc5d9297dcdbb61eb8

10.4330/wjc.v9.i5.396,"Sleep, health behaviors, and behavioral interventions: Reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in adults","Numerous health behaviors, including physical activity, diet, smoking, and sleep, play a major role in preventing the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among these behaviors, sleep may play a pivotal role, yet it has been studied somewhat less than other behaviors and there have been few well-designed sleep intervention studies targeting CVD. Furthermore, despite the fact that these behaviors are often interrelated, interventions tend to focus on changing one health behavior rather than concurrently intervening on multiple behaviors. Psychological constructs from depression to positive affect may also have a major effect on these health behaviors and ultimately on CVD. In this review, we summarize the existing literature on the impact of sleep and other cardiac health behaviors on CVD onset and prognosis. We also describe interventions that may promote these behaviors, from established interventions such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, to more novel approaches focused on mindfulness and other positive psychological constructs. Finally, we outline population-health-level care management approaches for patients with psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression) that may impact cardiac health, and discuss their potential utility in improving mental health, promoting health behaviors, and reducing CVD-related risk. Much work is still needed to better understand how sleep and other health behaviors may uniquely contribute to CVD risk, and additional high-quality studies of interventions designed to modify cardiac health behaviors are required to improve cardiovascular health in individuals and the population at large.",2017.0,2017-05-26,18,134,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d5a5d0cfb3c7f4a29a0ee157c064721c231ad
10.1177/09514848221127623,From volume to value: Improving peri-operative elective pathways through a roadmap from fast-track orthopedic surgery,"Healthcare institutions face the pressure generated by modern medicine and society, in terms of increasing expectations and financial constraints. Chronic patients need multidisciplinary care pathways to preserve their wellbeing across the entire journey. The orthopaedic community has been particularly receptive in testing solutions to align good clinical outcomes and financial sustainability, given the increase in elective procedures provided among aging populations to alleviate pain and reduce disability. Fast-track (FT) total joint arthroplasty (TJA) and bundled payments (BPs) offer relevant examples both from the clinical and the financial perspective; however, they have not been evaluated in combination yet. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a road map to improve the value of high-volume, multidisciplinary elective procedures, with potential applications in a vast number of surgical specialties, (1) based on an integrated financial budget per episode of care (the BP), (2) building on lessons from a review of the literature on FT TJA. Although clinical outcomes vary from procedure to procedure, the coordination between the single treatments and providers involved across the patient journey; the commitment of patients and relatives; and the systematic adoption of patient-reported outcomes; can add further value for the benefit of patients, healthcare funders and providers, once essential clinical, financial and administrative conditions are guaranteed.",2022.0,2022-09-13,3,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d60fe2fce34eb6285e9537ac7256e43d6e0c6

10.16920/JEET/2021/V34I3/150016,Program Assessment and Evaluation for Continuous Quality Improvement,": Measurement of educational system / outcomes is a very complex, tedious and rigorous process. Immeasurable educational system/outcomes, means that the educational system is not properly understood or that the measurement system is not properly defined or benchmark measurement techniques are not yet developed. If educational system and its outcomes are not properly measured, then the educational system in itself is not properly understood, the goals of educational system are vaguely set and there is no process of review and refinement of quality of educational system. The intangibles of educational system must be clearly understood, well-defined and crisply measured to achieve the goals of outcome-based education and redirect the future of educational system. Measuring scholarship of knowledge in students and academic success of institutions is the key to deliver potentially skilled graduates to the society and the nation. Measurement of outcomes of education provides reliable insights for understanding the impact of education on stakeholders.

Methods 100 adults with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis found eligible for TKR by an orthopaedic surgeon in secondary care were randomised to TKR plus 12 weeks of supervised non-surgical treatment (exercise, education, diet, insoles and pain medication) or to supervised non-surgical treatment alone. Including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) data from baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, effectiveness was measured as change at 24 months. Healthcare costs and transfer payments were derived from national registries. Incremental healthcare costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted and the probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated at the 22 665 Euros/QALY threshold defined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Results TKR plus non-surgical treatment was more expensive (mean of 23 076 vs 14 514 Euros) but also more effective than non-surgical treatment (mean 24-month improvement in QALY of 0.195 vs 0.056). While cost-effective in the unadjusted scenario (ICER of 18 497 Euros/QALY), TKR plus non-surgical treatment was not cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR if needed in the adjusted (age, sex and baseline values), base-case scenario (ICER of 32 611 Euros/QALY) with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 23.2%. Including deaths, TKR plus non-surgical treatment was still not cost-effective (ICERs of 46 277 to 64 208 Euros/QALY). Conclusions From a 24-month perspective, TKR plus non-surgical treatment does not appear to be cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR if needed in patients with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis and moderate intensity pain in secondary care in Denmark. Results were sensitive to changes, highlighting the need for further confirmatory research also assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of TKR.

Nevertheless, many people are unable to access these programs due to environmental barriers. Objectives: To test the efficacy and effectiveness of a group-based, teleconference-delivered fatigue management program for people with MS. Methods: A randomly allocated two-group time series design with a wait-list control group was used. In total 190 participants were allocated (94 intervention, 96 wait-list control). Primary outcomes (fatigue impact, fatigue severity, health-related quality of life (HRQOL)) were measured before, immediately after, at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post. Secondary outcome (self-efficacy) was measured at the same points. Effectiveness (intent-to-treat) and efficacy (per protocol) analyses were conducted. Results: The program was more effective and efficacious than control for reducing fatigue impact but not fatigue severity. Before and after comparisons with the pooled sample demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness for fatigue impact, fatigue severity, and 6 of 8 HRQOL dimensions. Changes were maintained for 6 months with small to moderate effect sizes.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of MSDP on scholastic achievement in a birth cohort of children in 4th, 7th and 10th grades. Methods We analysed data from the LIFECOURSE study, a cohort study of risk and protective factors in all children born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in the year 2000 (N = 1151, girls = 49.3%). Retrospective registry data for 2014–2015 were merged with prospective survey data that were collected in April 2016. Data on MSDP were assessed during regular antenatal visits at the end of the first trimester. Standardized academic achievement scores were obtained from official school transcripts. Data were analysed using OLS regressions that were entered in three hierarchical blocks. Results Children of mothers who smoked tobacco during the first trimester consistently revealed between 5% and 7% lower scores on standardized academic achievement in 4th, 7th and 10th grade (∼6–8 points on a normally distributed 120 point scale) than those of mothers who had not smoked tobacco during this period (P < 0.05). These findings held after controlling for several factors associated with the time of birth (e.g. birth weight, maternal age at birth, birth order, parental cohabitation and household income), as well as the year of scholastic assessment (parental cohabitation, household income and parental education).

10.35580/btl.v7i1.65645,Innovation in Biology Education: Classroom Action Research as a Catalyst for the Renewal of Teaching Methods in Indonesia,"Abstract. This study emphasizes the critical importance of enhancing Classroom Action Research (CAR) as a catalyst for more sustainable Biology education. The primary factors identified include a lack of comprehensive information regarding the implementation of CAR across various regions in Indonesia and the current weaknesses inherent in CAR. The objective of this research is to examine the effectiveness of CAR in improving the understanding of biological concepts and to propose a model for sustainable CAR. A systematic review method following the PRISMA approach was employed to analyze relevant studies. The findings reveal that CAR is effective across almost all Biology teaching methods, enhancing quality through student participation, creativity, and learning outcomes. However, the principal challenge lies in the unsustainable nature of CAR, which hampers long-term improvement efforts. This study develops a sustainable CAR design, referred to as Sustainable Action Research (SAR), which encompasses comprehensive planning, monitored implementation, evaluation of outcomes and processes, and reflective practices to develop new strategies. SAR acts as a catalyst for the renewal of Biology teaching methods, enabling educators to adapt to evolving educational challenges. Recommendations for future research include focusing on the implementation of SAR and evaluating its effectiveness. Active teacher involvement in every stage of SAR is essential to ensure that innovations are aligned with on-the-ground needs. Collaboration between academics and teachers is also crucial to improving the quality of education in Indonesia, particularly in the field of Biology education Keywords: classroom action research, sustainable action research, biology education, sustainable education",2024.0,2024-08-26,1,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001e850d2e5e2b9e4cffa85353fb6906499e798

Results points that professors consider ICT as a factor to increase their self-efficiency, their work in teams and their autonomy, having enough technological equipment to accomplish their work activities. Results also showed that the Techno- anxiety is the factor that mostly influences in the Technostress. Besides, the multiple regression analysis determines the Lack of Work Techno-resources in the professors. In conclusion, this paper contributes to the knowledge of which factors, caused by the ICT, contributes to stress in higher education professors.",2019.0,,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001ea0bce912f70f751bb5d6c61409b63492977

Datos y análisis,"The abundant research work on reading habits in Spain shows a disaggregation of municipalities and cities with little geographical sample of their results. In this way, taking as a starting point the previous studies of 2007 for Extremadura carried out by the German Sanchez Ruiperez Foundation, our work intends to update and extend the data of reading habits by applying them to the contemporary geographical reality and the degree of rurality of the region. Thus, in the context of a survey focused on reading habits in Extremadura responded by 9.212 students of all educational levels (Primary, Secondary, University) during the year 2017, this study exposes and specifically analyzes the data obtained on the preferred genres according to the educational level and sex of participants. The study is completed with the data to the CDU of the public and school libraries of Extremadura. As a relevant result, the literary genres of mystery and adventure are, in general, the most demanded at all levels of education. In the Senior College, history is preferred.

Adequate knowledge about AIDS and smoking is a powerful tool for promoting positive attitudes and safe behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effect of self-care education on AIDS and smoking on the level of adolescents’ knowledge and health attitude. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This experimental study was conducted in the academic year of 2017–2018, and the participants were selected using randomized cluster sampling. These participants included 220 female students of the third grade of middle school in Isfahan (105 in the intervention group and 115 in the control group). Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire; a researcher-made questionnaire on knowledge about AIDS, knowledge about smoking, and attitudes toward smoking; and a standard questionnaire on students’ attitude toward AIDS. After completing the pretest, the intervention group performed two training sessions and completed the posttest 1 month later. One month after completing the pretest, the control group completed the posttest and did not receive an intervention. Finally, the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, statistical tests, and statistical software SPSS version 22. RESULTS: The results showed that despite the similarity between the two groups at the beginning of the study, after self-care education, the knowledge level of AIDS (P < 0.001) and attitude toward AIDS (P < 0.001) and the knowledge level of smoking (P < 0.001) and attitude toward smoking (P < 0.001) in the intervention group were significantly higher than the control group. In intragroup analysis, it was also observed that the difference between the scores before and after was only significant in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: It seems that education can promote the level of knowledge and attitude of adolescents toward AIDS.",2020.0,2020-01-30,2,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00024fe2b46303ad76b7e306ec7babfe678f2165

Prediction of students' study period can be a reference for higher education institutions in making policies for the future. Based on XYZ University data, especially in the informatics study program, many students have the different generation and concentration therein. In the implementation of students in studying, several factors, including the value of the Grade Point Average (GPA), can affect the study period taken. Likewise, the institutions often do not understand the conditions or predictive value of students' study period on campus.

This study assesses heterogeneity in joint trajectories of somatic disease, functional status, cognitive performance, and depressive symptomatology. Methods We analyzed 16 years of longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, 1998-2016) for n = 11,565 older adults (≥65 years) in the United States. Group-based mixture modeling identified latent clusters of older adults following similar joint trajectories across domains. Results We identified four distinct multidimensional trajectory groups: (1) Minimal Impairment with Low Multimorbidity (32.7% of the sample; mean = 0.60 conditions at age 65, 2.1 conditions at age 90) had limited deterioration; (2) Minimal Impairment with High Multimorbidity (32.9%; mean = 2.3 conditions at age 65, 4.0 at age 90) had minimal deterioration; (3) Multidomain Impairment with Intermediate Multimorbidity (19.9%; mean = 1.3 conditions at age 65, 2.7 at age 90) had moderate depressive symptomatology and functional impariments with worsening cognitive performance; (4) Multidomain Impairment with High Multimorbidity (14.1%; mean = 3.3 conditions at age 65; 4.7 at age 90) had substantial functional limitation and high depressive symptomatology with worsening cognitive performance. Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower wealth, lower education, male sex, and smoking history were significantly associated with membership in the two Multidomain Impairment classes.

One of the most widely utilized tools for measuring the educational environment is Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM). The objective of the study was to assess the attitude toward study environment, as measured using DREEM questionnaire, and to find out the differences in perception of various batches of dental students. Materials and Methods: All Bachelor of Dental Surgery students from Government Dental College, Kottayam, Kerala, India, were included in the study. They were given the well-established DREEM questionnaire. A total of 234 students took part in the study, belonging to 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 batches. DREEM subcategories were analyzed for significance using analysis of variance. The significance of DREEM score across the different batches was further analyzed using post hoc test. Results: Overall, DREEM score was positive (111.14), but there is need for improvement. Individual questions also were given positive score for most questions. The maximum score was obtained for 3rd year students. Similar results are obtained for three of the five subcategories of DREEM. Conclusion: The total DREEM score was positive (111.14).

10.7546/psyrb.2023.01.04,RISK-TAKING PROPENSITY AND EMIGRATION DECISION-MAKING: A QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS,". Risk-taking plays an important role for the psychological prediction of decision-making processes in a situation of uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to examine in-depth the association between risk-taking propensity as a personality tendency and emigration decision-making of young people. Although the correlation between risk-taking propensity and migration potential has been studied in some countries, it has not been examined to date in Bulgaria – an economy in transition. Furthermore, it was scrutinized neither in view of different risk domains (social, financial, health, ethical) nor in terms of desire, plan and preparation to move abroad as key aspects of the emigration decision-making process. The methods of in-depth calendar interviewing and qualitative data analysis were employed. Semi-structured calendar interviews (N=45) were carried out in June - November 2020 among young Bulgarian men (N=21) and women (N=24) aged 18-35 years from large, middle and small towns/villages in Bulgaria. The findings showed a positive association of risk-taking propensity and (e)migration decision-making. Respondents, identified as risk-seekers, were more likely to emigrate, compared to risk-avoiders. Social and financial domains of risk-taking turned out most closely associated with emigration decision-making. Young people, who were more willing to move away from their family, social surrounding and cultural environment, to improve their social-economic standing (education, income, career), were more positive about emigration and more likely to plan and prepare for relocation. The findings have some important interdisciplinary implications both for psychological theory and for demographic policy.",2023.0,2023-06-21,0,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000405d087e9c523d4f26466bbc45f0835aca95e

Alcohol increases aggression and impulsivity, which are strongly related to suicidal behavior. Sociocultural factors influence both alcohol use and suicide rates. Studies, conducted in one population, are not applicable to other and the results cannot be generalized. Aims: The aim was to study the putative role of alcohol in suicide cases in the rural Indian population by analysis of various sociodemographic variables. Settings and Design: This was a cross-sectional study in conducted in a tertiary medical college. Materials and Methods: Two hundred consecutive patients who survived a suicide attempt were evaluated by a psychiatrist. The data were recorded for sociodemographic variables, psychiatric disorders, suicide intent, lethality of the suicide attempt, and history of alcohol intake prior to the suicide attempt. Using alcohol intake prior to the suicide attempt as a determining dimension, various sociodemographic variables were analyzed for their statistical significance and the role of alcohol in suicide cases was assessed. Results: Seventeen percent suicide attempt survivors had a history of alcohol intake prior to the suicide attempt. Fifteen percent had a history of alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use affected the suicide rate in the male population in the late twenties to mid-thirties age group, illiterate and people with high school education, semiskilled workers, shop owners, and student population. Alcohol dependence, bipolar II disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and dysthymic disorder had higher rate of suicide attempt with the use of alcohol prior to the suicide attempt. Alcohol users attempted a more lethal suicide attempt and were found to have problems with primary support group and occupational problem as precipitating stressor for suicide attempt. Conclusions: Alcohol use increases the suicide rate, in the specific rural Indian population.",2012.0,2012-10-01,10,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000422d8664c1cb1d15379faefb82215d84b0ef2

We therefore conducted the DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) JAPAN study in an attempt to identify specific patient- and physician-related factors which contribute to delay of insulin initiation among Japanese patients with diabetes. In this report, we explored barriers for physicians which prevent timely insulin initiation. Methods The DAWN JAPAN study is a multicenter, questionnaire-based survey, conducted between 2004 and 2005. Participating physicians were categorized as follows based on their expertise: Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) certified specialists (n = 77), JDS-affiliated physicians (n = 30), and non-JDS-affiliated physicians (n = 27). To assess physician barriers to insulin initiation, we have used a newly developed 27- item questionnaire. Results The mean age of patients (n = 11,656) treated by participating physicians was 64.1 years. The mean duration of diabetes was 121.6 months, and their mean HbA1c was 7.5%. Insulin was used in 27.4% of total patients. With regard to physician barriers to insulin initiation, the biggest differences in concerns expressed by JDS-certified specialists and non-JDS-affiliated physicians were observed in the following items with statistical significance: “I do not have staff (nurse, pharmacists) who can assist with explanations” (1.3% vs 55.5%, respectively), “I have concerns about the use of insulin therapy in elderly patients” (38.1% vs 81.5%), and “It is difficult to provide guidance and education on insulin injection to patients” (16.9% vs 55.5%). The mean HbA1c at which physicians responded they would recommend insulin to their patients was 8.7%; however, they would reduce this level to 8.2% if they themselves required insulin.

All AGYW aged 15–24 were invited to participate following receipt of FP services. Adolescent girls and young women initiating or refilling contraception were included in this analysis. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) included intrauterine devices, implants, or injectables. Non-LARC methods included oral contraceptive pills (OCP) or condoms. We used an empiric risk score to assess HIV risk behaviors; HIV risk scores of ≥5 (corresponding to 5–15% HIV incidence) defined “high” HIV risk. Results: Overall, 555 AGYW seeking FP were included. Median age was 22 years [interquartile range (IQR) 20–23], median completed education was 12 years (IQR 10–12); 23% of AGYW had HIV risk scores of ≥5. The most frequent form of contraception was injectables (43%), followed by implants (39%). After adjustment for education, prior pregnancy, and marital status, LARC users more frequently engaged in transactional sex than non-LARC users [6 vs. 0%, adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.17, 95% CI 1.09–1.29, p < 0.001]; LARC use was not associated with HIV risk scores ≥5. Among LARC users, AGYW using injectables more frequently had condomless sex compared to AGYW using other LARC methods (85 vs. 75%, adjusted PR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.09–2.10, p = 0.012); injectable use was not associated with HIV risk scores ≥5. Conclusions: Adolescent girls and young women seeking contraception frequently had high HIV risk, emphasizing the importance of integrating HIV prevention within FP. Multipurpose technologies for contraception and HIV prevention could particularly benefit AGYW.",2021.0,2021-07-21,2,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004de686419ba8a382ba5690db6c03a6785479c

10.4236/HEALTH.2019.111011,"Social Dynamics of Ebola Virus Disease: A Case of Bundibugyo District, Uganda","Background: Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) presents with a high global mortality and is known to be a highly infectious disease with devastating and gendered effects on the social fabric, yet most of the science has focused on the disease’s biology. However, little has been documented with regard to the gender and social aspects of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in two sub counties (Kikyo and Bundibugyo Town Council) in Bundibugyo District in Western Uganda. The study was set to examine the gender differences in the level of knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about EVD. Methods: The study employed a cross-sectional design using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. A structured questionnaire was administered to 254 respondents, 50% of whom were women. Simple random sampling was used to select the participants. Questionnaire data were analysed using SPSS at univariate and bivariate levels. Qualitative methods such as key informant interviews (with 6 participants) and Focus Group Discussions (three, one with men alone, another with women alone and the last one with both men and women) were also used to collect additional information from participants. Results: The findings indicated that socio-demographically, the majority (35%) of the respondents were aged between 20 and 29 years, 53% of whom were females. More women (about 56%) compared to men (44%) attained secondary education while more men (about 51% versus 49% of the women) reported that they were married. In terms of religion, the majority of the survey participants were Catholics (59% females and 49% males). With regard to communities’ knowledge about EVD, there was no significant relationship between men and women in terms of prior knowledge about EVD, risk factors and control measures. However, slightly more males (about 51%) than females (49%) had heard about EVD and more males (about 52%) than females (48%) admitted that they were at risk of contracting the disease. On the control measures, slightly more females than males (about 53% vs. 47% respectively) proposed avoiding contact with infected persons. The results further revealed that more males (about 51%) than females (49%) were willing to relate with EVD survivors, and this was due to the latter’s fear of contracting the disease. The major devastating effects of EVD that were reported included loss of lives, disruption of peoples movements, isolation of people, disruption of children’s school activities, stigma and discrimination of survivors. More females (about 52%) than males (about 48%) reported that EVD survivors were discriminated during the EVD outbreak in Bundibugyo District. Conclusions: This study has shown that whereas both men and women demonstrate average knowledge about EVD, there is need for more training and sensitization targeting women who have delusions about the severity of the disease, its risk factors, stigma and the integration of survivors in the affected communities. Communities also need to be sensitized about the gender roles that increase both the burden of EVD and the risk of men and women contracting the disease. This will lead to more culturally sensitive responses to EVD outbreaks in future.",2019.0,2019-01-30,6,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000509458a49add0fc5931ec0f160d461d28817b

Method: Study cohort of 1080 subjects aged 31–40 years (528 men, 552 women) was clinically examined and interviewed in 1985 and followed for mortality until 2015. Subjects were classified into two groups: “tobacco users” and “non-users”. Associations between periodontal health parameters, tobacco products, education level and age of death were analysed. SPSS was used for analyses. Results: Tobacco products, as well as education level associated, with poor periodontal health. Tobacco users and lower education was linked to higher plaque-, calculus- and gingival-index scores than non-users (p < 0.001). They also had significantly higher prevalence of deep periodontal pockets (≥5 mm) (p < 0.001 and 0.010, respectively), missing teeth (p = 0.010 and 0.003, respectively) and lower education level (p < 0.001) compared with non-users.

10.1093/ofid/ofz360.1708,"2028. A Survey of Antimicrobial Availability, Training, and Antimicrobial Recommendations by Staff in Pharmacies and Non-pharmacy Stores in the Dominican Republic","Abstract Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a rising global health challenge. Antimicrobial use (AU) is a key factor in the development of AMR, but knowledge gaps remain on AU and dispensation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). AU can be purchased without prescriptions in many LMICs and are available in pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores. We seek to describe the availability, training and AU recommendations in pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores in the Dominican Republic (DR). Methods We conducted a survey of pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores that dispense antimicrobials from March to April 2019 in randomly selected locations throughout metropolitan Santo Domingo. Data on the availability of antimicrobials and training on AU was obtained. Antimicrobial of choice for common symptoms such as dysuria, throat pain, diarrhea, fever, and cough were queried, and data tabulated. Availability of antimicrobials by phone and online delivery was assessed. Results A total of 35 stores were surveyed. Ten pharmacies and 15 nonpharmacy stores agreed to participate. Ten refused and were excluded. Fifty AU recommendations were given in pharmacies and 16 in non-pharmacy stores. The most common type of antimicrobial recommended were aminopenicillins (Figure 1). Staff received prior training on antimicrobials in 70% of pharmacies and 0% of non-pharmacy stores. Antimicrobial recommendations by symptom in pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores are seen in Figure 2 and 3. Antimicrobials are available for phone delivery in 100% of pharmacies and 90% of non-pharmacy stores. No antimicrobials were available via online delivery apps. Conclusion Antimicrobials are widely available in the DR without prescriptions and can be purchased in person or via phone delivery. Aminopenicillins are commonly prescribed and may contribute to high rates of ESBL in the DR. Pharmacy staff gave more specific symptom-based recommendations than non-pharmacy staff and commonly had prior training on antibiotic use. In LMICs with easy access to antimicrobials, frontline staff in pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores are gatekeepers for AU and may benefit from further education and training. Further studies on attitudes and perceptions related to antimicrobial use in the community are needed.

We collected data of self-reported vaccine use from the Korean Community Health Survey. We also collected information on socioeconomic status and health behaviors in subpopulations. We tested for linear trends among the data to investigate vaccine coverage before and after the pandemic; and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of obtaining the influenza vaccination. The results revealed a steady increase in vaccination coverage in every subgroup during four consecutive seasons. The highest rate of vaccine coverage (43.6%) occurred two years after the pandemic. Factors associated with vaccine receipt were: older age; lower education level; lower income; and health behaviors such as regular walking and receiving a health check-up. Smoking and drinking alcohol were inversely associated with vaccination. Having a chronic health condition was also a strong predictor of vaccine receipt. Though vaccination coverage rates were high in high-risk groups; disparities in coverage rates were substantial; particularly in young adults. Interventions are needed to minimize the coverage gaps among subgroups and to improve overall vaccination rates.",2014.0,2014-11-25,29,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00061776bf3e06edcb47434199d6299ab3816cfe

10.1177/2051415820954738,Optimising the management of bladder pain syndrome,"Objective: Clinicians have shown variable practice in the diagnosis and management of bladder pain syndrome (BPS). This study assessed pain localisation sites, common co-morbidities, investigations and treatment patterns in clinical practice. Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 412 patients attending our pelvic pain clinic between 2004 and 2016. Frequency counts were used to summarise findings. Results: Pain in women (N=388) was localised to the lower abdomen (92.0%), lower back (71.1%) and vagina (60.8%). Men (N=24) typically presented with testicular pain with painful ejaculation (70.8%). Nearly all (95.4%) patients reported sexual dysfunction. Visceral neuropathic pain and autoimmune co-morbidities, such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic headaches or migraines and skin lesions, were more prevalent in our cohort than in the general population. All patients had urine culture and sensitivities and flexible cystoscopy. Laparoscopy, urodynamic studies and bladder biopsies were mostly normal, but were essential in excluding other pathologies. Good pain control was achieved on amitriptyline (83.0%). Hydro-distension and benign bladder ulcer cauterisation provided temporary symptomatic relief. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that patient expectation management and education is essential in BPS, with most achieving good pain control with conservative measures and amitriptyline. Those receiving intravesical treatments will most likely require subsequent revisions.

10.1289/EHP.114-A85,Effects of Lead on IQ in Children,"Lanphear et al. (2005) pooled data from seven prospective studies that had been initiated to test the effect of prenatal and early childhood lead exposure. The primary investigators of these studies had planned the studies so that the sequence of data collection might shed light on the question of early causation. At that time, most of us anticipated a strong association of prenatal exposure and developmental deficit related to rapid prenatal central nervous system (CNS) development (Ernhart 1992). Lanphear et al. (2005) pooled our data to report a significant association of cord blood lead (BPb) and IQ (intelligence quotient) and concluded that prevention of lead exposure must occur before pregnancy or childbirth. Their analysis did not include control of the sociodemographic factors known to confound research on the topic; hence, the conclusion is not justified. 
 
In the balance of the report, Lanphear et al. (2005) selected concurrent lead level at 5–6 years of age, as opposed to earlier measures of lead exposure, because it had the highest association with IQ. The closer association for the lead measurement made at or near the time of the IQ test may reflect concomitant factors not well controlled in the analyses. In most studies, parental intelligence and HOME (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment; a measure of caretaking and parental stimulation) are major predictors of child IQ. These variables are difficult to measure (Kaufman 2001), and undercontrol of confounding is likely. Bias is particularly likely in the data of the Rochester, New York, cohort (Canfield et al. 2003) because the HOME (toddler version) was administered at the age of 2 years, not at 5–6 years of age. 
 
Using available covariate data, Lanphear et al. (2005) did report a deficit of approximately 2 IQ points for the BPb range of 10–20 μg/dL. This replicates previous analyses conducted by Pocock et al. (1994). The latter investigators interpreted the association as possibly due to limited control of confounding, selection biases, and/or reverse causality. 
 
The most problematic portion of the article by Lanphear et al. (2005) concerns very low lead exposure. The authors selected data for the 244 children who had peak, or maximal, BPb levels < 10 μg/dL. The decline in IQ for this group consisted of 6.2 points for the concurrent BPb range of 1–10 μg/dL (β = −0.80, SE = 0.48, p = 0.09). For a more restricted group of 103 children with peak BPb levels < 7.5 μg/dL, the association was stronger (β = −2.94, SE = 1.14, p = 0.012) although the sample size was further truncated. Lanphear et al. (2005) concluded that “lead exposure in children who have maximal BPb levels < 7.5 μg/dL is associated with intellectual deficits.” There are major problems with this conclusion. 
 
First, groups selected on the basis of peak lead level < 10 μg/dL and < 7.5 μg/dL differed significantly from the balance of the sample on factors omitted as non-contributing for the full study. Lanphear et al. (2005) ignored race (U.S. cohorts), maternal age, and maternal use of cigarettes and alcohol during pregnancy in the analyses of these groups. 
 
Second, cohort contribution was critical for these groups. Of the 103 children with BPb levels < 7.5 μg/dL (Lanphear et al 2005), 67% were from the Rochester cohort. In addition to the limitation in the HOME data, information regarding this cohort at 3 and 5 years of age reflects peculiar shifts in demographic variables, including race and maternal education (Canfield et al. 2003; Canfield RL, Henderson CR, Lanphear BP, Cory-Schlecta DA, Smith EG, Cox C, unpublished data). This was a prospective study, yet the sample increased from 154 children at 5 years of age to 182 at 6 years of age, and the number with peak lead levels < 10 μg/dL increased from 86 to 103. Canfield et al.’s 6-year data used in the pooled analysis have not been published, and my requests for further information were denied. 
 
Finally, there was no significant association of IQ and three of the four indices of lead exposure—early childhood, peak (or maximal), and lifetime average—for the segments of the sample with peak lead levels < 10 μg/dL or < 7.5 μg/dL. Lanphear et al. (2005) omitted these analyses from their article. 
 
Lanphear et al. (2005) reached conclusions intended to support policies to further reduce the already low level of childhood lead exposure. Although I contributed data [the Cleveland Study (Ernhart et al. 1989)] and participated in planning and review of analyses, I withdrew from authorship because I could not concur with the manuscript, including the inferences drawn.",2006.0,2006-02-01,565,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00068be602c76a2f2c8e14fc9fa34b0138657644
10.11604/pamj.2014.17.4.2475,An evaluation of the 2012 measles mass vaccination campaign in Guinea,"Introduction To estimate the post-campaign level of measles vaccination coverage in Guinea. Methods Interview of parents and observation of measles vaccination cards of children aged 9 to 59 months during the mass measles campaign. A nationwide cluster randomized sample under health District stratification. Results 64.2% (95%CI = 60.9% to 67.4%) of children were vaccinated and had their measles vaccination card. With respect to card and history 90.5% (95%CI = 88.3% to 92.3%) were vaccinated. The estimation was found to be between 72.7% and 81.9%. Coverage with card increased from 55.5% to 79.30% with the level of education of parents but that was not statistically significant, (X2(trend) =3.087 P= 0.07). However coverage with card significantly increased with profession from 55.1% for farmers followed by 59.2% for other manual workers to 73.8% for sellers, ending by 74.5% for settled technicians (X2 (trend) =12.16 P= 0.0005). For unvaccinated children, lack of information accounted for the main reason (37.03%) followed by parents’ occupation (23.45%), parents’ sickness (8.6%), children's sickness (4.9%) and others including vaccinators absent in the post or parents’ belief that it was a door to door campaign. Conclusion The mass measles vaccination campaign achieved an approximate coverage of 75%. Although not enough for effective control of measles, it has covered an important gap left over by the routine immunization coverage 42%. Appropriate measures are needed to improve coverage in routine immunization and specific actions should be taken to target farmers and other manual workers’ families but also uneducated groups for both routine immunization and mass campaigns.",2014.0,2014-01-08,9,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0006b7d69b384222258abb443ac7b974bc55862f

10.32734/INJAR.V4I1.5353,"Analysis of Technical Efficiency of USAID-MARKETS II Project Participant and Non-Participant Rice Farming Households in Ebonyi State, Nigeria","Low level production efficiency of the Nigerian farmers have continued to be a major problem towards food security in Nigeria. The study examined the technical efficiency of USAID-MARKETS II project participant and non-participant rice farming households in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling procedure was employed to select 491 rice farming households which comprise 239 participants, and 252 non- participants. Primary source of data were collected with the use of a structured interview questionnaire and field participation. Data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, and percentage, Z statistic, and stochastic frontier Model. The result from the study, reveals that the USAID-MARKETS II project participants were 92% technical efficient while USAID-MARKETS II project non-participants were 91% technical efficient. The result further reveals that a significant difference exist between the participants’ technical efficiency and that of non-participants of USAID-MARKETS II project. Household size and education were the vital factors that improved technical efficiency of the rice farmers. Therefore, Ebonyi rice farmers should be adequately trained on modern rice production techniques by the government agency, Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) and non-governmental agencies. Also, adequate extension services should be provided to the farmers by the ADP for proper information dissemination.",2021.0,2021-04-20,0,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00072a63fe0c0a74879ebe8e8ab9dea428f8bc31

10.17795/ijpbs-2256,"Child Abuse and Neglect Epidemiology in Secondary School Students of Yazd Province, Iran","Background: Child abuse is an issue that has many physical and psychological consequences. Objectives: This study was designed and conducted to investigate the current situation regarding child abuse, which can be used as a guideline for planning future interventions. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive, analytic cross-sectional study on 700 Yazd secondary school students in 2013, using a standardized self-administered questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using the SPSS v.19 software and appropriate statistical tests and logistic regression analysis. P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Overall, 700 students (43%) were boys. Child abuse frequency was 93.5% (92.2% of boys and 94.4% of girls). The most common domains of child abuse among all students were neglect (83.8%), psychological (76.1%), physical (36.1%) and sexual (28.8 %), respectively. The most common domains of child abuse among female students were neglect (84.9%), psychological (82.3%), physical (32.5%) and sexual (31.5 %), and among male students, these were neglect (82.3%), psychological (67.9%), physical (41%) and sexual (25.3%). Demographic variables included substance abuse of parents, father’s education, parents living status and having other jobs, which were significantly related variables to child abuse and neglect (P value < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study is the first investigation performed on patients with LCH and its possible association with EBV in Iran. Considering the P = 0.004, which is statistically significant, the findings do support the hypothesis of a possible role for EBV in the pathogenesis of LCH.

10.26803/ijlter.21.2.6,Entry Requirements as Predictors of the Academic Performance of Postgraduate Students in Universities in Zimbabwe,"One of the major strategies that universities use to ensure quality in education is the use of entry requirements as a screening procedure to ensure that only those considered to be the ‘best’ students are admitted. Whether these so-called ‘best’ students eventually perform to expectations academically is an issue on which conclusive evidence does not exist. Also, recruiting students with high entry requirements is viewed in universities as a confidence-building exercise with regard to the quality of graduates churned out by educational institutions. This study, therefore, examined whether a significant relationship exists between entry requirements and the academic performance of postgraduate students admitted into universities in Zimbabwe based on different entry qualifications. The study used a descriptive research design that employed a quantitative approach located in the post-positivist paradigm. A sample of 110 Master of Education in Mathematics (M.EdMT) students admitted into the programme based on the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) and the Bachelor of Science Education (BScEd) degrees was randomly selected from a population of 200 M.EdMT students from four universities in Zimbabwe. The t-test and ANOVA were used to analyse the data. The study revealed that degree classifications at the undergraduate level had no significant influence on the academic performance of postgraduate students. It was also concluded that there were no significant differences in the academic performance of students admitted into the M.EdMT programme based on the B.Ed. and BScEd degrees.",2022.0,2022-02-28,0,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00083112399e055d6d27f61b63ff8e8690d66ee1

The influence of values on membership in voluntary organizations in midlife and old age,"Membership in voluntary organizations is associated with individual and social benefits. Due to the negative consequences of the global pandemic on older people, and the governmental challenges posed by population aging, voluntary membership is of great importance to society. To effectively promote volunteering among older people, it is necessary to understand the determinants of voluntary membership. This study analyses the influence of individual values—secular/traditional and survival/self-expression–on voluntary membership among European adults (N = 31,985). Specifically, it examines which values orient two age groups (middle age: 50–64 and old age: 65–79), as well as men and women toward a certain type of association (Social Awareness; Professional and Political; Education and Leisure; Religion). The sample of 31,985 comprises 60% of adults aged 50–64 and 40% aged 65–79; of which 56% are women and 44% men. The empirical estimation considers different levels of data aggregation: individual, national and welfare system, therefore multilevel analysis is used as an analytical strategy. Individual-level variables from the Integrated Values Survey (2005/09, 2010/14, and 2017/20) and national-level variables (Gini Index and Gross Domestic Product Per Capita) from the World Bank and Eurostat are used. The results indicate that traditional and self-expression values promote membership in voluntary organizations in general more than secular and survival values. However, there are differences according to the type of organization. Furthermore, values are found to moderate the effect of age and gender on voluntary membership.",2022.0,2022-08-23,1,105,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0008d41b76751858666ff4525eb3218e1e4f301e

Totally, 558 medical personnel working at 12 general hospitals in Gwangju and Jeollanamdo were enrolled in the survey conducted from June 28 to July 15, 2022. Data were analyzed by applying a t-test, variance analysis, post-test, and correlations and phase regression test. When considering patient safety education, patient safety education for medical personnel, and job performance, results were statistically significant for age, education, bed quantity, job category, wage level, satisfaction, location, health status, health control education experience, and chronic disease. Furthermore, age, bed quantity, satisfaction, location, health status, health control education experience, chronic disease, and depression experience were statistically significant for job performance. Correlations were obtained between patient safety education and job performance, whereas learning transfer results were affected by age, bed quantity, satisfaction, health-related education experience, chronic disease, and depression experience. Considering the results, we suggest the enhancement and repetitive provision of patient safety education programs for medical personnel. Moreover, the organizational education culture and education atmosphere need to be developed to encourage job performance.

10.37128/2411-4413-2019-4-19,FEATURES OF USING CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES IN EDUCATION,"The article investigates cloud technologies and features of their use in educational institutions.

The essence of cloud technologies in education is determined. It is noted that the modern institution of higher education provides usage of information and communication technologies, and in particular, cloud technologies. The main characteristics (features) which characterize cloud services are described here. It is noted that usage of cloud services has benefits and problems as well.

There are such mandatory characteristics of cloud computing as self-service on demand, universal access to the network, resource pooling, elasticity, consumption accounting.

Four models of deployment of cloud technologies are revealed in the article. They are corporate, public, group and hybrid. It is admitted that the most appropriate model of deployment of cloud technologies in the infrastructure of higher education institutions is hybrid.

Cloud technologies support such activities as: communication, collaboration and co-operation, which determines certain areas of their usage.

The architecture of cloud technologies is presented in three levels: software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

The most popular cloud services which are used in various spheres, including educational institutions, are analyzed here. Office 365, Microsoft Planner, Microsoft SkyDrive, Google Drive, Google Talk, Google Docs, these are the common cloud services which are selected in SaaS. Popular software platforms which are presented in the PaaS segment are Windows Azure, Google App Engine, Cloud9 IDE, Ideone IDE. Each of the cloud platforms that is described in the article has its own peculiarities.

Possible areas of application of cloud technologies in the educational process are identified. They are free access to the programs and services used in the educational process, planning activities, implementation of the working regime of teachers and employees, the organization and conduct of scientific online conferences, seminars, forums, round tables, trainings, joint project work of students, individual independent work of students, electronic interaction with entrants.",2019.0,2019-04-01,1,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00097cb0951928625addc689686a717ade3bdfae

Thus, the purpose of this systematic review is to prepare a comprehensive overview which identifies the activities of daily living (ADLs) that are gradually reduced among patients with dementia, as well as explore the therapies applied in relation to dementia and how they effectively improve the quality of life (QoL) of patients and caregivers. Furthermore, we aim to summarise the ADL activities influenced by therapies and examine the treatment costs and care for patients so that recommendations for research and development (R&D) can be made to improve both the QoL of people with dementia and cost-saving measures. The research focuses on four selected neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer, Parkinson, vascular dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, the peer-reviewed English written articles from 2014 to 2019 were searched between September 1 and December 13, 2019. Twenty-seven papers were included in the analysis. The results show that essential assistance occurs in connection with activities: eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, personal hygiene, use of the toilet, and transport. By contrast, shopping or cleaning is not addressed as much. A lower ability to take care of oneself is connected with poor patient health and higher social care costs because the patient requires care from external sources, such as home aid or nurse visits. The challenge that remains is to shift new knowledge from scientific disciplines and connect it with the needs of patients to remove legitimate barriers and increase the acceptance of new solutions by popularisation. Additionally, regarding the burden on caregivers, it would be appropriate to promote this area of education and employment so that family members can use formal caregivers, ensuring them free time and much-needed rest.",2020.0,2020-10-01,44,101,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0009ebd6d011e026b7bc402274823e8584146c13

10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014120,Understanding repeated non-attendance in health services: a pilot analysis of administrative data and full study protocol for a national retrospective cohort,"Introduction Understanding the causes of low engagement in healthcare is a pre-requisite for improving health services’ contribution to tackling health inequalities. Low engagement includes missing healthcare appointments. Serially (having a pattern of) missing general practice (GP) appointments may provide a risk marker for vulnerability and poorer health outcomes. Methods and analysis A proof of concept pilot using GP appointment data and a focus group with GPs informed the development of missed appointment categories: patients can be classified based on the number of appointments missed each year. The full study, using a retrospective cohort design, will link routine health service and education data to determine the relationship between GP appointment attendance, health outcomes, healthcare usage, preventive health activity and social circumstances taking a life course approach and using data from the whole journey in the National Health Service (NHS) healthcare. 172 practices will be recruited (∼900 000 patients) across Scotland. The statistical analysis will focus on 2 key areas: factors that predict patients who serially miss appointments, and serial missed appointments as a predictor of future patient outcomes. Regression models will help understand how missed appointment patterns are associated with patient and practice characteristics. We shall identify key factors associated with serial missed appointments and potential interactions that might predict them. Ethics and dissemination The results of the project will inform debates concerning how best to reduce non-attendance and increase patient engagement within healthcare systems. Significant non-academic beneficiaries include governments, policymakers and medical practitioners. Results will be disseminated via a combination of academic outputs (papers, conferences), social media and through collaborative public health/policy fora.",2017.0,2017-02-01,50,41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a492040ce96c121ad662c06a635bee537c7c2

A multi-stage random sampling method was used to extract 3352 effective samples of the rural elderly in Anhui, including 1206 poor and 2146 non-poor elderly subjects. Euro QoL 5-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) was used for the measurement of QoL. Descriptive statistics and χ2 test were used to compare and analyze the sociodemographic characteristics and QoL scores between poor and non-poor elderly. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the influencing factors of QoL. There were significant differences in gender, age, education levels, professions, chronic diseases, physical discomfort within 2 weeks, hospitalization within 1 year, economic sources, and migrant workers between the rural poor and non-poor elderly groups. The QoL of rural poor elderly scored significantly higher than the non-poor elderly, in all these five dimensions. The average EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) of poor elderly was 65.689, lower than the non-poor elderly (71.039). After controlling the confounding factors, there was a significant statistical difference in the total utility score of EQ-5D between the poor and non-poor elderly groups. The QoL of poor elderly in central China is lower than non-poor elderly, with the worst dimension of pain/discomfort. The QoL of rural poor elderly in this area could be affected by many factors, to which more attention should be paid.",2020.0,2020-02-01,5,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a73d9ce891b5ce524d3a0417f96d15d68e361

Methods Cross-sectional study of the entire population resident in Catalonia in 2015 (7.5 million people) using administrative records. Twenty indicators are analysed related to health, the use of healthcare services and consumption of prescription drugs. Rates, frequencies and averages are obtained for the different variables stratified by age groups (under 15 years, 15–64 years and 65 years or older), gender and socioeconomic status (calculated on the basis of pharmacy copayment levels and Social Security benefits received). Results A socioeconomic gradient was observed in all the indicators analysed, in both sexes and in all age groups. Morbidity, use of mental healthcare centres, hospitalisation rates and probability of drug consumption among children is 3–7 times higher for those with low socioeconomic level respect to those with a higher one. In children and adults, the steepest gradient was found in the use of mental health services. Moreover, there are gender inequalities. Conclusion There are significant socioeconomic inequalities in health status and in the use of healthcare services in the population of Catalonia. To respond to this situation, new policies on health and other areas, such as education and employment, are required, especially those that have an impact on early years.",2018.0,2018-08-06,50,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a865700d48b951da8a36df0d1c11d7e0d88c5

Since then, as part of Polio Endgame Strategy, high-quality national and sub-national polio rounds are being conducted to maintain herd immunity through each year. With years of no fresh cases of polio, several sections in the community have raised doubts over the continuation of the Intensified Pulse Polio Immunization (IPPI) program in postcertification era. Thus, this study with mixed method approach was aimed at assessing the community perceptions toward IPPI using quantitative approach and stakeholder's perception using qualitative approach in a high-risk area of Kolkata. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 2 months from March to April 2018 in Southern part of Kolkata which involved surveying 104 randomly selected households followed by key informant interviews with community influencers. Pearson's Chi-square test was performed to determine the association between categorical variables. SPSS v. 16.0 software was used for analysis. Results: Inadequate knowledge (32%) and unfavorable attitude (45%) regarding IPPI were observed among the interviewed respondents. Safety concern (5.7%), spouse/elderly pressure (4.8%), and sterility issues (1.9%) were identified as prominent barriers resulting in hesitancy (16.2%) during IPPI. Statistically significant association of respondent's attitude was observed between gender, religion, and education. Conclusion: Social behavior change communication involving community and community influencers would help to overcome the barriers to IPPI coverage and thus to mitigate the risk of re-emergence of polio in future.",2019.0,,1,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a97daa4c47d2624a573c9896d1393d0787f6f

Diet and nutrition are fundamental to the prevention and management of chronic diseases. Systemic health can impact oral health. And oral health can influence diet and nutrition. The 2020 Surgeon General’s Report “Oral Health in America” stated that nutrition is an integral factor in the development of oral disease and health overall. Within the medical model, Registered Dietitians have been impactful members of a multidisciplinary team by providing medical nutrition therapy and nutritional counseling to reduce the development and management of chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Despite the well-established collaboration and the role nutrition plays in health outcomes, there is limited documented collaboration between nutrition and dentistry. The purpose of this paper is to review the current evidence of nutritional counseling in oral health settings compared to the medical model, identify specific challenges, and suggest possible next steps for collaboration. The intended outcome of this paper will be to provide the reader with insight about the need to integrate nutrition into both oral health education and clinical practice to address prevalent chronic diseases and increase health equity for those at high risk.",2025.0,2025-02-26,0,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b1d5259a5b60729a3b437c386bee3c5fa4a01
10.12688/f1000research.159120.1,Consequences of antibiotic overuse in Saudi Arabia: a multidimensional analysis,"Background Antibiotic overuse is a significant public health challenge in Saudi Arabia, contributing to the global rise of antibiotic resistance. This study investigates demographic factors, awareness levels, and perceptions influencing the misuse of antibiotics in the Saudi population. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among individuals aged 18 and above, recruited through random sampling across Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a validated online questionnaire assessing antibiotic use behaviors, awareness of antibiotic resistance, and perceptions of associated risks. Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and logistic regression, identified predictors of antibiotic misuse. Results Among the 525 participants, 86.1% were aware of antibiotic resistance, yet 59.05% mistakenly believed antibiotics are effective against viral infections. Antibiotic misuse was prevalent, with 86.1% admitting to use without a prescription and 81.9% stopping antibiotics prematurely. Younger age (18–29 years; OR = 2.35, p < 0.001) and lower education levels (high school or below; OR = 1.78, p = 0.015) were significant predictors of misuse. Public awareness campaigns and stricter regulations were supported by 86.1% and 85.9% of respondents, respectively. Conclusions Antibiotic misuse in Saudi Arabia is influenced by demographic factors, insufficient awareness, and misconceptions about antibiotic resistance. Targeted educational programs, robust public health campaigns, and regulatory enforcement are critical to addressing this issue. Leveraging digital health technologies offers a promising avenue to promote responsible antibiotic use and mitigate the threat of resistance.",2025.0,2025-01-27,0,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000b20fa8752b1d593be0390463041c22adea75f

METHODS We used data from 9,130 participants from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) baseline survey. The outcome variable was receipt of pensions from any source. The exploratory variables were age, gender, residence by region and by urban/rural area, household arrangements, schooling, household assets, perception of income sufficiency, age when started working, number of chronic diseases, and functional limitation. The analyses were based on the Poisson and binary logistic regressions. RESULTS The prevalence of the receipt of pension was 54.3%. In the multivariate analysis, the following factors showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) associations with the outcome: age [Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 2.59 and 3.24 for 60–69 and 70 years], rural residence (PR = 1.23 ), residence in the Northeast, South and Southeast compared to the North (PR ranging from 1.18 to 1.23), living arrangements (PR = 1.07 and 1.15 for living with one person and living alone), perception of income sufficiency (PR = 1.08 and 1.15 for sometimes and always), functional limitation (PR = 1.13) and having 1 and ≥ 2 chronic diseases (PR = 1,09 and 1,17). Negative association was observed for 5-8 years of education. No association between age when the individual started working and the outcome was observed. Younger participants (50–59 years old) with ≥ 2 diseases or functional limitation were 31% and 63% more likely to receive pensions, respectively; the strength of these associations declined with age. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that health conditions are important determinants of early retirement.

10.29329/jirte.2024.650.1,Examining early childhood teachers' beliefs and practices about multicultural education,"Multiculturalism has become a crucial part of education in most countries and Türkiye since global migrations are constantly increasing. However, multicultural education is still being discovered by teachers and educators. Therefore, this study examined early childhood teachers’ beliefs and practices through multicultural education in Türkiye. The study was designed as a qualitative study in which multiple case studies design was utilized for investigation. All six participants were selected by purposive sampling and working with 5-6-year-old children from different countries. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews, and inductive content analysis was utilized to analyze the collected data. The findings indicated that teachers are not aware of the meaning of multiculturalism and multicultural education. Teachers were not prepared to teach culturally diverse children. In addition, they believe that instead of preparing the classroom for children with different funds of knowledge and adapting the curriculum for them multicultural children should adapt to the current educational system. Finally, teachers claimed the language barrier is the biggest issue they had to cope with, and they use online translators, older siblings going to the same school as interpreters, and body language to solve this problem.",2024.0,2024-03-18,0,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000cb986934374ffe5ba45f191a8993fdd075e5b

This study aims to analyze the strategies employed by enterprises and employee groups in employee training. Drawing on concepts from evolutionary game theory, we investigate the cooperative evolutionary strategy embraced by both parties in employee training and evaluate various contributing factors. The findings reveal the following key insights. (1) Decision‐making behavior of the enterprise and employee group is highly contingent upon their respective income growth rates. (2) The decisions made by the enterprise significantly influence the long‐term strategic choices of both parties. (3) The equilibrium strategy adopted by both parties hinges on a trade‐off analysis of cost, expense, and benefit. As these three factors progressively increase, the equilibrium strategy of both parties tends toward a (Random, Negative) approach. Conversely, the parties are more inclined toward a combination of (Stabilization, Positive) strategies when the benefits of skill dissemination augment. This study offers innovations by examining evolutionary trends in game dynamics between enterprises and employee groups during training and analyzing how various factors impact decision‐making strategies on both sides.",2024.0,2024-01-01,0,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000cd8830e56ea18ca97d9268fb1ca705737b071

10.2196/17038,Acceptability of an Embodied Conversational Agent for Type 2 Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support via a Smartphone App: Mixed Methods Study,"Background Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly used in health care apps; however, their acceptability in type 2 diabetes (T2D) self-management apps has not yet been investigated. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of the ECA (Laura) used to deliver diabetes self-management education and support in the My Diabetes Coach (MDC) app. Methods A sequential mixed methods design was applied. Adults with T2D allocated to the intervention arm of the MDC trial used the MDC app over a period of 12 months. At 6 months, they completed questions assessing their interaction with, and attitudes toward, the ECA. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subsample of the participants from the intervention arm to explore their experiences of using the ECA. The interview questions included the participants’ perceptions of Laura, including their initial impression of her (and how this changed over time), her personality, and human character. The quantitative and qualitative data were interpreted using integrated synthesis. Results Of the 93 intervention participants, 44 (47%) were women; the mean (SD) age of the participants was 55 (SD 10) years and the baseline glycated hemoglobin A1c level was 7.3% (SD 1.5%). Overall, 66 of the 93 participants (71%) provided survey responses. Of these, most described Laura as being helpful (57/66, 86%), friendly (57/66, 86%), competent (56/66, 85%), trustworthy (48/66, 73%), and likable (40/66, 61%). Some described Laura as not real (18/66, 27%), boring (26/66, 39%), and annoying (20/66, 30%). Participants reported that interacting with Laura made them feel more motivated (29/66, 44%), comfortable (24/66, 36%), confident (14/66, 21%), happy (11/66, 17%), and hopeful (8/66, 12%). Furthermore, 20% (13/66) of the participants were frustrated by their interaction with Laura, and 17% (11/66) of the participants reported that interacting with Laura made them feel guilty. A total of 4 themes emerged from the qualitative data (N=19): (1) perceived role: a friendly coach rather than a health professional; (2) perceived support: emotional and motivational support; (3) embodiment preference acceptability of a human-like character; and (4) room for improvement: need for greater congruence between Laura’s words and actions. Conclusions These findings suggest that an ECA is an acceptable means to deliver T2D self-management education and support. A human-like character providing ongoing, friendly, nonjudgmental, emotional, and motivational support is well received. Nevertheless, the ECA can be improved by increasing congruence between its verbal and nonverbal communication and accommodating user preferences.

10.1093/eurpub/ckad079,The Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire-Short Form and 2-year follow-up of registered work disability,"Abstract Background The Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (ÖMPSQ) was developed to identify psychological and functioning-related risk factors among individuals with musculoskeletal pain at risk of work disability. This study aimed to examine whether the short version of the ÖMPSQ (ÖMPSQ-SF) can be used for this purpose, using registry-based outcomes. Methods The ÖMPSQ-SF was completed by the members of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 at the age of 46 years (baseline). These data were enriched with national registers, including information on sick leaves and disability pensions (indicators of work disability). The associations between the ÖMPSQ-SF categories (low-, medium- and high risk) and work disability over a 2-year follow-up were analysed using negative binomial regression and binary logistic regression models. We made adjustments for sex, baseline education level, weight status and smoking. Results Overall, 4063 participants provided full data. Of these, 90% belonged to the low-risk, 7% to the medium-risk and 3% to the high-risk group. Compared to the low-risk group, the high-risk group had a 7.5 [Wald 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2–9.0] times higher number of sick leave days and 16.1 (95% CI 7.1–36.8) times higher odds of disability pension after adjustments in the 2-year follow-up. Conclusions : Our study suggests that the ÖMPSQ-SF could be used for predicting registry-based work disability at midlife. Those allocated to the high-risk group seemed to have a particularly great need of early interventions to support their work ability.",2023.0,2023-05-16,1,39,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d1feae4fb54531d4b7d7155cff96d0c29b53d

Data collection was conducted in 2020 using a questionnaire. The data were analysed by Pearson correlation coefficient to look for relations between variables (i.e., gender, type of higher education institution, popularity of accounting, professional interest, quality of school training, importance of competencies). Gender differences and differences between students in terms of type of institution were tested by Mann-Whitney U-test. It was found that there is a need to strengthen students' awareness of the requirements of employers in the Czech and international labour market in the field of accounting practice. Gender, type of institution and popularity of the accounting subject have an influence on the perception of the importance of competences for accounting practice. Differences were found at the level of soft skills, namely in the case of effective communication and responsibility. The findings suggest the need to strengthen practical training in terms of time allocation, involvement of experts from the field, internships, as well as the modernization of the curriculum.",2021.0,2021-10-01,4,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d48fed5f2cbbbd9c112fcb18c090f1cccaa19

The ever-changing research landscape driven by globalisation, technological advancements, and the use of new methodologies calls for globally competent researchers. Yet, little is known about research knowledge, skills and values that globally competent researchers need to engage ethically and competently in research projects and research communities across disciplines and across geographic borders. Informed by an international community of 38 scholars in Education from 17 countries of Global South and Global North, this forward-looking study provides a much-needed emerging definition for a globally competent researcher and competencies required by such a researcher. Furthermore, the preliminary findings showcase research learning opportunities and challenges associated with training globally competent researchers. As evident from the findings, more attention needs to be devoted to understanding the preparation of future researchers able to conduct quality research in the interconnected world.

The experimental approach was used to design the two equal groups, and the research community was represented in the third stage students in the College of Physical Education and Sports Sciences, the University of Kufa for the academic year 2020/2021, who numbered (85). Students and the research sample included (28) students, with (14) students for each of the control group and the experimental group. The most important results of the research indicated that the inverted learning strategy has a prominent impact in developing the most important visual abilities associated with the skill of receiving serve in volleyball for students, and following it during the implementation of the educational units has a great role in developing the skill of receiving serve and shortening the class time that the teacher spends with the learners. The recommendations were to adopt the inverted learning strategy in the educational units of volleyball, to adopt visual exercises characterized by excitement and suspense, to involve the sense of sight in the exercises, and to develop the player's sense of changing stimuli in the educational environment, such as pictures, colors, light flyers, balls, colored figures, circular rings, colored rugs, and optical techniques.",2022.0,2022-09-18,0,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000e76cb49d626f35c2eec047c4ed8d4ab27dcb9
10.3390/su14084774,Do Knowledge Economy Indicators Affect Economic Growth? Evidence from Developing Countries,"The competitiveness of national economies is increasingly dependent on their ability to produce and use knowledge, as knowledge, education, and innovation are the main indicators of economic growth in a globalizing world. Many countries have adopted policies related to the production of knowledge and its transformation into wealth that stimulates the growth and competitiveness of their economies. Through our study, we measured some knowledge economy (KE) variables for a sample of 20 developing countries. During the period (1996–2020), using panel data, the estimate was made using three models: the cumulative regression model, the fixed-effects model, and the random-effects model. The results of the statistical tests indicated that the fixed-effects model is the appropriate model, and that the estimates of the proposed model parameters do not contradict the assumptions of economic theory, nor do they contradict the practical reality. In addition, the results showed that 93% one of the changes that occur in economic growth in the developing countries under study is due to the dependence on the knowledge economy. It became clear through the study that the use of cross-sectional time-series models increases the accuracy of statistical forecasting, because it considers the information with a time dimension in the time series, as well as the cross-sectional dimension in different units. Our study found a positive impact on economic growth of the internet and mobile phone users, control of corruption, political stability, foreign direct investment, and the total value of international trade. Additionally, spending on education, patents for residents, and trade openness had a negative impact on economic growth. Accordingly, the knowledge economy in developing countries contributed greatly to their economic growth and had a prominent role in maintaining high rates of growth for decades. Our study contributes by expanding the scope of developing countries in deciding to focus on the important indicators in the knowledge economy (KE), so that they can increase the added value of their economic growth.",2022.0,2022-04-15,26,86,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000e81b9ed98d12298f8c9909074a9b7c1db91f0
10.3390/nu8020074,Iodine Status of Women of Reproductive Age in Sierra Leone and Its Association with Household Coverage with Adequately Iodized Salt,"Salt iodization programs are a public health success in tackling iodine deficiency. Yet, a large proportion of the world’s population remains at risk for iodine deficiency. In a nationally representative cross-sectional survey in Sierra Leone, household salt samples and women’s urine samples were quantitatively analyzed for iodine content. Salt was collected from 1123 households, and urine samples from 817 non-pregnant and 154 pregnant women. Household coverage with adequately iodized salt (≥15 mg/kg iodine) was 80.7%. The median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) of pregnant women was 175.8 µg/L and of non-pregnant women 190.8 µg/L. Women living in households with adequately iodized salt had higher median UIC (for pregnant women: 180.6 µg/L vs. 100.8 µg/L, respectively, p < 0.05; and for non-pregnant women: 211.3 µg/L vs. 97.8 µg/L, p < 0.001). Differences in UIC by residence, region, household wealth, and women’s education were much smaller in women living in households with adequately iodized salt than in households without. Despite the high household coverage of iodized salt in Sierra Leone, it is important to reach the 20% of households not consuming adequately iodized salt.

10.3390/en16083562,Predicting and Managing EV Charging Demand on Electrical Grids: A Simulation-Based Approach,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular, and it is important for utilities to understand their charging characteristics to accurately estimate the demand on the electrical grid. In this work, we developed simulation models for different EV charging scenarios in the home sector. We used them to predict maximum demand based on the increasing penetration of EV consumers. We comprehensively reviewed the literature on EV charging technologies, battery capacity, charging situations, and the impact of EV loads. Our results suggest a method for visualizing the impact of EV charging loads by considering factors such as state of charge, arrival time, charging duration, rate of charge, maximum charging power, and involvement rate. This method can be used to model load profiles and determine the number of chargers needed to meet EV user demand. We also explored the use of a time-of-use (TOU) tariff as a demand response strategy, which encourages EV owners to charge their vehicles off-peak in order to avoid higher demand charges. Our simulation results show the effects of various charging conditions on load profiles and indicate that the current TOU price strategy can accommodate a 20% growth in EV consumers, while the alternative TOU price strategy can handle up to a 30% penetration level.",2023.0,2023-04-20 00:00:00,13,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9357a46f47c6f2bea9761cbcd79ddab4e350d557
10.3390/app13063760,Data-Driven Model for Identifying Factors Influencing Electric Vehicle Charging Demand: A Comparative Analysis of Early- and Maturity-Phases of Electric Vehicle Programs in Korea,"With increasing concerns about urban pollution, electric vehicles (EVs) have offered an alternative mode of transportation that reduces urban pollution levels. Previous studies have sought to identify the various factors influencing EV charging patterns to deploy an appropriate charging infrastructure. However, limited attention has been paid to the investigation of different charging patterns identified in different regions at different phases of the EV program. This study aims to fill this research gap in the literature by developing binary logistic models that account for the factors influencing charging demands in different regions of Korea, i.e., Jeju-do and Gangneung-si. To this end, we collected historical data on EV charging transactions in these study regions and analyzed them to evaluate the difference in charging demands. The developed models suggest that the charging demand varies with charger characteristics and charging time. Moreover, different charging patterns in different regions can be explained by the different travel behaviors of those who use EVs for different trip purposes. These findings provide an important implication suggesting that policymakers should consider a stepwise strategy to construct charging infrastructure at the appropriate scale and configuration, depending on the phase of the EV program.",2023.0,2023-03-15 00:00:00,6,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c59c06c8a44acbda74667e76459b2df8dae90273

This study identifies user behavioral patterns by analyzing data from more than 7000 charging stations in Canada, comparing residential vs. public Level 2, and public direct current fast (DCFC) vs. public Level 2 charging. A novel algorithm, CHAODA, was applied to identify differences between DCFC and other Level 2 charging options. Through a multivariate and holistic methodology, various patterns emerge, identifying differences in the utilization and seasonality of different EVSE types. The study provides evidence of an “EV Duck Curve” that amplifies the baseline of the power production “Duck Curve,” confirming future challenges for grid stability. Implementations of this study can support future EVSE infrastructure planning efforts and help improve the overall service of electric vehicle supply equipment and grid stability.",2023.0,2023-02-05 00:00:00,34,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49e3c326f67a5916bdb617f9399b21c16f9803ad

While various governments promote EVs, people feel “range anxiety” because of their limited driving range or charge capacity. A limited number of charging stations are available, which results in a strong demand for predicting energy consumed by EVs. In this paper, machine learning (ML) models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to investigate the total energy consumption (TEC) by the EVs. The independent variables used for the study include changing real-life situations or external parameters, such as trip distance, tire type, driving style, power, odometer reading, EV model, city, motorway, country roads, air conditioning, and park heating. We compared the ML models’ performance along with the error analysis. A pairwise correlation study showed that trip distance has a high correlation coefficient (0.87) with TEC. XGBoost had better prediction accuracy (~92%) or R2 (0.92). Trip distance, power, heating, and odometer reading were the most important features influencing the TEC, identified using the shapley additive explanations method.",2021.0,2021-06-29 00:00:00,28,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bf43099563822c04eb58e6ac7c745680eafcbe7

10.1155/2022/9151847,Detection of DDoS Vulnerability in Cloud Computing Using the Perplexed Bayes Classifier,"Cloud computing security has been a critical issue with its increase in demand. One of the most challenging problems in cloud computing is detecting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The attack detection framework for the DDoS attack is tricky because of its nonlinear nature of interruption activities, atypical system traffic behaviour, and many features in the problem space. As a result, creating defensive solutions against these attacks is critical for mainstream cloud computing adoption. In this novel research, by using performance parameters, perplexed-based classifiers with and without feature selection will be compared with the existing machine learning algorithms such as naïve Bayes and random forest to prove the efficacy of the perplexed-based classification algorithm. Comparing the performance parameters like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, the proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 99%, which is higher than the existing algorithms, proving that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in detecting the DDoS attacks in cloud computing systems. To extend our research in the area of nature-inspired computing, we compared our perplexed Bayes classifier feature selection with nature-inspired feature selection like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and found that our classifier is highly efficient in comparison with GA and PSO and their accuracies are 2% and 8%, respectively, less than those of perplexed Bayes classifier.",2022.0,2022-07-19 00:00:00,17,41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f6bf33877df1d13c16b2bbe045411f426a2cd3a

We introduce an uncertainty‐controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA) based on ensemble machine learning predictions from different molecular representations that concurrently optimizes excited state energies, synthesizability, and exciton size for the discovery of singlet fission materials. The ucGA allows us to efficiently explore the chemical space spanned by the reFORMED fragment database, which consists of 45,000 cores and 5,000 substituents derived from crystallographic structures assembled in the FORMED repository. Running the ucGA in an exploitative setup performs local optimization on variations of known singlet fission scaffolds, such as acenes. In an explorative mode, hitherto unknown candidates displaying excellent excited state properties for singlet fission are generated. We suggest a class of heteroatom‐rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge‐transfer mediated singlet fission. When included in larger donor‐acceptor systems, these units exhibit localization of the triplet state, favorable diradicaloid character and suitable triplet energies for exciton injection into semiconductor solar cells.",2024.0,2024-09-25 00:00:00,1,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4880ef516028dd598fe9339429b36658530fd3c2
10.1021/acs.jcim.4c01107,Diffusion Models in De Novo Drug Design,"Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for molecular generation, particularly in the context of 3D molecular structures. Inspired by nonequilibrium statistical physics, these models can generate 3D molecular structures with specific properties or requirements crucial to drug discovery. Diffusion models were particularly successful at learning the complex probability distributions of 3D molecular geometries and their corresponding chemical and physical properties through forward and reverse diffusion processes. This review focuses on the technical implementation of diffusion models tailored for 3D molecular generation. It compares the performance, evaluation methods, and implementation details of various diffusion models used for molecular generation tasks. We cover strategies for atom and bond representation, architectures of reverse diffusion denoising networks, and challenges associated with generating stable 3D molecular structures. This review also explores the applications of diffusion models in de novo drug design and related areas of computational chemistry, such as structure-based drug design, including target-specific molecular generation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics of protein–ligand complexes. We also cover conditional generation on physical properties, conformation generation, and fragment-based drug design.

Originally developed in Pracht et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 22, 7169 (2020)] as an automated driver for calculations at the extended tight-binding level (xTB), it offers a variety of molecular- and metadynamics simulations, geometry optimization, and molecular structure analysis capabilities. Implemented algorithms include automated procedures for conformational sampling, explicit solvation studies, the calculation of absolute molecular entropy, and the identification of molecular protonation and deprotonation sites. Calculations are set up to run concurrently, providing efficient single-node parallelization. CREST is designed to require minimal user input and comes with an implementation of the GFNn-xTB Hamiltonians and the GFN-FF force-field. Furthermore, interfaces to any quantum chemistry and force-field software can easily be created. In this article, we present recent developments in the CREST code and show a selection of applications for the most important features of the program. An important novelty is the refactored calculation backend, which provides significant speed-up for sampling of small or medium-sized drug molecules and allows for more sophisticated setups, for example, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and minimum energy crossing point calculations.",2024.0,2024-03-21 00:00:00,61,172,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b885fe3743b661ab26e542ef209a5d7472b9630

Previous shallow learning and deep learning strategies adopt the single learning model approach for intrusion detection. The single learning model approach may experience problems to understand increasingly complicated data distribution of intrusion patterns. Particularly, the single deep learning model may not be effective to capture unique patterns from intrusive attacks having a small number of samples. In order to further enhance the performance of machine learning based IDS, we propose the Big Data based Hierarchical Deep Learning System (BDHDLS). BDHDLS utilizes behavioral features and content features to understand both network traffic characteristics and information stored in the payload. Each deep learning model in the BDHDLS concentrates its efforts to learn the unique data distribution in one cluster. This strategy can increase the detection rate of intrusive attacks as compared to the previous single learning model approaches. Based on parallel training strategy and big data techniques, the model construction time of BDHDLS is reduced substantially when multiple machines are deployed.",2020.0,2020-07-16 00:00:00,102,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c4cb10c6d40b8f1d570944269a0a2e680dd5eb6

10.1021/acsomega.2c06471,The Effect of Machine Learning Algorithms on the Prediction of Layer-by-Layer Coating Properties,"Layer-by-layer film (LbL) coatings made of polyelectrolytes are a powerful tool for surface modification, including the applications in the biomedical field, for food packaging, and in many electrochemical systems. However, despite the number of publications related to LbL assembly, predicting LbL coating properties represents quite a challenge, can take a long time, and be very costly. Machine learning (ML) methodologies that are now emerging can accelerate and improve new coating development and potentially revolutionize the field. Recently, we have demonstrated a preliminary ML-based model for coating thickness prediction. In this paper, we compared several ML algorithms for optimizing a methodology for coating thickness prediction, namely, linear regression, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Extra Tree Regressor. The current research has shown that learning algorithms are effective in predicting the coating output value, with the Extra Tree Regressor algorithm demonstrating superior predictive performance, when used in combination with optimized hyperparameters and with missing data imputation. The best predictors of the coating thickness were determined, and they can be later used to accurately predict coating thickness, avoiding measurement of multiple parameters. The development of optimized methodologies will ensure different reliable predictive models for coating property/function relations. As a continuation, the methodology can be adapted and used for predicting the outputs connected to antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties in order to be able to respond to actual biomedical problems such as antibiotic resistance, implant rejection, or COVID-19 outbreak.",2023.0,2023-01-29 00:00:00,10,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc4b936a32a89133c58b9e29d3bce6fac19d8ed8

In this context, new implant materials and coatings that deal with medical device-associated complications are required. Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory materials are also required for wound healing applications, especially in diabetic patients with chronic wounds. In this work, we present hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels with triple activity: antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and miRNA delivery agent. We demonstrate that polyarginine with a degree of polymerization of 30 (PAR30), which was previously shown to have a prolonged antibacterial activity, decreases inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated macrophages. In addition, PAR30 accelerated fibroblast migration in macrophage/fibroblast co-culture system, suggesting a positive effect on wound healing. Furthermore, PAR30 allowed to load miRNA into HA hydrogels, and then to deliver them into the cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first describing miRNA-loaded hydrogels with antibacterial effect and anti-inflammatory features. Such system can become a tool for the treatment of infected wounds, e.g. diabetic ulcers, as well as for foreign body response modulation. This article is protected by copyright.

The study aims to clarify the macrophage heterogeneity and phenotype dynamics, and pinpoint critical targets within efferocytosis in DKD. Methods Utilizing early human DKD sequencing data, we computed the potential communication between leukocytes and renal intrinsic cells. Subsequently, we scrutinized the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from CD45-enriched immune cells, concentrating on the macrophage subsets in DKD. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was conducted to explore cell development. Differential expression genes (DEGs) from macrophage subgroups and bulk RNA-sequencing were used to identify shared hub genes. The NephroseqV5 platform was employed to evaluate the clinical significance, and the expression of key molecules was validated in DKD tissues. Results Macrophage infiltration rose in DKD, causing inflammation through the release of chemokines. As time progressed, the number of resident macrophages substantially dropped, with diminishing M1-like and increasing M2-like phenotypes relative to early stages. Further analysis pointed to the most enrichment of macrophage function is the phagosome. We overlapped the DEGs with efferocytosis-related genes and identified key genes, including CD36, ITGAM, and CX3CR1, which exhibited significant correlations with macrophages and T cells. The Nephroseq database revealed that they are associated with proteinuria and renal function. Consistent with the validation set, in vivo experiments verified elevated expression levels of key molecules. Conclusions In essence, our research elucidated the dynamics in macrophage subtype transitions. It emphasized three pivotal genes as critical modulators of macrophage efferocytosis in DKD, indicating their potential as innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",2025.0,2025-02-19 00:00:00,1,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61e5330e744545c8b4c92f51c818223acaa277df

10.3390/ijms25115704,Identification of 3-Aryl-1-benzotriazole-1-yl-acrylonitrile as a Microtubule-Targeting Agent (MTA) in Solid Tumors,"Recently, a compound derived from recent scientific advances named 34 has emerged as the focus of this research, the aim of which is to explore its potential impact on solid tumor cell lines. Using a combination of bioinformatics and biological assays, this study conducted an in-depth investigation of the effects of 34. The results of this study have substantial implications for cancer research and treatment. 34 has shown remarkable efficacy in inhibiting the growth of several cancer cell lines, including those representing prostate carcinoma (PC3) and cervical carcinoma (HeLa). The high sensitivity of these cells, indicated by low IC50 values, underscores its potential as a promising chemotherapeutic agent. In addition, 34 has revealed the ability to induce cell cycle arrest, particularly in the G2/M phase, a phenomenon with critical implications for tumor initiation and growth. By interfering with DNA replication in cancer cells, 34 has shown the capacity to trigger cell death, offering a new avenue for cancer treatment. In addition, computational analyses have identified key genes affected by 34 treatment, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. These genes are involved in critical biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication and microtubule dynamics, all of which are central to cancer development and progression. In conclusion, this study highlights the different mechanisms of 34 that inhibit cancer cell growth and alter the cell cycle. These promising results suggest the potential for more effective and less toxic anticancer therapies.

Material and methods We used two publicly available datasets of postero-anterior chest radiographs, which are from Montgomery County, Maryland, and Shenzhen, China. A CNN (ConvNet) from scratch was trained to automatically detect TB on chest radiographs. Also, a CNN-based transfer learning approach using five different pre-trained models, including Inception_v3, Xception, ResNet50, VGG19, and VGG16 was utilized for classifying TB and normal cases from CXR images. The performance of models for testing datasets was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, precision, area under curve (AUC), and F1-score. Results All proposed models provided an acceptable accuracy for two-class classification. Our proposed CNN architecture (i.e., ConvNet) achieved 88.0% precision, 87.0% sensitivity, 87.0% F1-score, 87.0% accuracy, and AUC of 87.0%, which was slightly less than the pre-trained models. Among all models, Exception, ResNet50, and VGG16 provided the highest classification performance of automated TB classification with precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and AUC of 91.0%, and 90.0% accuracy. Conclusions Our study presents a transfer learning approach with deep CNNs to automatically classify TB and normal cases from the chest radiographs. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score for the detection of TB were found to be more than 87.0% for all models used in the study.

10.3322/caac.21708,"Cancer statistics, 2022","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes. Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized‐stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized‐stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3‐year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer.

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Public sector employees. Participants 3550 participants of the Finnish Retirement and Aging study. Primary and secondary outcome measures Participants estimated on a yearly questionnaire their weekly hours of different types of activities converted to metabolic equivalent of task-hour/week. Self-rated health was assessed on a 5-point Likert-like scale from poor to excellent and dichotomised as suboptimal and optimal. Multivariate trajectory analysis was used to distinguish different subgroups of trajectories. Multinomial regression analysis was used to describe the associations between covariates and the probability of being classified to a certain trajectory group. Results Three trajectory groups were identified, all displaying increasing activity during retirement with a simultaneous decrease in perceived suboptimal health. Physical activity peaked at 18 months after retirement and then slightly decreased, except for initially highly physically active participants (9%) with good self-rated health, who demonstrated a constant high level of physical activity. Male gender, professional occupation, being married or cohabiting, body mass index <30 kg/m2, not smoking and using alcohol below risk levels were associated with higher physical activity and better self-rated health.

Given the country’s aging population and recent liberalization of the two-child policy, understanding the effects of intergenerational caregiving on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals is crucial. This study aimed to explore the impact of intergenerational caregiving on mental health among middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals. Methods We analyzed data from the China Health and Aging Tracking Survey (CHARLS) 2013, consisting of 6602 participants finally. Personal information, family structure, financial support, health status, and physical measurements were selected for analysis. Correlation and regression analyses were used for relationships among variables controlling for potential confounding variables. Mental health status was evaluated using the depression self-rating scale. Results There is a significant positive effect of intergenerational care on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) people. Additionally, we re-profiled intergenerational care variables by considering the number and length of intergenerational caregivers, and found that the effects remained significant. Furthermore, the effects of intergenerational care vary across subgroups based on gender, age, nature of usual residence, marital status, and physical health status. Finally, we identified two mechanisms through which intergenerational caregiving positively affects mental health: intergenerational financial support and intergenerational spiritual support.

However, these associations have not been explored using procedures that analyze the sequential effects between risk factors of falling. The present study aimed to examine the effects of muscle strength, agility, and fear of falling on risk of falling using path analysis in community-dwelling older adults. In total, 49 elderly (female = 33, male = 16) participants aged between 65 and 76 years (M = 68.38 years; SD = 6.22) were included for analysis. Muscle strength, agility, fear of falling, and risk of falling were assessed using validated instruments for the older adult population. The proposed model shows that muscle strength was negatively associated with agility. Consequently, agility was negatively associated with fear of falling. The same trend appeared between fear of falling and risk of falling. The effect sizes were between small and medium for agility (R2 = 0.16), fear of falling, (R2 = 0.29), and risk of falling (R2 = 0.03). The main finding of the present study was that muscle strength was significantly correlated with agility, which, in turn, predicted fear of falling. Consequently, lower scores for fear of falling explained lower risk of falling in community-dwelling older adults. While muscle strength is a crucial component of physical fitness, only with adequate levels of agility can older adults possess the efficacy and ability to perform daily tasks.",2023.0,2023-03-01 00:00:00,20,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/989d201c64ef3de8ba5dbd33942bf4be94f507d2

Objective To ascertain the state of the science on social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions to improve all-hazard household disaster preparedness. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Databases, trial registers, reports, and websites were searched, and citation trails followed utilizing replicable methods. Individual, cluster, and cross-over randomized controlled trials of non-institutionalized, community-dwelling populations and non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after, and program evaluation studies were included. At least two review authors independently screened each potentially relevant study for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane’s RoB2 tool for randomized studies and ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies. Meta-analyses were applied using a random-effects model. Where meta-analysis was not indicated, results were synthesized using summary statistics of intervention effect estimates and vote counting based on effect direction. The evidence was rated using GRADE. Results 17 studies were included with substantial methodological and clinical diversity. No intervention effect was observed for preparedness supplies (OR = 6.12, 95% 0.13 to 284.37) or knowledge (SMD = 0.96, 95% CI −0.15 to 2.08) outcomes. A small positive effect (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91) was observed for preparedness behaviors, with very low certainty of evidence. No studies reported adverse effects from the interventions. Conclusion Research designs elucidating the efficacy of practical yet complex and multi- faceted social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions present substantial methodological challenges where rigorous study design elements may not match the contextual public health priority needs and resources where interventions were delivered. While the overall strength of the evidence was evaluated as low to very low, we acknowledge the valuable and informative work of the included studies. The research represents the seminal work in this field and provides an important foundation for the state of the science of household emergency preparedness intervention effectiveness and efficacy. The findings are relevant to disaster preparedness practice and research, and we encourage researchers to continue this line of research, using these studies and this review to inform ongoing improvements in study designs.",2024.0,2024-02-23 00:00:00,4,85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39ee4fd610d22be5c5ab9da1a59789ea5fe78026

10.1093/bioinformatics/btae197,DrivR-Base: a feature extraction toolkit for variant effect prediction model construction,"Motivation Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of numerous variants in the human genome. However, understanding their precise roles in diseases remains challenging due to their complex functional mechanisms. Various methodologies have emerged to predict the pathogenic significance of these genetic variants. Typically, these methods employ an integrative approach, leveraging diverse data sources that provide critical insights into genomic function. Despite the abundance of publicly available data sources and databases, the process of navigating, extracting, and pre-processing features for machine learning models can be daunting. Furthermore, researchers often invest substantial effort in feature extraction, only to later discover that these features lack informativeness. Results In this paper, we present DrivR-Base, an innovative resource that efficiently extracts and integrates molecular information (features) for single nucleotide variants from a wide range of databases and tools, including AlphaFold, ENCODE, and Variant Effect Predictor. The resulting features can be used as input for machine learning models designed to predict the pathogenic impact of human genome variants in disease. Moreover, these feature sets have applications beyond this, including haploinsufficiency prediction and the development of drug repurposing tools. We describe the resource’s development, practical applications, and potential for future expansion and enhancement.

Yet, few studies have integrated several multiplexed assays to map variant effects on gene expression in coding sequences. Here, we pioneered a multiplexed assay based on polysome profiling to measure variant effects on translation at scale, uncovering single-nucleotide variants that increase and decrease ribosome load. By combining high-throughput ribosome load data with multiplexed mRNA and protein abundance readouts, we mapped the cis-regulatory landscape of thousands of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) variants from RNA to protein and found numerous coding variants that alter COMT expression. Finally, we trained machine learning models to map signatures of variant effects on COMT gene expression and uncovered both directional and divergent impacts across expression layers. Our analyses reveal expression phenotypes for thousands of variants in COMT and highlight variant effects on both single and multiple layers of expression. Our findings prompt future studies that integrate several multiplexed assays for the readout of gene expression.",2023.0,2023-11-17 00:00:00,1,96,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b76329a07900d1c40f199af7529028e04099d67

10.1093/nar/gkab772,Comprehensive characterization of somatic variants associated with intronic polyadenylation in human cancers,"Abstract Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in cancer genome affect gene expression through various mechanisms depending on their genomic location. While somatic SNVs near canonical splice sites have been reported to cause abnormal splicing of cancer-related genes, whether these SNVs can affect gene expression through other mechanisms remains an open question. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing and exome data from 4,998 cancer patients covering ten cancer types and identified 152 somatic SNVs near splice sites that were associated with abnormal intronic polyadenylation (IPA). IPA-associated somatic variants favored the localization near the donor splice sites compared to the acceptor splice sites. A proportion of SNV-associated IPA events overlapped with premature cleavage and polyadenylation events triggered by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) inhibition. GC content, intron length and polyadenylation signal were three genomic features that differentiated between SNV-associated IPA and intron retention. Notably, IPA-associated SNVs were enriched in tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including the well-known TSGs such as PTEN and CDH1 with recurrent SNV-associated IPA events. Minigene assay confirmed that SNVs from PTEN, CDH1, VEGFA, GRHL2, CUL3 and WWC2 could lead to IPA. This work reveals that IPA acts as a novel mechanism explaining the functional consequence of somatic SNVs in human cancer.",2021.0,2021-09-11 00:00:00,16,65,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fd709ab19019eac62c692e165c46e2593624b53

10.3390/s21144846,Prediction of Pest Insect Appearance Using Sensors and Machine Learning,"The appearance of pest insects can lead to a loss in yield if farmers do not respond in a timely manner to suppress their spread. Occurrences and numbers of insects can be monitored through insect traps, which include their permanent touring and checking of their condition. Another more efficient way is to set up sensor devices with a camera at the traps that will photograph the traps and forward the images to the Internet, where the pest insect’s appearance will be predicted by image analysis. Weather conditions, temperature and relative humidity are the parameters that affect the appearance of some pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera. This paper presents a model of machine learning that can predict the appearance of insects during a season on a daily basis, taking into account the air temperature and relative humidity. Several machine learning algorithms for classification were applied and their accuracy for the prediction of insect occurrence was presented (up to 76.5%). Since the data used for testing were given in chronological order according to the days when the measurement was performed, the existing model was expanded to take into account the periods of three and five days. The extended method showed better accuracy of prediction and a lower percentage of false detections. In the case of a period of five days, the accuracy of the affected detections was 86.3%, while the percentage of false detections was 11%.

10.3390/s21062016,Integrating a Low-Cost Electronic Nose and Machine Learning Modelling to Assess Coffee Aroma Profile and Intensity,"Aroma is one of the main attributes that consumers consider when appreciating and selecting a coffee; hence it is considered an important quality trait. However, the most common methods to assess aroma are based on expensive equipment or human senses through sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and requires highly trained assessors to avoid subjectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the coffee intensity and aromas using a low-cost and portable electronic nose (e-nose) and machine learning modeling. For this purpose, triplicates of nine commercial coffee samples with different intensity levels were used for this study. Two machine learning models were developed based on artificial neural networks using the data from the e-nose as inputs to (i) classify the samples into low, medium, and high-intensity (Model 1) and (ii) to predict the relative abundance of 45 different aromas (Model 2). Results showed that it is possible to estimate the intensity of coffees with high accuracy (98%; Model 1), as well as to predict the specific aromas obtaining a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99), and no under- or over-fitting of the models were detected. The proposed contactless, nondestructive, rapid, reliable, and low-cost method showed to be effective in evaluating volatile compounds in coffee, which is a potential technique to be applied within all stages of the production process to detect any undesirable characteristics on–time and ensure high-quality products.",2021.0,2021-03-01 00:00:00,64,67,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c32bb19d177d0992563ea12bb19558a61205d23e

The evolution of the activities of the GSC over this period has been driven by evolving geographic, economic and political contexts and needs. Likewise, new technologies and evolving scientific methods and models shaped broadly the successive generations of GSC geoscience activities. The most recent GSC generation presented a mixed portfolio of large framework mapping geoscience programmes, and more targeted, hypothesis-driven geoscience research, and the development of decision support products for a range of government, industry and other stakeholders needs. Entering its eighth generation, the GSC and related organizations are embracing digital technologies for applications such as the evaluation of mineral resource potential, the evaluation of risks and the early warning of earthquakes. In order to do so, the GSC will need to develop new methods and systems in co-operation with other geological survey organizations, and target its data acquisition and research to further advance its ability to respond to the evolving needs of society to navigate geology through space and time, from the past to the present, and from the present to the future.",2019.0,2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fe4817185d4935c1d836876c2f0902c66d8f3ea

10.1155/2022/7751263,Review on Epileptic Seizure Prediction: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches,"Epileptic seizures occur due to brain abnormalities that can indirectly affect patient's health. It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world's population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.",2022.0,2022-01-20 00:00:00,53,84,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a814dd75b527314e694805539d53faf5d9bf3b72

10.3390/APP11073201,Automated Software Vulnerability Detection Based on Hybrid Neural Network,"Vulnerabilities threaten the security of information systems. It is crucial to detect and patch vulnerabilities before attacks happen. However, existing vulnerability detection methods suffer from long-term dependency, out of vocabulary, bias towards global features or local features, and coarse detection granularity. This paper proposes an automatic vulnerability detection framework in source code based on a hybrid neural network. First, the inputs are transformed into an intermediate representation with explicit structure information using lower level virtual machine intermediate representation (LLVM IR) and backward program slicing. After the transformation, the size of samples and the size of vocabulary are significantly reduced. A hybrid neural network model is then applied to extract high-level features of vulnerability, which learns features both from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The former is applied to learn local vulnerability features, such as buffer size. Furthermore, the latter is utilized to learn global features, such as data dependency. The extracted features are made up of concatenated outputs of CNN and RNN. Experiments are performed to validate our vulnerability detection method. The results show that our proposed method achieves excellent results with F1-scores of 98.6% and accuracy of 99.0% on the SARD dataset. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",2021.0,2021-04-02 00:00:00,27,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac701065bdcff3322e4ea8b8a4e2a6df0fe831b1

10.1155/2013/350358,Computational Systems Biology,"The complex biological systems consist of distinct molecules that exert their functions by interacting with each other, which makes it a big challenge to understand how the cellular machinery works. Recently, the accumulation of a large amount of multiscale omics data, such as next-generation sequencing data and protein interaction data, provides opportunity to investigate the functions of molecules from a systematic perspective. On the other hand, the analysis of these huge datasets demands efficient and robust computational methods. In this special issue, we reported the recent progress made in developing new computational methodologies to analyze the genomics data, construct gene networks, and identify disease genes. 
 
Understanding the Functions of Molecules in the Postgenomic Age. In recent years, the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology makes it more easier for researchers to access and analyze genetics data and has influential effects on the biomedical research community. However, compared with sequencing, computational analysis of the flooding sequencing data with appropriate tools is becoming a more important task when interpreting the data. In their review paper, M. P. Dolled-Filhart et al. described the pipeline for bioinformatics analysis of the NGS data, starting from alignment to variant calling as well as filtering and annotation. In each step, they discussed the tools or software that should be used as well as their advantages and caveats. This survey of the bioinformatics analysis of NGS data can help researchers to choose appropriate tools when dealing with the sequencing data. 
 
Along with the sequencing technology, lines of evidence show that a lot of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes. Unlike the protein-coding genes that are well studied, the functions of most ncRNAs are not clear. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop computational methods to predict the functions of the ncRNAs. H. Ma et al. conducted a survey about the computational approaches developed to predict and annotate the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which can help researchers to learn the progress in this filed and future directions in which bioinformaticists should work while annotating lncRNAs. 
 
While annotating the functions of molecules, standard and controlled vocabularies are required. Hence, the ontologies that are represented as abstract description systems of knowledge are becoming more and more popular recently. At the same time, it is becoming a difficult task to calculate the semantic similarity between ontology terms quantitatively. M. Gan et al. introduced popular methods in quantitating the semantic similarity between ontology terms and their software implementations. Furthermore, they classified these methods into distinct categories and discussed their advantages and shortcomings, which can help researchers to select appropriate tools and methods when working on ontologies. 
 
Gene expression profiles can describe the molecular mechanisms that underlie certain phenotypes. However, while analyzing the gene expression data, it is inappropriate to treat genes independently considering genes interact with each other within the cell. O. Frings et al. proposed a network-based approach to analyze the gene expression data and applied it to investigate the development of sex-specific chicken gonad and brain tissues. By combining the chicken network and the gene expression data, they identified some sex-biased characteristics, for example, same sex-biased genes tend to be tightly connected in the network, and provided new insights into the molecular underpinnings of sex-biased genes. 
 
Construction and Analysis of Gene Networks. Construction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a crucial step in systems biology, where gene expression data is widely explored to infer the GRNs. However, the high dimensionality and notorious noise of the gene expression data makes it a nontrivial task to infer the GRNs. N. You et al. presented a new Laplace error penalty (LEP) model to calculate the partial correlation coefficients between genes and construct the GRNs. Compared with the popular least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) approaches, the LEP method reached the highest precision. Except for gene expression data, integration of different data sources may improve the accuracy of inferred GRNs. H. Chen et al. surveyed the strategies to integrate distinct data sources and their effectiveness and recommended how to choose an appropriate strategy while integrating distinct data sources. N. Nakajima et al. proposed a novel network completion approach, DPLSQ, to infer gene networks. Benchmarking on artificial datasets, their proposed DPLSQ outperforms popular ARACNE and GeneNet with the highest accuracy. By investigating a 2-gene network, A. V. Spirov et al. found that gene cooption can affect the robustness of GRNs, and the findings provide new insights into the evolvability and robustness of GRNs. 
 
Network modules are found to be functional blocks of gene networks, the identification of which is becoming a hot research topic. By taking the hierarchical modular structure into account, S. Zhang presented a new stochastic block model to detect the hierarchical modules. Applied to the real yeast gene coexpression network, the proposed method can efficiently detect the hierarchical modular structures that are consistent with biological functions. Recently, it is found that a particular type of ncRNAs, microRNAs, plays important roles in gene regulation by working together with transcription factors. W. Mu et al. proposed a new local genetic algorithm to predict condition-specific regulatory modules that consist of microRNAs, transcription factors, and their commonly regulated genes, and these modules provide useful insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression. 
 
Computational Approaches to Hunting Disease-Associated Genes. The identification of genetic variants that are responsible for human diseases is critical for understanding the development of diseases and designing new effective drugs. Thanks to the genome-wide association studies (GWASs), some genetic variants that drive diseases have been identified, among which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are receiving more and more attention. In this issue, J. Wu and R. Jiang reviewed the databases that collect nsSNPs and summarized popular computational methods that identify deleterious nsSNPs. In addition, they introduced machine learning models that are useful in predicting deleterious nsSNPs. Beyond SNP-based association analysis, gene-based association analysis is receiving increasing attention. X. Guo et al. comprehensively compared these two approaches on the data from the study of addiction and found that these two approaches complement with each other and can get better results when used together. 
 
The differentially expressed genes identified from microarray data are generally regarded as candidate disease genes. However, the number of differentially expressed genes may reach hundreds or even thousands, thereby making it difficult to identify the potential disease genes. In this issue, L. Li et al. proposed a new hybrid approach to predict disease genes based on estimation of distribution algorithm and support vector machine. Benchmarking on B-cell lymphoma and colon cancer datasets, their method outperforms two other popular approaches and identify some new candidate genes for future validation.",2013.0,2013-03-12 00:00:00,653,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e8056466cd94a05011a683b22b742b61a2c052f

10.3390/pr11010082,Review of Methods for Diagnosing Faults in the Stators of BLDC Motors,"A brushless direct current (BLDC) motor is a type of permanent magnet machine that is highly efficient and powerful and requires occasional maintenance. Thanks to these fortunate characteristics, this type of motor has various applications in high-tech industries. However, since BLDC motors are often required to operate at high-speed rotations and under extreme conditions, temperature overshoots can appear during operation, provoking damage to the windings. The purpose of this review is to present the results of a recent investigation and recollection of different methods used for the diagnosis of electrical faults in the stator, such as turn-to-turn short circuits, coil-to-coil short circuits, phase-to-phase short circuits and phase open circuits. In particular, this review presents an analysis of the available diagnosis methods according to the type of fault, the method or technique used for the diagnosis, the evaluated physical variables and the context in which the methods were evaluated (in simulations or in experimental tests). Based on this analysis, the following classifications of diagnostic methods are proposed: signal-based, model-based and data-based methods.

10.3389/fnmol.2021.807969,Gabaergic Interneurons in Early Brain Development: Conducting and Orchestrated by Cortical Network Activity,"Throughout early phases of brain development, the two main neural signaling mechanisms—excitation and inhibition—are dynamically sculpted in the neocortex to establish primary functions. Despite its relatively late formation and persistent developmental changes, the GABAergic system promotes the ordered shaping of neuronal circuits at the structural and functional levels. Within this frame, interneurons participate first in spontaneous and later in sensory-evoked activity patterns that precede cortical functions of the mature brain. Upon their subcortical generation, interneurons in the embryonic brain must first orderly migrate to and settle in respective target layers before they can actively engage in cortical network activity. During this process, changes at the molecular and synaptic level of interneurons allow not only their coordinated formation but also the pruning of connections as well as excitatory and inhibitory synapses. At the postsynaptic site, the shift of GABAergic signaling from an excitatory towards an inhibitory response is required to enable synchronization within cortical networks. Concomitantly, the progressive specification of different interneuron subtypes endows the neocortex with distinct local cortical circuits and region-specific modulation of neuronal firing. Finally, the apoptotic process further refines neuronal populations by constantly maintaining a controlled ratio of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Interestingly, many of these fundamental and complex processes are influenced—if not directly controlled—by electrical activity. Interneurons on the subcellular, cellular, and network level are affected by high frequency patterns, such as spindle burst and gamma oscillations in rodents and delta brushes in humans. Conversely, the maturation of interneuron structure and function on each of these scales feeds back and contributes to the generation of cortical activity patterns that are essential for the proper peri- and postnatal development. Overall, a more precise description of the conducting role of interneurons in terms of how they contribute to specific activity patterns—as well as how specific activity patterns impinge on their maturation as orchestra members—will lead to a better understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological development and function of the nervous system.",2022.0,2022-01-03 00:00:00,32,230,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75eb4e19edd7d78a2dff8da5746952ba92dba391

An intriguing question is how physiological neuronal activity modifies the expression of these molecules in developing cortical networks. Here, we addressed this issue, focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the factors underlying cortical wiring. Real-time imaging of BDNF promoter activity in organotypic slice cultures revealed that patterned stimuli differentially regulated the increase and the time course of the promoter activity in upper layer neurons. Calcium imaging further demonstrated that stimulus-dependent increases in the promoter activity were roughly proportional to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration per unit time. Finally, optogenetic stimulation showed that the promoter activity was increased efficiently by patterned stimulation in defined cortical circuits. These results suggest that physiological stimulation patterns differentially tune activity-dependent gene expression in developing cortical neurons via cortical circuits, synaptic responses, and alteration of intracellular calcium signaling.",2021.0,2021-12-10 00:00:00,15,80,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85bea617bbce6c876755555dfbdc98947cf7b1f5

10.3389/fbuil.2022.834671,Digital Twins in the Construction Industry: A Perspective of Practitioners and Building Authority,"As the notion of data-driven analytics and turning data into action is becoming more salient in the construction industry, researchers and practitioners have recently devoted considerable effort to investigate the digital transformation of the industry. Along this journey, Digital Twin has been introduced to the industry as a concept that holds the promise to challenge the status-quo and address long standing problems of productivity, efficiency, and value. While this concept is becoming more familiar among practitioners, there is a lack of universal definitions of what the Digital Twin of a construction project is. Additionally, while identifying the purpose of Digital Twin is recognized as the first step in implementing Digital Twins, there is little discussion on the perception of construction practitioners of the extent to which Digital Twin can deliver value. To address these research gaps and building on the existing work on Digital Twins in the context of the construction industry, this paper first proposes a definition of the Digital Twin of a construction project. Next, a series of semi-structured interviews are conducted with nine construction practitioners to understand their perceptions on the use and challenges of Digital Twins. Thematic analysis is then used to analyze interview data and summarize Digital Twins applications, capabilities, and challenges. Forty direct applications were identified and grouped into seven capabilities. Digital Twins capabilities of Increase Transparency of Information and Real-Time Monitoring, Analysis, and Feedback were the most discussed with a total of eight applications each, followed by Better Stakeholder Collaboration which had seven applications. The discussion on challenges led to the identification of 34 challenges to implementing Digital Twin, grouped into six categories coded through thematic analysis. The category on Data Understanding, Preparation, and Usage Challenges was found to be the most critical for the interviewees. Additionally, the paper presents a case study on how building authority can be integrated into Digital Twins and leverage its use throughout the lifecycle of a building.

Intrapartum complications are one of the major causes of perinatal mortality. Fetal cardiotocograph (CTGs) can be used as a monitoring tool to identify high-risk women during labor. Aim: The objective of this study was to study the precision of machine learning algorithm techniques on CTG data in identifying high-risk fetuses. Methods: CTG data of 2126 pregnant women were obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Ten different machine learning classification models were trained using CTG data. Sensitivity, precision, and F1 score for each class and overall accuracy of each model were obtained to predict normal, suspect, and pathological fetal states. Model with best performance on specified metrics was then identified. Results: Determined by obstetricians' interpretation of CTGs as gold standard, 70% of them were normal, 20% were suspect, and 10% had a pathological fetal state. On training data, the classification models generated by XGBoost, decision tree, and random forest had high precision (>96%) to predict the suspect and pathological state of the fetus based on the CTG tracings. However, on testing data, XGBoost model had the highest precision to predict a pathological fetal state (>92%). Conclusion: The classification model developed using XGBoost technique had the highest prediction accuracy for an adverse fetal outcome. Lay health-care workers in low- and middle-income countries can use this model to triage pregnant women in remote areas for early referral and further management.",2019.0,2019-10-01 00:00:00,52,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/833e06df42d84d9787fbdd7a384d1cb5ddbd8dc9

However, the lack of regularly updated, continental-scale, and high spatial resolution (30 m) land cover data limit our ability to better understand the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of land surface changes. Despite the free availability of high spatial resolution Landsat satellite data, continental-scale land cover mapping using high resolution Landsat satellite data was not feasible until now due to the need for high-performance computing to store, process, and analyze this large volume of high resolution satellite data. In this study, we present an approach to quantify continental land cover and impervious surface changes over a long period of time (15 years) using high resolution Landsat satellite observations and Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform.

The proposed PSO based SVM classifier is able to select appropriate input features and optimize SVM parameters to increase classification accuracy. Further, a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method with a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) stimulus has been used to generate a dataset for purposes of classification. The proposed technique has been tested on a typical radial distribution network to identify ten different types of faults considering 12 given input features generated by using Simulink software and MATLAB Toolbox.

10.1515/popets-2017-0046,"Bayes, not Naïve: Security Bounds on Website Fingerprinting Defenses","Abstract Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks raise major concerns about users’ privacy. They employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to allow a local passive adversary to uncover the Web browsing behavior of a user, even if she browses through an encrypted tunnel (e.g. Tor, VPN). Numerous defenses have been proposed in the past; however, it is typically difficult to have formal guarantees on their security, which is most often evaluated empirically against state-of-the-art attacks. In this paper, we present a practical method to derive security bounds for any WF defense, where the bounds depend on a chosen feature set. This result derives from reducing WF attacks to an ML classification task, where we can determine the smallest achievable error (the Bayes error). Such error can be estimated in practice, and is a lower bound for a WF adversary, for any classification algorithm he may use. Our work has two main consequences: i) it allows determining the security of WF defenses, in a black-box manner, with respect to the state-of-the-art feature set and ii) it favors shifting the focus of future WF research to identifying optimal feature sets. The generality of this approach further suggests that the method could be used to define security bounds for other ML-based attacks.",2017.0,2017-02-24 00:00:00,37,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f0afe85012146ba0791eff4f0075494a53534fe

Machine learning evolved from the study of pattern recognition and explores the notion that algorithms can learn from and make predictions on data. And, as they begin to become more ‘intelligent’, these algorithms can overcome program instructions to make highly accurate, data-driven decisions. Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques (including machine learning, predictive modelling and data mining) and uses statistics (both historical and current) to estimate, or ‘predict’, future outcomes. These outcomes might be behaviors of a customer likely to exhibit or possible changes in the market, for example. Predictive analytics help us to understand possible future occurrences by analyzing the past.

10.3390/cancers15245759,Prognostic Implications of LRP1B and Its Relationship with the Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells in Gastric Cancer,"Simple Summary Gastric cancer (GC) has a poor prognosis, as it has often grown into an advanced stage when diagnosed. Genetic testing is crucial for establishing a treatment plan. In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to discover that LRP1B mutation was associated with a poor prognosis in GC. Through layer-by-layer research, it was found that LRP1B expression in GC was accompanied by a higher-level infiltration of CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163. It is concluded that LRP1B expression can stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration, thus bringing clinical benefits to GC patients. Abstract Background: Recent studies have shown that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1b (LRP1B), as a potential tumor suppressor, is implicated in the response to immunotherapy. The frequency of LRP1B mutation gene is high in many cancers, but its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not been determined. Methods: The prognostic value of LRP1B mutation in a cohort containing 100 patients having received radical gastrectomy for stage II–III GC was explored. By analyzing the data of LRP1B mRNA, the risk score of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LRP1B mutation-type and wild-type was constructed based on the TCGA-STAD cohort. The infiltration of tumor immune cells was evaluated by the CYBERSORT algorithm and verified by immunohistochemistry. Results: LRP1B gene mutation was an independent risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in GC patients (HR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.28–5.14, p = 0.008). The Kaplan–Meier curve demonstrated a shorter survival time in high-risk patients stratified according to risk score (p < 0.0001). CYBERSORT analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly concentrated in CD4+ T cells and macrophages. TIMER analysis suggested that LRP1B expression was associated with the infiltration of CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LRP1B was expressed in the tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells in 16/89 and 26/89 of the cohort, respectively. LRP1B-positive TCs were associated with higher levels of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163 (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that LRP1B-positive TCs represented an independent protective factor of DFS in GC patients (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.10–0.93, p = 0.042). Conclusions: LRP1B has a high prognostic value in GC. LRP1B may stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration to provide GC patients with survival benefits.",2023.0,2023-12-01 00:00:00,5,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d01e19228223f05b02d8ebe38df11ce3f38fc07

10.1021/acscentsci.8b00357,Using Machine Learning To Predict Suitable Conditions for Organic Reactions,"Reaction condition recommendation is an essential element for the realization of computer-assisted synthetic planning. Accurate suggestions of reaction conditions are required for experimental validation and can have a significant effect on the success or failure of an attempted transformation. However, de novo condition recommendation remains a challenging and under-explored problem and relies heavily on chemists’ knowledge and experience. In this work, we develop a neural-network model to predict the chemical context (catalyst(s), solvent(s), reagent(s)), as well as the temperature most suitable for any particular organic reaction. Trained on ∼10 million examples from Reaxys, the model is able to propose conditions where a close match to the recorded catalyst, solvent, and reagent is found within the top-10 predictions 69.6% of the time, with top-10 accuracies for individual species reaching 80–90%. Temperature is accurately predicted within ±20 °C from the recorded temperature in 60–70% of test cases, with higher accuracy for cases with correct chemical context predictions. The utility of the model is illustrated through several examples spanning a range of common reaction classes.

10.3390/en15124501,Application of Machine Learning for Lithofacies Prediction and Cluster Analysis Approach to Identify Rock Type,"Nowadays, there are significant issues in the classification of lithofacies and the identification of rock types in particular. Zamzama gas field demonstrates the complex nature of lithofacies due to the heterogeneous nature of the reservoir formation, while it is quite challenging to identify the lithofacies. Using our machine learning approach and cluster analysis, we can not only resolve these difficulties, but also minimize their time-consuming aspects and provide an accurate result even when the user is inexperienced. To constrain accurate reservoir models, rock type identification is a critical step in reservoir characterization. Many empirical and statistical methodologies have been established based on the effect of rock type on reservoir performance. Only well-logged data are provided, and no cores are sampled. Given these circumstances, and the fact that traditional methods such as regression are intractable, we have chosen to apply three strategies: (1) using a self-organizing map (SOM) to arrange depth intervals with similar facies into clusters; (2) clustering to split various facies into specific zones; and (3) the cluster analysis technique is used to identify rock type. In the Zamzama gas field, SOM and cluster analysis techniques discovered four group of facies, each of which was internally comparable in petrophysical properties but distinct from the others. Gamma Ray (GR), Effective Porosity(eff), Permeability (Perm) and Water Saturation (Sw) are used to generate these results. The findings and behavior of four facies shows that facies-01 and facies-02 have good characteristics for acting as gas-bearing sediments, whereas facies-03 and facies-04 are non-reservoir sediments. The outcomes of this study stated that facies-01 is an excellent rock-type zone in the reservoir of the Zamzama gas field.",2022.0,2022-06-20 00:00:00,33,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1338513b74f201e73971af7559e19e0ea1d1512

10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20555,"Federated Dynamic Sparse Training: Computing Less, Communicating Less, Yet Learning Better","Federated learning (FL) enables distribution of machine learning workloads from the cloud to resource-limited edge devices. Unfortunately, current deep networks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge devices, but also too large for communicating updates over bandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and experimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse Training (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained with substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and in-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that extracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this scheme, ""two birds are killed with one stone:'' instead of full models, each client performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse networks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly accommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse masks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an ""in-time self-ensembling effect'' into the training dynamics, and improves the FL performance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d. FL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our experiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it gains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same upload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2 times the upload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

Emerging immunotherapeutic approaches have ignited fresh optimism for patient outcomes. This investigation probes the link between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC through Mendelian Randomization and single-cell sequencing, aiming to unearth viable drug targets and dissect HCC's etiology. Methods: We conducted an exhaustive two-sample Mendelian Randomization analysis to ascertain the causal links between immune cell features and HCC, utilizing publicly accessible genetic datasets to explore the causal connections of 731 immune cell traits with HCC susceptibility. The integrity, diversity, and potential horizontal pleiotropy of these findings were rigorously assessed through extensive sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing was employed to penetrate the pathogenic underpinnings of HCC. Results: Establishing a significance threshold of pval_Inverse.variance.weighted at 0.05, our study pinpointed five immune characteristics potentially elevating HCC risk: B cell % CD3- lymphocyte (TBNK panel), CD25 on IgD+ (B cell panel), HVEM on TD CD4+ (Maturation stages of T cell panel), CD14 on CD14+ CD16- monocyte (Monocyte panel), CD4 on CD39+ activated Treg ( Treg panel). Conversely, various cellular phenotypes tied to BAFF-R expression emerged as protective elements. Single-cell sequencing unveiled profound immune cell phenotype interactions, highlighting marked disparities in cell communication and metabolic activities. Conclusion: Leveraging MR and scRNA-seq techniques, our study elucidates potential associations between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC, offering a window into the molecular interplays among cellular phenotypes, and addressing the limitations of mono-antibody therapeutic targets.",2024.0,2024-06-03 00:00:00,12,66,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58dc6f8c942361560fa67583eb2d852e433b8402

Nevertheless, its specific role in the context of gastric cancer (GC) remains uncertain. Methods: In this study, we integrated multi-omics algorithms to investigate the molecular characteristics of parthanatos in GC. A series of bioinformatics algorithms were utilized to explore clinical heterogeneity of GC and further predict the clinical outcomes. Results: Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the omics features of parthanatos in various human tumors, including genomic mutations, transcriptome expression, and prognostic relevance. We successfully identified 7 cell types within the GC microenvironment: myeloid cell, epithelial cell, T cell, stromal cell, proliferative cell, B cell, and NK cell. When compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, single-cell sequencing results from GC tissues revealed elevated scores for the parthanatos pathway across multiple cell types. Spatial transcriptomics, for the first time, unveiled the spatial distribution characteristics of parthanatos signaling. GC patients with different parthanatos signals often exhibited distinct immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming features, leading to different clinical outcomes. The integration of parthanatos signaling and clinical indicators enabled the creation of novel survival curves that accurately assess patients’ survival times and statuses. Conclusions: In this study, the molecular characteristics of parthanatos’ unicellular and spatial transcriptomics in GC were revealed for the first time.

10.18632/aging.205639,Molecular characteristics and prognostic significances of lysosomal-dependent cell death in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma,"Lysosomal-dependent cell death (LDCD) has an excellent therapeutic effect on apoptosis-resistant and drug-resistant tumors; however, the important role of LDCD-related genes (LDCD-RGs) in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) has not been reported. Initially, single-cell atlas of LDCD signal in KIRC was comprehensively depicted. We also emphasized the molecular characteristics of LDCD-RGs in various human neoplasms. Predicated upon the expressive quotients of LDCD-RGs, we stratified KIRC patients into tripartite cohorts denoted as C1, C2, and C3. Those allocated to the ambit of C1 evinced the most sanguine prognosis within the KIRC cohort, underscored by the acme of LDCD-RGs scores. This further confirms the significant role that LDCD-RGs play in both the pathophysiological foundation and clinical implications of KIRC. In culmination, by virtue of employing the LASSO-Cox analytical modality, we have ushered in an innovative and avant-garde prognostic framework tailored for KIRC, predicated on the bedrock of LDCD-RGs. The assemblage of KIRC instances was arbitrarily apportioned into constituents inclusive of a didactic cohort, an internally wielded validation cadre, and an externally administered validation cohort. Concurrently, patients were dichotomized into strata connoting elevated jeopardy synonymous with adverse prognostic trajectories, and conversely, diminished risk tantamount to favorable prognoses, contingent on the calibrated expressions of LDCD-RGs. Succinctly, our investigative findings serve to underscore the cardinal capacity harbored by LDCD-RGs within the KIRC milieu, concurrently birthing a pioneering prognostic schema intrinsically linked to the trajectory of KIRC and its attendant prognoses.",2024.0,2024-03-07 00:00:00,2,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72b7d73bc84580cfdafaeb08b2cdc62e7c6e8a64
10.18632/aging.205436,Combination of bulk RNA sequencing and scRNA sequencing uncover the molecular characteristics of MAPK signaling in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma,"The MAPK signaling pathway significantly impacts cancer progression and resistance; however, its functions remain incompletely assessed across various cancers, particularly in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive pan-cancer investigations of MAPK signaling, particularly within the context of KIRC. In this research, we obtained TCGA pan-cancer multi-omics data and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the MAPK signaling pathway. For in-depth investigation in KIRC, status of MAPK pathway was quantitatively estimated by ssGSEA and Ward algorithm was utilized for cluster analysis. Molecular characteristics and clinical prognoses of KIRC patients with distinct MAPK activities were comprehensively explored using a series of bioinformatics algorithms. Subsequently, a combination of LASSO and COX regression analyses were utilized sequentially to construct a MAPK-related signature to help identify the risk level of each sample. Patients in the C1 subtype exhibited relatively higher levels of MAPK signaling activity, which were associated with abundant immune cell infiltration and favorable clinical outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of KIRC samples identified seven distinct cell types, and endothelial cells in tumor tissues had obviously higher MAPK scores than normal tissues. The immunohistochemistry results indicated the reduced expression levels of PAPSS1, MAP3K11, and SPRED1 in KIRC samples. In conclusion, our study represents the first integration of bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing to elucidate the molecular characteristics of MAPK signaling in KIRC, providing a solid foundation for precision oncology.",2024.0,2024-01-12 00:00:00,9,67,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a5bafab0e2691595bb49c7cf05fed766bbe8c19

A sample of 167 children, ages 5–11 years (mean ± SD: 8.0 ± 1.8 years), performed up to eight seated sedentary activities while wearing accelerometers on both wrists. Activities included: reading books, sorting cards, cutting and pasting, playing board games, eating snacks, playing with tablets, watching TV, and writing. Direct observation verified sedentary behavior from light activity. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to determine optimal cut-point thresholds. Quantile regression models estimated differences between dominant and non-dominant placement. Results: The optimal cut-point threshold for the non-dominant wrist was 203 counts/5 s with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 71.56, 70.83, and 0.72, respectively. A 10-fold cross-validation revealed an average AUC of 0.70. Statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences in median counts ranging from 7 to 46 counts/5 s were found between dominant and non-dominant placement in five out of eight sedentary activities, with the dominant wrist eliciting higher counts/5 s. Conclusion: Results from this study support the recommendation to place accelerometers on the non-dominant wrist to minimize “noise” during seated sedentary behaviors.",2018.0,2018-09-26 00:00:00,10,21,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/98d03a27d7dd6b1894c55f43881b8b07de0cf41d

10.1371/journal.pone.0279604,A deep graph convolutional neural network architecture for graph classification,"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful deep learning methods for non-Euclidean structure data and achieve impressive performance in many fields. But most of the state-of-the-art GCN models are shallow structures with depths of no more than 3 to 4 layers, which greatly limits the ability of GCN models to extract high-level features of nodes. There are two main reasons for this: 1) Overlaying too many graph convolution layers will lead to the problem of over-smoothing. 2) Graph convolution is a kind of localized filter, which is easily affected by local properties. To solve the above problems, we first propose a novel general framework for graph neural networks called Non-local Message Passing (NLMP). Under this framework, very deep graph convolutional networks can be flexibly designed, and the over-smoothing phenomenon can be suppressed very effectively. Second, we propose a new spatial graph convolution layer to extract node multiscale high-level node features. Finally, we design an end-to-end Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network II (DGCNNII) model for graph classification task, which is up to 32 layers deep. And the effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by quantifying the graph smoothness of each layer and ablation studies. Experiments on benchmark graph classification datasets show that DGCNNII outperforms a large number of shallow graph neural network baseline methods.",2023.0,2023-03-10 00:00:00,18,77,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c582bdbd4787c2f81c999de76445e440a600d835

Usually, not all columns show important values. As a result, the machine learning models may perform poorly since the noise or unnecessary columns may confound the algorithms. To address this issue, various feature selection methods have been developed to evaluate large dimensional datasets and identify their subsets of pertinent features. The data, however, frequently skews feature selection algorithms. As a result, ensemble approaches have emerged as a substitute that incorporates the benefits of single feature selection algorithms and makes up for their drawbacks. In order to handle feature selection on datasets with large dimensionality, this research aims to grasp the key ideas and links in the process of aggregating feature selection methods. The suggested idea is tested by creating a cross-validation implementation that combines a number of Python packages with functionality to enable the feature selection techniques. By identifying pertinent features in the human, chimpanzee, and dog DNA datasets, the performance of the implementation was demonstrated.",2022.0,2022-12-29 00:00:00,5,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c6892d5fbc88c3af2ac052a01cbcd45c7359837

10.4114/ia.v18i56.1159,An Automated Defect Prediction Framework using Genetic Algorithms: A Validation of Empirical Studies,"Today, it is common for software projects to collect measurement data through development processes. With these data, defect prediction software can try to estimate the defect proneness of a software module, with the objective of assisting and guiding software practitioners. With timely and accurate defect predictions, practitioners can focus their limited testing resources on higher risk areas. This paper reports the results of three empirical studies that uses an automated genetic defect prediction framework. This framework generates and compares different learning schemes (preprocessing + attribute selection + learning algorithms) and selects the best one using a genetic algorithm, with the objective to estimate the defect proneness of a software module. The first empirical study is a performance comparison of our framework with the most important framework of the literature. The second empirical study is a performance and runtime comparison between our framework and an exhaustive framework. The third empirical study is a sensitivity analysis. The last empirical study, is our main contribution in this paper. Performance of the software development defect prediction models (using AUC, Area Under the Curve) was validated using NASA-MDP and PROMISE data sets. Seventeen data sets from NASA-MDP (13) and PROMISE (4) projects were analyzed running a NxM-fold cross-validation. A genetic algorithm was used to select the components of the learning schemes automatically, and to assess and report the results. Our results reported similar performance between frameworks.

Despite its potential to transform current pedagogies and learning experiences through engaging, interactive, and fascinating educational techniques, research is limited in exploring its application, usability, and user experience, particularly for Thai undergraduate students in learning computer engineering courses. In response, we designed and developed an innovative metaverse-based learning system called the AIIS collaborative learning interface, tailored to European undergraduate students. While the original intent of AIIS was to cater to medical students, in this study, our objective was to assess its usability and applicability for computer science and engineering students, specifically focusing on the Asian demographic. After an initial pilot with European students in their local context, the research was extended to Thailand, where 21 Thai undergraduate students evaluated the platform’s usability. The observations from this study indicate that AIIS provides a dynamic, user-friendly learning environment. Nevertheless, the evaluation process unveiled some usability flaws that offer informative directions for future enhancements. Drawing from our observations, we formulated usability guidelines to guide designers and developers toward crafting more efficient metaverse systems, particularly those intended for educational use.

Due to this problem, the present investigation has been focused on studying how time management is linked to academic stress in university students. This research study of a basic/substantive non-experimental type and correlational level has been developed under a quantitative approach with a cross section. The sample consisted of 328 students of both genders, selected from a public university in the city of Lima. Two standardized tools were adapted for data collection. Two questionnaires were also applied: time management and academic stress. The results showed that there was an inverse correlation between time management and academic stress (Spearman's Rho = .413), as well as for the dimensions of academic stress: stressors (- .405), symptoms (-, 387) and coping (, 286). It was concluded that the inverse relationships between the parameters studied will be reflected in the values obtained.

10.3390/sym12030454,Failure Prediction Model Using Iterative Feature Selection for Industrial Internet of Things,"This paper presents a failure prediction model using iterative feature selection, which aims to accurately predict the failure occurrences in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. In general, vast amounts of data are collected from various sensors in an IIoT environment, and they are analyzed to prevent failures by predicting their occurrence. However, the collected data may include data irrelevant to failures and thereby decrease the prediction accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a failure prediction model using iterative feature selection. To build the model, the relevancy between each feature (i.e., each sensor) and the failure was analyzed using the random forest algorithm, to obtain the importance of the features. Then, feature selection and model building were conducted iteratively. In each iteration, a new feature was selected considering the importance and added to the selected feature set. The failure prediction model was built for each iteration via the support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the failure prediction model having the highest prediction accuracy was selected. The experimental implementation was conducted using open-source R. The results showed that the proposed failure prediction model achieved high prediction accuracy.",2020.0,2020-03-12 00:00:00,10,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8a6b4f30728cb9d92f589644988396f54e7cc12

10.3390/bdcc7010045,Textual Feature Extraction Using Ant Colony Optimization for Hate Speech Classification,"Feature selection and feature extraction have always been of utmost importance owing to their capability to remove redundant and irrelevant features, reduce the vector space size, control the computational time, and improve performance for more accurate classification tasks, especially in text categorization. These feature engineering techniques can further be optimized using optimization algorithms. This paper proposes a similar framework by implementing one such optimization algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), incorporating different feature selection and feature extraction techniques on textual and numerical datasets using four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest (RF). The aim is to show the difference in the results achieved on both datasets with the help of comparative analysis. The proposed feature selection and feature extraction techniques assist in enhancing the performance of the machine learning model. This research article considers numerical and text-based datasets for stroke prediction and detecting hate speech, respectively. The text dataset is prepared by extracting tweets consisting of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments from Twitter API. A maximum improvement in accuracy of 10.07% is observed for Random Forest with the TF-IDF feature extraction technique on the application of ACO. Besides, this study also highlights the limitations of text data that inhibit the performance of machine learning models, justifying the difference of almost 18.43% in accuracy compared to that of numerical data.",2023.0,2023-03-06 00:00:00,21,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7542cd204cf08d7512bf6aac24e697a720df4f7c

10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3242911,Surface Electromyography-Based Analysis of the Lower Limb Muscle Network and Muscle Synergies at Various Gait Speeds,"Gait movement is an important activity in daily human life. The coordination of gait movement is directly affected by the cooperation and functional connectivity between muscles. However, the mechanisms of muscle operation at different gait speeds remain unclear. Therefore, this study addressed the gait speed effect on the changes in cooperative modules and functional connectivity between muscles. To this end, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals were collected from eight key lower extremity muscles of twelve healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at high, middle, and low motion speeds. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) was applied to the sEMG envelope and intermuscular coherence matrix, yielding five muscle synergies. Muscle functional networks were constructed by decomposing the intermuscular coherence matrix, revealing different layers of functional muscle networks across frequencies. In addition, the coupling strength between cooperative muscles grew with gait speed. Different coordination patterns among muscles with changes in gait speed related to the neuromuscular system regulation were identified.",2023.0,2023-02-06 00:00:00,7,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf75253c6ec3360d80c0ccd9ea7202af2d63710d

10.5565/rev/elcvia.1187,Fully Convolutional Networks for Text Understanding in Scene Images,"Text understanding in scene images has gained plenty of attention in the computer vision community and it is an important task in many applications as text carries semantically  rich  information  about  scene  content  and  context.   For  instance, reading text in a scene can be applied to autonomous driving, scene understanding or assisting visually impaired people. The general aim of scene text understanding is to localize and recognize text in scene images. Text regions are first localized in the original image by a trained detector model and afterwards fed into a recognition module. The tasks of localization and recognition are highly correlated since an inaccurate localization can affect the recognition task. The main purpose of this thesis is to devise efficient methods for scene text understanding. We investigate how the latest results on deep learning can advance text understanding pipelines. Recently, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and derived methods have achieved a significant performance on semantic segmentation and pixel level classification tasks. Therefore, we took benefit of the strengths of FCN approaches in order to detect and recognize text in natural scenes images.",2020.0,2020-02-07 00:00:00,1,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1b49c740123e2e0a3b00afe10e856d9d54d71aa
10.1609/AAAI.V34I07.6812,Real-time Scene Text Detection with Differentiable Binarization,"Recently, segmentation-based methods are quite popular in scene text detection, as the segmentation results can more accurately describe scene text of various shapes such as curve text. However, the post-processing of binarization is essential for segmentation-based detection, which converts probability maps produced by a segmentation method into bounding boxes/regions of text. In this paper, we propose a module named Differentiable Binarization (DB), which can perform the binarization process in a segmentation network. Optimized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can adaptively set the thresholds for binarization, which not only simplifies the post-processing but also enhances the performance of text detection. Based on a simple segmentation network, we validate the performance improvements of DB on five benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and speed. In particular, with a light-weight backbone, the performance improvements by DB are significant so that we can look for an ideal tradeoff between detection accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, with a backbone of ResNet-18, our detector achieves an F-measure of 82.8, running at 62 FPS, on the MSRA-TD500 dataset.

10.3390/math11030700,Smart Traffic Shaping Based on Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Multimedia Streaming over 5G-VANET Communication Technology,"Vehicles serve as mobile nodes in a high-mobility MANET technique known as the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), which is used in urban and rural areas as well as on highways. The VANET, based on 5G (5G-VANET), provides advanced facilities to the driving of vehicles such as reliable communication, less end-to-end latency, a higher data rate transmission, reasonable cost, and assured quality of experience (QoE) for delivered services. However, the crucial challenge with these recent technologies is to design a real-time multimedia traffic shaping that maintains smooth connectivity under the unpredictable change of channel capacity and data rate due to handover for rapid vehicle mobility among roadside units. This research proposes a smart real-time multimedia traffic shaping to control the amount and the rate of the traffic sent to the 5G-VANET based on distributed reinforcement learning (RMDRL). The proposed mechanism selects the accurate decisions of coding parameters such as quantization parameters, group of pictures, and frame rate that are used to manipulate the required traffic shaping of the multimedia stream on the 5G-VANET. Furthermore, the impact of the aforementioned three coding parameters has been comprehensively studied using five video clips to achieve the optimal traffic rate value for real-time multimedia streaming on 5G communication. The proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline traffic shaping in terms of peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and end-to-end frame delay. This research will open new comfortable facilities for vehicle manufacturing to enhance the data communication system on the 5G-VANET.",2023.0,2023-01-30 00:00:00,21,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9a83eed8739574b9e90f7257c60a3cf37991082

The lower productivity exhibited by these SMEs in Sri Lanka was identified as a result of the high participation rate of female entrepreneurs in the informal economy. An unfavourable environment has been created obstructing the transition of women entrepreneurs towards the upper echelon of the business world through diverse impediments. Thus, the research focused on exploring the barriers that hinder the business growth of women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises. Accordingly, the research was conducted as secondary research: a literature survey. In Sri Lanka, a minor percentage of female participation in small and medium enterprises occurs due to limited access to financial resources, lack of financial literacy, social prejudices, social and cultural restrictions, and limited opportunities for networking and communicating with external resources. Thus, closing the gender gap in education, giving access to capital through a concerted policy action and providing women entrepreneurs with opportunities to improve their financial literacy and educational level were highlighted as the major recommendations in the study to empower women entrepreneurs to climb the value chain. Women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises need to be facilitated with greater access to the domestic, regional and international markets in order to enable them to expand their businesses with productivity and innovation. Thus, vital policy measures should be taken to mitigate the barriers involved in formalizing the business mechanisms while focusing on increasing the benefits that women entrepreneurs can gain through that standardizing process.",2024.0,2024-04-30 00:00:00,2,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74c05632db18369cf611f7fb54e761b9f83eb999

 In addition to the influence of climate change on water availability and hydrological risks, the effects on water quality are in the early stages of investigations. This study aims to consolidate the latest interdisciplinary research in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of assessment of water quality parameters and its prediction. This research paper specifically explores the intricate relationship between climate change and water quality parameters at Sandia station, situated within the Narmada basin in Central India. As global climatic patterns continue to shift, the repercussions on water resources have gained prominence. In this work, electrical conductivity is predicted using the KERAS data processing environment on TensorFlow. The root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), etc. are calculated between observed and predicted values to assess the model performance. A total of 10 models are developed depending upon the input geometry from past monthly timelines. The results indicate that Model no. 8, with 10 inputs performs the best based on the R2 value of 0.889.

10.37965/jait.2022.0127,Standard NER Tagging Scheme for Big Data Healthcare Analytics Built on Unified Medical Corpora,"The motivation for this research comes from the gap found in discovering the common ground for medical context learning through analytics for different purposes of  diagnosing, recommending, prescribing or treating patients for uniform phenotype features from patients’ profile. Authors of this paper while searching for possible solutions for medical context learning found that unified corpora tagged with medical nomenclature was missing to train the analytics for medical context learning. Therefore, here we demonstrated a mechanism to come up with uniform NER (Named Entity Recognition) tagged medical corpora that is fed with 14407 endocrine patients’ dataset in CSV format diagnosed with DM and comorbidity diseases. The other corpus is of ICD-10-CM coding scheme in text format taken from www.icd10data.com. ICD-10-CM corpus is to be tagged for understanding the medical context with uniformity for which we are conducting different experiments using common NLP techniques and frameworks like; TensorFlow, Keras, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. 
In our preliminary experiments albeit label sets in form of (instance, label) pair were tagged with Sequential() model formed on TensorFlow.Keras and Bi-LSTM NLP algorithms.

10.3390/info11020108,fastai: A Layered API for Deep Learning,"fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4–5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more. We used this library to successfully create a complete deep learning course, which we were able to write more quickly than using previous approaches, and the code was more clear.

10.3390/electronics10192386,Straightforward Heterogeneous Computing with the oneAPI Coexecutor Runtime,"Heterogeneous systems are the core architecture of most computing systems, from high-performance computing nodes to embedded devices, due to their excellent performance and energy efficiency. Efficiently programming these systems has become a major challenge due to the complexity of their architectures and the efforts required to provide them with co-execution capabilities that can fully exploit the applications. There are many proposals to simplify the programming and management of acceleration devices and multi-core CPUs. However, in many cases, portability and ease of use compromise the efficiency of different devices—even more so when co-executing. Intel oneAPI, a new and powerful standards-based unified programming model, built on top of SYCL, addresses these issues. In this paper, oneAPI is provided with co-execution strategies to run the same kernel between different devices, enabling the exploitation of static and dynamic policies. This work evaluates the performance and energy efficiency for a well-known set of regular and irregular HPC benchmarks, using two heterogeneous systems composed of an integrated GPU and CPU. Static and dynamic load balancers are integrated and evaluated, highlighting single and co-execution strategies and the most significant key points of this promising technology. Experimental results show that co-execution is worthwhile when using dynamic algorithms and improves the efficiency even further when using unified shared memory.",2021.0,2021-09-29 00:00:00,10,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8b1c0fd63a70abf4617e1803f171887663ca098

10.3390/s22010215,"Infrared Thermography for Measuring Elevated Body Temperature: Clinical Accuracy, Calibration, and Evaluation","Infrared thermographs (IRTs) implemented according to standardized best practices have shown strong potential for detecting elevated body temperatures (EBT), which may be useful in clinical settings and during infectious disease epidemics. However, optimal IRT calibration methods have not been established and the clinical performance of these devices relative to the more common non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) remains unclear. In addition to confirming the findings of our preliminary analysis of clinical study results, the primary intent of this study was to compare methods for IRT calibration and identify best practices for assessing the performance of IRTs intended to detect EBT. A key secondary aim was to compare IRT clinical accuracy to that of NCITs. We performed a clinical thermographic imaging study of more than 1000 subjects, acquiring temperature data from several facial locations that, along with reference oral temperatures, were used to calibrate two IRT systems based on seven different regression methods. Oral temperatures imputed from facial data were used to evaluate IRT clinical accuracy based on metrics such as clinical bias (Δcb), repeatability, root-mean-square difference, and sensitivity/specificity. We proposed several calibration approaches designed to account for the non-uniform data density across the temperature range and a constant offset approach tended to show better ability to detect EBT. As in our prior study, inner canthi or full-face maximum temperatures provided the highest clinical accuracy. With an optimal calibration approach, these methods achieved a Δcb between ±0.03 °C with standard deviation (σΔcb) less than 0.3 °C, and sensitivity/specificity between 84% and 94%. Results of forehead-center measurements with NCITs or IRTs indicated reduced performance. An analysis of the complete clinical data set confirms the essential findings of our preliminary evaluation, with minor differences. Our findings provide novel insights into methods and metrics for the clinical accuracy assessment of IRTs. Furthermore, our results indicate that calibration approaches providing the highest clinical accuracy in the 37–38.5 °C range may be most effective for measuring EBT. While device performance depends on many factors, IRTs can provide superior performance to NCITs.",2021.0,2021-12-29 00:00:00,28,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/443b9932d295ca3a014e7d874b4bd77a33a276bd

10.3389/fnut.2022.784114,Higher Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio Is Associated With a Higher Risk of Stroke-Associated Pneumonia,"Objective Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is a frequent complication in stroke patients. This present study aimed to investigate the association between stress hyperglycemia and SAP. Methods Patients were screened between February 2013 and August 2020 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. We divided the blood glucose of the patients at admission by the glycated hemoglobin to calculate the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between SAP and SHR, with the confounders being controlled. Further, subgroup analyses were separately performed for stroke patients with and without diabetes. Results A total of 2,039 patients were finally recruited, of which 533 (26.14%) were diagnosed with SAP. SHR were divided into four quartiles in the logistic regression analysis, the highest SHR quartile (SHR ≥ 1.15) indicated a higher risk of SAP (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.13–2.19, p = 0.01) in total patients. In patients without diabetes, the third quantile (SHR = 0.96–1.14) and the highest quantile (SHR ≥ 1.15) were both related to a higher risk of SAP (both p < 0.05). However, we did not find such an association in diabetic patients. Conclusion SHR was significantly associated with the risk of SAP in patients without diabetes. Adequate attention should be paid to the patients with high SHR levels at admission, especially those without diabetes.",2022.0,2022-02-22 00:00:00,22,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4219d642e5104297c8b218904aae0c28625ee10
10.3389/fneur.2022.800614,A2DS2 Score Combined With Clinical and Neuroimaging Factors Better Predicts Stroke-Associated Pneumonia in Hyperacute Cerebral Infarction,"Objective To investigate the predictors of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) and poor functional outcome in patients with hyperacute cerebral infarction (HCI) by combining clinical factors, laboratory tests and neuroimaging features. Methods We included 205 patients with HCI from November 2018 to December 2019. The diagnostic criterion for SAP was occurrence within 7 days of the onset of stroke. Poor outcome was defined as a functional outcome based on a 3-months MRS score >3. The relationship of demographic, laboratory and neuroimaging variables with SAP and poor outcome was investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Fifty seven (27.8%) patients were diagnosed with SAP and 40 (19.5%) developed poor outcomes. A2DS2 score (OR = 1.284; 95% CI: 1.048–1.574; P = 0.016), previous stroke (OR = 2.630; 95% CI: 1.122–6.163; P = 0.026), consciousness (OR = 2.945; 95% CI: 1.514–5.729; P < 0.001), brain atrophy (OR = 1.427; 95% CI: 1.040–1.959; P = 0.028), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.715; 95% CI: 1.163–2.528; P = 0.006) were independently associated with the occurrence of SAP. Therefore, we combined these variables into a new SAP prediction model with the C-statistic of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78–0.90). Fasting plasma glucose (OR = 1.404; 95% CI: 1.202–1.640; P < 0.001), NIHSS score (OR = 1.088; 95% CI: 1.010–1.172; P = 0.026), previous stroke (OR = 4.333; 95% CI: 1.645–11.418; P = 0.003), SAP (OR = 3.420; 95% CI: 1.332–8.787; P = 0.011), basal ganglia-dilated perivascular spaces (BG-dPVS) (OR = 2.124; 95% CI: 1.313–3.436; P = 0.002), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.680; 95% CI: 1.166–2.420; P = 0.005) were independently associated with poor outcome. The C-statistic of the outcome model was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81–0.94). Furthermore, the SAP model significantly improved discrimination and net benefit more than the A2DS2 scale, with a C-statistic of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.83). Conclusions After the addition of neuroimaging features, the models exhibit good differentiation and calibration for the prediction of the occurrence of SAP and the development of poor outcomes in HCI patients. The SAP model could better predict the SAP, representing a helpful and valid tool to obtain a net benefit compared with the A2DS2 scale.",2022.0,2022-02-04 00:00:00,6,63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30fd98944b72c8e5e86cd6dea2aa1aff7607a38b

Purpose: To determine the microbiology and outcomes of SAP in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) for patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: In this observational study, included patients were divided into SAP and non-SAP based on a comprehensive analysis of symptom, imaging, and laboratory results. Baseline characteristics, clinical characteristics, microbiology, and outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: Of 200 patients, 42.5% developed SAP after the onset of stroke, and they had a lower proportion of non-smokers (p = 0.002), lower GCS score (p < 0.001), higher serum CRP (p < 0.001) at ICU admission, and a higher proportion of males (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.039) than patients with non-SAP. Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (78.8%), followed by Gram-positive aerobic cocci (29.4%). The main pathogens included K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Burkholderia cepacia. SAP prolonged length of MV (p < 0.001), duration of ICU stay (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p = 0.027), shortened MV-free days by 28 (p < 0.001), and caused elevated vasopressor application (p = 0.001) and 60-day mortality (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis suggested that patients with coma (p < 0.001) have a higher risk of developing SAP. Conclusion: The microbiology of SAP is similar to early phase of HAP and VAP. SAP prolongs the duration of MV and length of ICU and hospital stays, but also markedly increases 60-day mortality.",2021.0,2021-12-03 00:00:00,12,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/98f23e7af26de31f82392e5a38db3e0bbb21b208

Based on extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (xDLVO) theory, the major fouling mechanisms, i.e., Lifshitz–van der Waals (LW), electrostatic (EL), and acid–base (AB) interactions, were for the first time quantitatively analyzed for model HA–bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures at different solution conditions. Results indicated that the pH, ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration of the solution significantly affected the physicochemical properties and the interaction energy between the polyethersulfone (PES) membrane and HA–BSA mixtures. The free energy of cohesion of the HA–BSA mixtures was minimum at pH = 3.0, ionic strength = 100 mM, and c(Ca2+) = 1.0 mM. The AB interaction energy was a key contributor to the total interaction energy when the separation distance between the membrane surface and HA–BSA mixtures was less than 3 nm, while the influence of EL interaction energy was of less importance to the total interaction energy. The attractive interaction energies of membrane–foulant and foulant–foulant increased at low pH, high ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration, thus aggravating membrane fouling, which was supported by the fouling experimental results. The obtained findings would provide valuable insights for the quantitative understanding of membrane fouling mechanisms of mixed organics during MF.",2018.0,2018-09-22 00:00:00,14,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2200fa0a28621ad857fb7e273cf5b41db54baef1
10.3390/W10070847,Membrane Fouling for Produced Water Treatment: A Review Study From a Process Control Perspective,"The offshore oil and gas industry is experiencing increasing water cuts as the reservoirs mature. The increase in produced water stresses the currently deployed deoiling technologies, resulting in more oil in the discharged water. Deploying membrane filtration to reduce the hydrocarbon concentration inherits additional complications related to fouling of the membranes: A process where the accumulation of material within and on the membrane surface adds additional flow resistance. This paper reviews and analyses the fouling detection, removal, prevention, dynamical and static modeling, with emphasis on how the membrane process can be manipulated from a process control perspective. The majority of the models rely on static descriptions or are limited to a narrow range of operating conditions which limits the usability of the models. This paper concludes that although the membrane filtration has been successfully applied and matured in many other industrial areas, challenges regarding cost-effective mitigation of fouling in the offshore deoiling applications, still exist. Fouling-based modeling combined with online parameter identification could potentially expand the operating range of the models and facilitate advanced control design to address transient performance and scheduling of fouling removal methods, resulting in cost-effective operation of membrane filtration systems. With the benefits of membrane filtration, it is predicted that membrane technology will be incorporated in produced water treatment, if the zero-discharge policies are enforced globally.",2018.0,2018-06-26 00:00:00,110,139,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0361d30d697336ccdb7da1c9fd739035d79daa7d

The failed unit is repaired either by an in-house repairer within an exponential patience time T or by an external expert who works faster but charges more. When there are two repair facilities, we allow the regular repairer to begin repair or to continue repair beyond T if the expert is busy. Two models arise accordingly as the expert repairs one or all failed units during each visit. We show that (1) adding a second spare to a one-unit system already backed by a spare raises A∞ as well as ω; (2) thereafter, adding a second repair facility improves both criteria further. Finally, we determine whether the expert must repair one or all failed units to maximize these criteria and fulfill the maintenance management objectives better than previously studied models.",2022.0,2022-03-08 00:00:00,15,18,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/882ad773662d528b62daaa1aa69bb234a0f5ec7f

10.1002/ente.202300914,Time Series Prediction of Solar Power Generation Using Trend Decomposition,"High‐accuracy predictions of future solar power generations are important for monitoring, maintenance, dispatching, and scheduling. The goal of this study is to create a forecasting workflow that increases prediction accuracy independent of the machine learning method and has minimal computational requirements. The proposed trend decomposition method incorporates irradiance and seasonal features as exogenous inputs. In order to extract the linear part of the data, a moving average filter is used. The nonlinear (stable) component of the time series is then calculated by subtracting this linear part from the original data. The stable portion is modeled using several machine learning methods, while the ordinary least squares method is applied to the linear series. By aggregating both results, the final forecast is obtained. The forecasting performances of the machine learning algorithms on unprocessed data are used as baselines for evaluations. Improvements up to 39% in the mean absolute error and up to 31% in the root mean square error metrics are observed compared to the baselines. Experimental results show that the proposed trend decomposition with extrapolation method increases the forecasting performance and generalization capacity of machine learning algorithms.",2023.0,2023-12-09 00:00:00,5,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/611dce439727471404d96e5bec3eb64a735c3ecf

10.15587/1729-4061.2022.259653,Application of artificial neural network for wheat yield forecasting,"A given model of yield forecasting using an artificial neural network connects the wheat crop with the amount of productive moisture in the soil, soil fertility, weather, and factors in the presence of pests, diseases, and weeds. The difficulty of creating a yield forecast system is in the correct choice of predictors that have the greatest impact on yield.
To build the model, moisture in the 100 cm layer of the soil, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, humus, and soil acidity in the soil were used as input parameters. The amount of precipitation over 4 months, the average air temperature for the same period, as well as the presence of diseases, pests, and weeds were also taken into consideration. Data on 13 districts of the North Kazakhstan region in the period from 2008 to 2017 were used. The output parameter was the yield of spring wheat over the same time period.
The relative importance of input variables in relation to the output variable was used to determine the weight values of input variables.
An artificial neural network of error backpropagation was used as a method. The advantage of this method is that the quality of the forecast increases with a large amount of training data, as well as the ability to model nonlinear relationships between different data sources.
After training the artificial neural network and obtaining predictive data, good results were achieved for predicting wheat yields (p=0.52, mean absolute error in percentage (MAPE)=12.02 %, root mean square error (RMSE)=3.368).
Thus, it is assumed that the developed model for forecasting wheat yields based on data can be easily adapted for other crops and places and will allow the adoption of the right strategies to ensure food security",2022.0,2022-06-30 00:00:00,12,59,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38bb9e7cf235c5109456569e4dad4e653b4921fc

10.32890/JICT2019.18.1.8277,CELLULAR NETWORK TRAFFIC PREDICTION USING EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING METHODS,"Wireless traffic prediction plays an important role in network planning and management, especially for real-time decision making and short-term prediction. Systems require high accuracy, low cost, and low computational complexity prediction methods. Although exponential smoothing is an effective method, there is a lack of use with cellular networks and research on data traffic. The accuracy and suitability of this method need to be evaluated using several types of traffic. Thus, this study introduces the application of exponential smoothing as a method of adaptive forecasting of cellular network traffic for cases of voice (in Erlang) and data (in megabytes or gigabytes). Simple and Error, Trend, Seasonal (ETS) methods are used for exponential smoothing. By investigating the effect of their smoothing factors in describing cellular network traffic, the accuracy of forecast using each method is evaluated. This research comprises a comprehensive analysis approach using multiple case study comparisons to determine the best fit model. Different exponential smoothing models are evaluated for various traffic types in different time scales. The experiments are implemented on real data from a commercial cellular network, which is divided into a training data part for modeling and test data part for forecasting comparison. This study found that ETS framework is not suitable for hourly voice traffic, but it provides nearly the same results with Holt–Winter’s multiplicative seasonal (HWMS) in both cases of daily voice and data traffic. HWMS is presumably encompassed by ETC framework and shows good results in all cases of traffic. Therefore, HWMS is recommended for cellular network traffic prediction due to its simplicity and high accuracy.  ",2018.0,2018-12-11 00:00:00,24,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b01b4f8a5ef036990dd6b541d8351fb1c159d4f

On such a research stand, the propagation of sound wave was investigated as a function of distance, at different heights, for situations without the acoustic screen and after its installation, testing various solutions on its upper edge. On the basis of the conducted tests, the shielding effectiveness of the analyzed test samples was determined. In the second part of the article, a computational model was made, which corresponded to laboratory conditions so that it was possible to carry out the simulation of acoustic field distribution in the same configuration as in the laboratory tests.

10.3389/fnins.2020.00259,Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Novel Approach Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning,"Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common practice. Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD.

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling chemistry at unprecedented computational speeds given accurate reference data. However, certain tasks, such as charge assignment, do not have a unique solution. Herein, we use a machine learning algorithm to discover a new charge assignment model by learning to replicate molecular dipole moments across a large, diverse set of nonequilibrium conformations of molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms. The new model, called Affordable Charge Assignment (ACA), is computationally inexpensive and predicts dipoles of out-of-sample molecules accurately. Furthermore, dipole-inferred ACA charges are transferable to dipole and even quadrupole moments of much larger molecules than those used for training. We apply ACA to dynamical trajectories of biomolecules and produce their infrared spectra. Additionally, we find that ACA assigns similar charges to Charge Model 5 but with greatly reduced computational cost.",2018.0,2018-06-22 00:00:00,109,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5010579f8442e2fec34c277d6fc8e10a6bdbcf3

10.3389/fimmu.2022.1072526,Identification of the osteoarthritis signature gene PDK1 by machine learning and its regulatory mechanisms on chondrocyte autophagy and apoptosis,"Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease frequently diagnosed in the elderly and middle-aged population. However, its specific pathogenesis has not been clarified. This study aimed to identify biomarkers for OA diagnosis and elucidate their potential mechanisms for restoring OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis in vitro. Material and methods Two publicly available transcriptomic mRNA OA-related datasets (GSE10575 and GSE51588) were explored for biomarker identification by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). We applied the GSE32317 and GSE55457 cohorts to validate the markers’ efficacy for diagnosis. The connections of markers to chondrocyte autophagy and apoptosis in OA were also comprehensively explored in vitro using molecular biology approaches, including qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results We identified 286 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were enriched in the ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. After external cohort validation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, PDK1 was finally identified as a diagnostic marker for OA. The pharmacological properties of BX795-downregulated PDK1 expression inhibited LPS-induced chondrocyte inflammation and apoptosis and rescued OA-dysregulated autophagy. Additionally, the phosphorylation of the mediators associated with the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways was significantly downregulated, indicating the regulatory function of PDK1 in apoptosis and autophagy via MAPK and PI3K/AKT-associated signaling pathways in chondrocytes. A significantly positive association between the PDK1 expression and Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Plasma cells, and activated CD4 memory T cells, as well as an evident negative correlation between T cells follicular helper and CD4 naive T cells, were detected in the immune cell infiltration analysis. Conclusions PDK1 can be used as a diagnostic marker for OA. Inhibition of its expression can rescue OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibit apoptosis by reducing the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways.",2023.0,2023-01-06 00:00:00,11,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12d9dc29928fff4157ad8c3bdb56a6f263914743
10.3390/cells11213430,"Identification of SLC3A2 as a Potential Therapeutic Target of Osteoarthritis Involved in Ferroptosis by Integrating Bioinformatics, Clinical Factors and Experiments","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of arthritis that causes joint pain and limited mobility. In recent years, some studies have shown that the pathological process of OA chondrocytes is related to ferroptosis. Our study aims to identify and validate differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) in OA chondrocytes and to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms. RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by four methods: limma-voom, edgeR, DESeq2, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interactions (PPI), and cytoHubba of Cytoscape were applied to identify hub genes. Clinical OA cartilage specimens were collected for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting (WB), histological staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and transfection. Sankey diagram was used to visualize the relationships between the expression level of SLC3A2 in the damaged area and clinical factors. Based on bioinformatics analysis, clinical factors, and experiment validation, SLC3A2 was identified as a hub gene. It was down-regulated in OA cartilage compared to normal cartilage (p < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that SLC3A2 was associated with ferroptosis-related functions. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression level of SLC3A2 in the OA cartilage-damaged area was closely related to BMI, obesity grade, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Furthermore, in vitro experiments validated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. In summary, we demonstrated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. These findings provide a new idea for the study of the pathogenesis of OA, thus providing new means for the clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy of OA.",2022.0,2022-10-30 00:00:00,33,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82f403b176c0944c37183592186ed35e3da94224
10.1155/2022/5600190,Identification of Biomarkers Associated with Diagnosis of Osteoarthritis Patients Based on Bioinformatics and Machine Learning,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is thought to be the most prevalent chronic joint disease. The incidence of OA is rising because of the ageing population and the epidemic of obesity. This research was designed for the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers for OA and analyzing the possible association between critical genes and infiltrated immune cells. 10 OA samples from patients with spinal OA and 10 normal samples were collected. GSE55235 and GSE55457 datasets including human OA and normal samples were downloaded from the GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between 20 OA and 20 controls. SVM-RFE analysis and LASSO regression model were carried out to screen possible markers. The compositional patterns of the 22 types of immune cell fraction in OA were determined by the use of CIBERSORT. The expression level of the biomarkers in OA was examined by the use of RT-PCR. In this study, an overall 44 DEGs were identified: 18 genes were remarkably upregulated and 26 genes were distinctly downregulated. KEGG pathway analyses revealed that pathways were significantly enriched including IL-17 signal path, rheumatoid arthritis, TNF signal path, and lipid and atherosclerosis. Based on the results of machine learning, we identified APOLD1 and EPYC as critical diagnostic genes in OA, which were further confirmed using ROC assays. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that APOLD1 was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Moreover, we found that EPYC was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Overall, our findings might provide some novel clue for the exploration of novel markers for OA diagnosis.

10.22608/APO.2018479,Promising Artificial Intelligence‐Machine Learning‐Deep Learning Algorithms in Ophthalmology,"Abstract: The lifestyle of modern society has changed significantly with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) technologies in recent years. Artificial intelligence is a multidimensional technology with various components such as advanced algorithms, ML and DL. Together, AI, ML, and DL are expected to provide automated devices to ophthalmologists for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders in the near future. In fact, AI, ML, and DL have been used in ophthalmic setting to validate the diagnosis of diseases, read images, perform corneal topographic mapping and intraocular lens calculations. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the 3 most common causes of irreversible blindness on a global scale. Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively detect the progression of a number of pathologies including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders. There are 2 methods of imaging used as diagnostic methods in ophthalmic practice: fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Of note, OCT has become the most widely used imaging modality in ophthalmology settings in the developed world. Changes in population demographics and lifestyle, extension of average lifespan, and the changing pattern of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, DR, AMD, and glaucoma create a rising demand for such images. Furthermore, the limitation of availability of retina specialists and trained human graders is a major problem in many countries.

Each year about one million people die as a result of suicidal behavior becoming an economic, social and human problem. On the other hand, the use of Social Media as a means of communication is becoming extremely popular, through which their emotional states and impressions are exchanged. Therefore, it is no surprise that more and more people with depression publish their suicide notes in these communication channels. In this context, Information Technologies and Communications and, more specifically, Language Technologies play an important role in the early detection of the depression, their causes and their terrible consequences. Based on these considerations, it is mandatory to provide societal, environmentally approaches and solutions to tackle these societal challenges.

10.1101/209171,"Power, false discovery rate and Winner’s Curse in eQTL studies","Investigation of the genetic architecture of gene expression traits has aided interpretation of disease and trait-associated genetic variants, however key aspects of expression quantitative trait (eQTL) study design and analysis remain understudied. We used extensive, empirically-driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests, and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency <10% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with ≥80% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies >25%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called “Winner’s Curse”, was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) which led to more accurate effect size estimation. These insights provide a foundation for future eQTL studies, especially those with sampling constraints and subtly different conditions.",2017.0,2017-10-25 00:00:00,108,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a82173ddc291b7f605ea5f0950f0e094d6890130
10.1101/208447,Genetics of trans-regulatory variation in gene expression,"Heritable variation in gene expression provides a critical bridge between differences in genome sequence and the biology of many traits, including common human diseases. However, the sources of most regulatory genetic variation remain unknown. Here, we used transcriptome profiling in 1,012 yeast segregants to map the genetic basis of variation in gene expression with high statistical power. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that together account for over 70% of the total genetic contribution to variation in mRNA levels, allowing us to examine the sources of regulatory variation comprehensively. We found that variation in the expression of a typical gene has a complex genetic architecture involving multiple eQTL. We also detected hundreds of eQTL pairs with significant non-additive interactions in an unbiased genome-wide scan. Although most genes were influenced by a local eQTL located close to the gene, most expression variation arose from distant, trans-acting eQTL located far from their target genes. Nearly all distant eQTL clustered at 102 “hotspot” locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes and altered expression of their target genes though both direct and indirect mechanisms. Many local eQTL had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in trans. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.",2017.0,2017-10-24 00:00:00,134,127,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8932f29b432ca127ce0df3469b6e67990deb9a1f

There is, however, still a dearth of study about whether graduate students acquire the employability skills that businesses want of them because of their higher education. To determine a student's future employment and career path, it is critical to evaluate their soft skills. An emerging area called educational data mining (EDM) aims to gather enormous volumes of academic data produced and maintained by educational institutions and to derive explicit and specific information from it. This paper aims to predict students' soft skills such as professional, analytical, linguistic, communication, and ethical skills, based on their socio-economic, academic, and institutional data by leveraging data mining methods and machine learning techniques. All five soft skills were predicted using prediction models created using linear regression, probabilistic neural networks, and simple regression tree techniques. This study used a dataset from an open source that Universidad Technologica de Bolivar published. It covers academic, social, and economic data for 12,411 students. The experimental results demonstrated that the linear regression algorithm performed better than the others in predicting all five soft skills compared to machine learning methods.

To predict students' employability before graduation, machine learning models were employed. These include logistic regression; decision tree, random forest, and an unsupervised clustering (K-Means) algorithm. This research, therefore, aims to predict the full-time employability of undergraduate students based on academic and experience employability attributes – including cumulative grade point average (CGPA), student industrial work experience scheme (SIWES), co-curricular activities, gender, and union groupings before graduation. Primary datasets of 218 graduate students in the last four academic calendar years (2016 – 2021) from the Computer Science Department of Federal University Dutse were rated. The results demonstrate that Random Forest Classifier predict students employability the best with an accuracy of 98% and f1-score of 0.99 compare to logistic regression and decision tree.

10.1073/pnas.2018863118,Scalable deep learning to identify brick kilns and aid regulatory capacity,"Significance Monitoring compliance with environmental regulations is a global challenge. It is particularly difficult for governments in low-income countries, where informal industry is responsible for a large amount of pollution, because the governments lack the ability to locate and monitor large numbers of dispersed polluters. This study demonstrates an accurate, scalable machine-learning approach for identifying brick kilns, a highly polluting informal industry in Bangladesh, in satellite imagery. Our data reveal widespread violations of the national regulations governing brick manufacturing, which has implications for the health and well-being of the country. Our approach offers a low-cost, replicable method for regulatory agencies to generate information on key pollution sources. Improving compliance with environmental regulations is critical for promoting clean environments and healthy populations. In South Asia, brick manufacturing is a major source of pollution but is dominated by small-scale, informal producers who are difficult to monitor and regulate—a common challenge in low-income settings. We demonstrate a low-cost, scalable approach for locating brick kilns in high-resolution satellite imagery from Bangladesh. Our approach identifies kilns with 94.2% accuracy and 88.7% precision and extracts the precise GPS coordinates of every brick kiln across Bangladesh. Using these estimates, we show that at least 12% of the population of Bangladesh (>18 million people) live within 1 km of a kiln and that 77% and 9% of kilns are (illegally) within 1 km of schools and health facilities, respectively. Finally, we show how kilns contribute up to 20.4 μg/m3 of PM2.5 (particulate matter of a diameter less than 2.5 μm) in Dhaka when the wind blows from an unfavorable direction. We document inaccuracies and potential bias with respect to local regulations in the government data.

10.1073/pnas.2016238117,Satellites can reveal global extent of forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet,"Significance Forced labor in fisheries is increasingly recognized as a human rights crisis. Until recently, its extent was poorly understood and no tools existed for systematically detecting forced labor risk on individual fishing vessels on a global scale. Here we use satellite data and machine learning to identify these high-risk vessels and find widespread risk of forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet. This information provides new opportunities for unique market, enforcement, and policy interventions. This also provides a proof of concept for how remotely sensed dynamic individual behavior can be used to infer forced labor abuses. While forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet has been widely documented, its extent remains unknown. No methods previously existed for remotely identifying individual fishing vessels potentially engaged in these abuses on a global scale. By combining expertise from human rights practitioners and satellite vessel monitoring data, we show that vessels reported to use forced labor behave in systematically different ways from other vessels. We exploit this insight by using machine learning to identify high-risk vessels from among 16,000 industrial longliner, squid jigger, and trawler fishing vessels. Our model reveals that between 14% and 26% of vessels were high-risk, and also reveals patterns of where these vessels fished and which ports they visited. Between 57,000 and 100,000 individuals worked on these vessels, many of whom may have been forced labor victims. This information provides unprecedented opportunities for novel interventions to combat this humanitarian tragedy. More broadly, this research demonstrates a proof of concept for using remote sensing to detect forced labor abuses.",2020.0,2020-12-21 00:00:00,54,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c81a9de116a2deb9d6f0cc75b565380298b0c91e

Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activities in rural and remote locations may provide heightened opportunities to conceal the alleged human rights violations associated with mining, such as: hazardous working conditions, health impacts, child labour, child trafficking, and debt bondage. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method, teamed with high temporal frequency Sentinel-1 imagery, for monitoring ASM activity in rural locations of the “Copperbelt”, the DRC. The results show that the ISBAS descriptive variables (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) were significantly different (p-value = ≤ 0.05) between mining and non-mining areas. Additionally, a significant difference was found for the ISBAS descriptive variables mean, standard deviation, and minimum between the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnels). As expected, a high level of subsidence (i.e., negative ISBAS pixel value) was a clear indicator of mine activity. Trial activity thresholds were set for the descriptive variables mean (-2.43 mm/yr) and minimum (-5.36 mm/yr) to explore an ISBAS approach to active mine identification. The study concluded that the ISBAS method has great potential as a monitoring tool for ASM, with the ability to separate mining and non-mining areas based on surface motion values, and further distinguish the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnel).

10.3390/pr11020496,Study on Thermal Degradation Processes of Polyethylene Terephthalate Microplastics Using the Kinetics and Artificial Neural Networks Models,"Because of its slow rate of disintegration, plastic debris has steadily risen over time and contributed to a host of environmental issues. Recycling the world’s increasing debris has taken on critical importance. Pyrolysis is one of the most practical techniques for recycling plastic because of its intrinsic qualities and environmental friendliness. For scale-up and reactor design, an understanding of the degradation process is essential. Using one model-free kinetic approach (Friedman) and two model-fitting kinetic methods (Arrhenius and Coats-Redfern), the thermal degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) microplastics at heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 °C/min was examined in this work. Additionally, a powerful artificial neural network (ANN) model was created to forecast the heat deterioration of PET MPs. At various heating rates, the TG and DTG thermograms from the PET MPs degradation revealed the same patterns and trends. This showed that the heating rates do not impact the decomposition processes. The Friedman model showed activation energy values ranging from 3.31 to 8.79 kJ/mol. The average activation energy value was 1278.88 kJ/mol from the Arrhenius model, while, from the Coats-Redfern model, the average was 1.05 × 104 kJ/mol. The thermodynamics of the degradation process of the PET MPs by thermal treatment were all non-spontaneous and endergonic, and energy was absorbed for the degradation. It was discovered that an ANN, with a two-layer hidden architecture, was the most effective network for predicting the output variable (mass loss%) with a regression coefficient value of (0.951–1.0).",2023.0,2023-02-07 00:00:00,24,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0781ed1743f7a0486b83d2d8a74feb76becb25d
10.3390/polym15010241,Pyrolysis Process of Mixed Microplastics Using TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS,"Microplastics have become a ubiquitous contaminant in the environment. The present study focuses on the identification, characterization, and quantification techniques for tracking microplastics. Due to their unique compositional structure, unambiguous identification of individual polymers in various plastic samples, usually comprised of mixtures of individual polymers, remains a challenge. Therefore, there is limited research on the pyrolysis characterization of mixed samples. In this study, two analytical methods, TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS combined with thermogravimetric analysis were used to evaluate the thermal-degradation process of individual and mixed samples of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The primary interaction was the volatilization of terephthalic acid bound to chlorine molecules. The reduction of vinyl-ester functional groups and aromatic hydrocarbon intermediates related to olefin branching was confirmed. Char formation was increased, due to aromatic compounds from PET and PVC. All of the polymers used in the study may be underestimated in quantity, due to combined volatilizations during pyrolysis. TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS showed forceful advantages in identifying mixed microplastics through different discrimination mechanisms. The study provides deep insight into pyrolysis behaviors and the interactions of mixed polymers, and the obtained results can help better comprehend the complex pyrolysis process.",2023.0,2023-01-01 00:00:00,20,59,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0343eee68ec1b686feee5d799bb0b4c21d45929

10.3390/diagnostics10050329,Deep Learning Based Automatic Malaria Parasite Detection from Blood Smear and Its Smartphone Based Application,"Malaria is a life-threatening disease that is spread by the Plasmodium parasites. It is detected by trained microscopists who analyze microscopic blood smear images. Modern deep learning techniques may be used to do this analysis automatically. The need for the trained personnel can be greatly reduced with the development of an automatic accurate and efficient model. In this article, we propose an entirely automated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for the diagnosis of malaria from the microscopic blood smear images. A variety of techniques including knowledge distillation, data augmentation, Autoencoder, feature extraction by a CNN model and classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are performed under three training procedures named general training, distillation training and autoencoder training to optimize and improve the model accuracy and inference performance. Our deep learning-based model can detect malarial parasites from microscopic images with an accuracy of 99.23% while requiring just over 4600 floating point operations. For practical validation of model efficiency, we have deployed the miniaturized model in different mobile phones and a server-backed web application. Data gathered from these environments show that the model can be used to perform inference under 1 s per sample in both offline (mobile only) and online (web application) mode, thus engendering confidence that such models may be deployed for efficient practical inferential systems.",2020.0,2020-05-01 00:00:00,117,80,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52af55894aa3a28e1c782d5154af7faa3bb90f60

However, the application of convolutional networks has been proposed only very recently and has remained largely unexplored. In this paper we describe a convolutional neural network architecture for functional connectome classification called connectome-convolutional neural network (CCNN). Our results on simulated datasets and a publicly available dataset for amnestic mild cognitive impairment classification demonstrate that our CCNN model can efficiently distinguish between subject groups. We also show that the connectome-convolutional network is capable to combine information from diverse functional connectivity metrics and that models using a combination of different connectivity descriptors are able to outperform classifiers using only one metric. From this flexibility follows that our proposed CCNN model can be easily adapted to a wide range of connectome based classification or regression tasks, by varying which connectivity descriptor combinations are used to train the network.",2017.0,2017-07-20 00:00:00,109,63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aab5933ff0250b341ffcaaa45a2fd6ba629e04e7

10.3389/fncom.2015.00066,Detection of subjects and brain regions related to Alzheimer's disease using 3D MRI scans based on eigenbrain and machine learning,"Purpose: Early diagnosis or detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the normal elder control (NC) is very important. However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions. Method: First, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of AD subjects. Coefficients of MIE with values higher than 0.98 quantile were highlighted to obtain the discriminant regions that distinguish AD from NC. Results: The experiments showed that the proposed method can predict AD subjects with a competitive performance with existing methods, especially the accuracy of the polynomial kernel (92.36 ± 0.94) was better than the linear kernel of 91.47 ± 1.02 and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of 86.71 ± 1.93. The proposed eigenbrain-based CAD system detected 30 AD-related brain regions (Anterior Cingulate, Caudate Nucleus, Cerebellum, Cingulate Gyrus, Claustrum, Inferior Frontal Gyrus, Inferior Parietal Lobule, Insula, Lateral Ventricle, Lentiform Nucleus, Lingual Gyrus, Medial Frontal Gyrus, Middle Frontal Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Paracentral Lobule, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Postcentral Gyrus, Posterial Cingulate, Precentral Gyrus, Precuneus, Subcallosal Gyrus, Sub-Gyral, Superior Frontal Gyrus, Superior Parietal Lobule, Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, Thalamus, Transverse Temporal Gyrus, and Uncus).

The above problems mean that the manufacturing industry knowledge utilization rate is low. This paper proposes a novel Chinese fine-grained NER (named entity recognition) method based on symmetry lightweight deep multinetwork collaboration (ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF) and model transfer considering active learning (MTAL) to research fine-grained named entity recognition of a few labeled Chinese textual data types. The method is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF was applied for verification in the CLUENER2020 dataset (Public dataset) to get a pretrained model; the experiments show that the model obtains an F1 score of 0.8962, which is better than the best baseline algorithm, an improvement of 9.2%. In the second stage, the pretrained model was transferred into the Manufacturing-NER dataset (our dataset), and we used the active learning strategy to optimize the model effect. The final F1 result of Manufacturing-NER was 0.8931 after the model transfer (it was higher than 0.8576 before the model transfer); so, this method represents an improvement of 3.55%. Our method effectively transfers the existing knowledge from public source data to scientific target data, solving the problem of named entity recognition with scarce labeled domain data, and proves its effectiveness.",2020.0,2020-11-30 00:00:00,20,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53d1c4cce25c5d9f74b0c1c8a32341e69752ebfe
10.3390/electronics9061001,Innovative Deep Neural Network Modeling for Fine-Grained Chinese Entity Recognition,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a basic but crucial task in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and big data analysis. The recognition of named entities based on Chinese is more complicated and difficult than English, which makes the task of NER in Chinese more challenging. In particular, fine-grained named entity recognition is more challenging than traditional named entity recognition tasks, mainly because fine-grained tasks have higher requirements for the ability of automatic feature extraction and information representation of deep neural models. In this paper, we propose an innovative neural network model named En2BiLSTM-CRF to improve the effect of fine-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks. This proposed model including the initial encoding layer, the enhanced encoding layer, and the decoding layer combines the advantages of pre-training model encoding, dual bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and a residual connection mechanism. Hence, it can encode information multiple times and extract contextual features hierarchically. We conducted sufficient experiments on two representative datasets using multiple important metrics and compared them with other advanced baselines. We present promising results showing that our proposed En2BiLSTM-CRF has better performance as well as better generalization ability in both fine-grained and coarse-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks.",2020.0,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9e45d4a6b3de0186e2cb430ecf01dcf17697342

Named entity recognition is a natural language processing task carried out to obtain morpheme sequences with specific meanings, such as person, location, and organization names. Although morphological analysis and named entity recognition are closely associated with each other, they have been independently studied and have exhibited the inevitable error propagation problem. Hence, we propose an integrated model based on label attention networks that simultaneously performs morphological analysis and named entity recognition. The proposed model comprises two layers of neural network models that are closely associated with each other. The lower layer performs a morphological analysis, whereas the upper layer performs a named entity recognition. In our experiments using a public gold-labeled dataset, the proposed model outperformed previous state-of-the-art models used for morphological analysis and named entity recognition. Furthermore, the results indicated that the integrated architecture could alleviate the error propagation problem.",2020.0,2020-05-28 00:00:00,5,19,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a37bc8e795c71dff4dc734bcb855df24b8120c5b

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has shown promising performance in tackling feature selection problems, but still faces challenges in dealing with large-scale feature selection in Big Data environment because of the large search space. Hence, this article proposes a bi-directional feature fixation (BDFF) framework for PSO and provides a novel idea to reduce the search space in large-scale feature selection. BDFF uses two opposite search directions to guide particles to adequately search for feature subsets with different sizes. Based on the two different search directions, BDFF can fix the selection states of some features and then focus on the others when updating particles, thus narrowing the large search space. Besides, a self-adaptive strategy is designed to help the swarm concentrate on a more promising direction for search in different stages of evolution and achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation.

10.37547/tajet/volume06issue12-11,PREDICTIVE MODELING OF HOUSEHOLD ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE USA: THE ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS,"Understanding the pattern of energy use at the household level becomes ever more urgent in light of growing concerns about climate change and resource sustainability in the USA. Energy use depends upon various factors, such as climate, household characteristics, and behavior. Of these, income, education, and size of the family are very vital socio-economic factors that depict energy consumption levels and their pattern. The utmost objective of this research project was to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to analyze household energy consumption trends in the USA, integrating socioeconomic factors such as income, family size, and education. The dataset retrieved from Kaggle integrates detailed weather patterns with energy consumption data, putting into perspective the interaction between climatic variables and household energy use. It included key features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, along with time-series data on energy consumption metrics like electricity and natural gas usage at the household level. It provided information on several geographic zones across extended periods, so seasonality and regional variations may be studied. It was complemented with metadata that included timestamps, energy pricing, and household attributes and should therefore be a rich resource for predictive modeling and extracting relationships between weather conditions and energy demand. For this research project, three models were selected: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, each possessing particular strengths for the nature of the problem. This study employed key performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy. The Random Forest model had the highest value for accuracy, similarly, the highest AUC was for the Random Forest with the best AUC. As such, it was concluded that the Random Forest model provided the best trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate and can be relied upon for this classification task. The machine learning models generate valuable predictions about household energy use. Particularly, Random Forest models, which are trained on socioeconomic and weather data to predict the likelihood of a given household having high energy usage. The predictions by such models can be used to help energy providers determine when to invoke tiered pricing or encourage energy-saving behavior.",2024.0,2024-12-19 00:00:00,9,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cec9e1750136270444db39d6a5279ae48ffaf28

We intended to investigate nonlinear relationships typical of the atmospheric variables using state-of-the-art ML methods for more accurate rainfall predictions. For this research project on rainfall forecasting in the USA, we utilized an extensive dataset that comprises historical rainfall data collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other meteorological agencies. The main dataset we use in this paper consists of daily rainfall measurements across various geographical locations of the USA, thus capturing the wide-ranging historical data necessary for both training and validation of the model. Besides measuring rainfall, we included meteorological data from sources such as NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications. These datasets further provided key variables that are known to affect rain, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The performance metrics used in this research work for the models considered include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The above table shows that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other models, achieving perfect accuracy. That indicated that it rightly classified all the instances in the test set. The Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models gave a quite good performance by giving above average accuracy but had lower precision and recall for the rainfall prediction. Accurate rainfall forecasting has direct consequences on agriculture, greatly empowering farmers and agricultural planners to make more effective decisions regarding planting, harvesting, and crop management. The forecasts of rainfall are also of critical importance in disaster management regarding planning for flood emergencies. Moreover, precise forecasting of rainfall, particularly in sustainable water resources management, presents the most important data in planning for and conserving these resources.",2024.0,2024-11-09 00:00:00,7,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfca42eafdd857b52a16778a31b49e35e1b7e353

10.1088/1361-6560/aca512,Incorporating cross-voxel exchange for the analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging data: pre-clinical results,"Tumours exhibit abnormal interstitial structures and vasculature function often leading to impaired and heterogeneous drug delivery. The disproportionate spatial accumulation of a drug in the interstitium is determined by several microenvironmental properties (blood vessel distribution and permeability, gradients in the interstitial fluid pressure). Predictions of tumour perfusion are key determinants of drug delivery and responsiveness to therapy. Pharmacokinetic models allow for the quantification of tracer perfusion based on contrast enhancement measured with non-invasive imaging techniques. An advanced cross-voxel exchange model (CVXM) was recently developed to provide a comprehensive description of tracer extravasation as well as advection and diffusion based on cross-voxel tracer kinetics (Sinno et al 2021). Transport parameters were derived from DCE-MRI of twenty TS-415 human cervical carcinoma xenografts by using CVXM. Tracer velocity flows were measured at the tumour periphery (mean 1.78–5.82 μm.s−1) pushing the contrast outward towards normal tissue. These elevated velocity measures and extravasation rates explain the heterogeneous distribution of tracer across the tumour and its accumulation at the periphery. Significant values for diffusivity were deduced across the tumours (mean 152–499 μm2.s−1). CVXM resulted in generally smaller values for the extravasation parameter Kext (mean 0.01–0.04 min−1) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction ve (mean 0.05–0.17) compared to the standard Tofts parameters, suggesting that Toft model underestimates the effects of inter-voxel exchange. The ratio of Tofts’ extravasation parameters over CVXM’s was significantly positively correlated to the cross-voxel diffusivity (P < 0.0001) and velocity (P = 0.0005). Tofts’ increased ve measurements were explained using Sinno et al (2021)’s theoretical work. Finally, a scan time of 15 min renders informative estimations of the transport parameters. However, a duration as low as 7.5 min is acceptable to recognize the spatial variation of transport parameters. The results demonstrate the potential of utilizing CVXM for determining metrics characterizing the exchange of tracer between the vasculature and the tumour tissue. Like for many earlier models, additional work is strongly recommended, in terms of validation, to develop more confidence in the results, motivating future laboratory work in this regard.",2022.0,2022-11-22 00:00:00,2,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f8cf015f31b5bcd7e5c9e143ebd7bcf132982f5

Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects; while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body’s immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data; predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.",2021.0,2021-05-26 00:00:00,173,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1497e7ef43447f01ffb42240ad8b29825526b4c0

10.3390/math11020372,Feature Map Regularized CycleGAN for Domain Transfer,"CycleGAN domain transfer architectures use cycle consistency loss mechanisms to enforce the bijectivity of highly underconstrained domain transfer mapping. In this paper, in order to further constrain the mapping problem and reinforce the cycle consistency between two domains, we also introduce a novel regularization method based on the alignment of feature maps probability distributions. This type of optimization constraint, expressed via an additional loss function, allows for further reducing the size of the regions that are mapped from the source domain into the same image in the target domain, which leads to mapping closer to the bijective and thus better performance. By selecting feature maps of the network layers with the same depth d in the encoder of the direct generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the decoder of the inverse GAN, it is possible to describe their d-dimensional probability distributions and, through novel regularization term, enforce similarity between representations of the same image in both domains during the mapping cycle. We introduce several ground distances between Gaussian distributions of the corresponding feature maps used in the regularization. In the experiments conducted on several real datasets, we achieved better performance in the unsupervised image transfer task in comparison to the baseline CycleGAN, and obtained results that were much closer to the fully supervised pix2pix method for all used datasets. The PSNR measure of the proposed method was, on average, 4.7% closer to the results of the pix2pix method in comparison to the baseline CycleGAN over all datasets. This also held for SSIM, where the described percentage was 8.3% on average over all datasets.",2023.0,2023-01-10 00:00:00,4,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60ddeb6ef659cba30d4c63aefab971a2b96d9582

10.3390/app12073411,Bootstrapped SSL CycleGAN for Asymmetric Domain Transfer,"Most CycleGAN domain transfer architectures require a large amount of data belonging to domains on which the domain transfer task is to be applied. Nevertheless, in many real-world applications one of the domains is reduced, i.e., scarce. This means that it has much less training data available in comparison to the other domain, which is fully observable. In order to tackle the problem of using CycleGAN framework in such unfavorable application scenarios, we propose and invoke a novel Bootstrapped SSL CycleGAN architecture (BTS-SSL), where the mentioned problem is overcome using two strategies. Firstly, by using a relatively small percentage of available labelled training data from the reduced or scarce domain and a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach, we prevent overfitting of the discriminator belonging to the reduced domain, which would otherwise occur during initial training iterations due to the small amount of available training data in the scarce domain. Secondly, after initial learning guided by the described SSL strategy, additional bootstrapping (BTS) of the reduced data domain is performed by inserting artifically generated training examples into the training poll of the data discriminator belonging to the scarce domain. Bootstrapped samples are generated by the already trained neural network that performs transferring from the fully observable to the scarce domain. The described procedure is periodically repeated during the training process several times and results in significantly improved performance of the final model in comparison to the original unsupervised CycleGAN approach. The same also holds in comparison to the solutions that are exclusively based either on the described SSL, or on the bootstrapping strategy, i.e., when these are applied separately. Moreover, in the considered scarce scenarios it also shows competitive results in comparison to the fully supervised solution based on the pix2pix method. In that sense, it is directly applicable to many domain transfer tasks that are relying on the CycleGAN architecture.",2022.0,2022-03-27 00:00:00,3,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a850dc63f00f4a16c5535ac6a658df41811904ad

Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3D printing community.",2015.0,2015-08-30 00:00:00,35,41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80cb0bd38a588c2dfb42f1af8684b62f20476f21

Plant diseases and pests are considered one of the most imperative factors influencing food production, quality, and minimize losses in production. Farmers are currently facing difficulty in identifying various plant diseases and pests, which are important to prevent plant diseases effectively in a complicated environment. The recent development of deep learning techniques has found use in the diagnosis of plant diseases and pests, providing a robust tool with highly accurate results. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature that aims to identify the state of the art of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the process of diagnosing and identification of plant pest and diseases. In addition, it presents some issues that are facing the models performance, and also indicates gaps that should be addressed in the future. In this regard, we review studies with various methods that addressed plant disease detection, dataset characteristics, the crops, and pathogens. Moreover, it discusses the commonly employed five-step methodology for plant disease recognition, involving data acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. It discusses various deep learning architecture-based solutions that have a faster convergence rate of plant disease recognition. From this review, it is possible to understand the innovative trends regarding the use of CNN’s algorithms in the plant diseases diagnosis and to recognize the gaps that need the attention of the research community.",2023.0,2023-02-02 00:00:00,9,53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a950057affdf14740bf843e3d760768758b41f11
10.1109/TCCN.2022.3186331,A Flow-Based Anomaly Detection Approach With Feature Selection Method Against DDoS Attacks in SDNs,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network platform, which facilitates centralised network management. The SDN enables the network operators to manage the overall network consistently and holistically, regardless the complexity of infrastructure devices. The promising features of the SDN enhance network security and facilitate the implementation of threat detection systems through software applications using open APIs. However, the emerging technology creates new security concerns and new threats that do not exist in the current traditional networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) are one of the most rampant attacks that can interrupt the functionality of the network and make most of the network services unreachable for network users. The efficient identification of DDos attacks on SDN environments in literature is still a challenge because of the number of network features taken into account and the overhead of applying machine learning based anomaly detection techniques. Hence, in this paper, we aim to use two popular feature selection methods, i.e., Information Gain (IG) and Random Forest (RF) in order to analyse the most comprehensive relevant features of DDoS attacks in SDN networks. Using the most relevant features will improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection system and reduce the false alarm rates. Moreover, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) technique based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoencoder to tackle the problem of DDoS attacks in SDNs. We perform our analysis and evaluation on three different datasets, i.e., InSDN, CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018. We also measure the overhead of the proposed DL model on the SDN controller and test the network performance in terms of network throughput and end-to-end latency. The results validate that the DL approach can efficiently identify DDoS attacks in SDN environments without any significant degradation in the controller performance.",2022.0,2022-12-01 00:00:00,82,71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4630c79434b4fd4511b9a272029af7996d37834e

10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3376670,A Novel Offloading Mechanism Leveraging Fuzzy Logic and Deep Reinforcement Learning to Improve IoT Application Performance in a Three-Layer Architecture Within the Fog-Cloud Environment,"This paper presents a novel offloading technique designed to enhance the efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) applications within a sophisticated three-layer architecture situated in a fog computing environment. The IoT layer contains various intelligent IoT devices that generate a large number of tasks, each characterized by distinct specifications such as size, computational demand, communication requirements, and latency constraints. owing to the limited storage and computing capacity of resource-constrained IoT devices, it is essential to offload these tasks to different layers to ensure effective processing while satisfying the required Quality of Service (QoS) goals. To address this challenge, a fuzzy logic-based task scheduler is employed to make informed offloading decisions, considering task attributes and determining the most suitable processing layers—whether locally at the IoT layer, on collaborative fog nodes, or in the cloud. Furthermore, the study leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) method, a form of deep reinforcement learning, to identify the optimal fog node for offloading tasks and to maintain a balanced workload distribution across collaborative fog nodes. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of latency, power consumption, network usage, throughput, and offloading rate in comparison with the Non-offload, First-Fit, GASDEO, and NAFITO-FLA methods.",2024.0,,14,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/237f834c75b54f0944f7f653b3b97ce91833d3c6

10.3390/s23031392,A Hybrid Generic Framework for Heart Problem Diagnosis Based on a Machine Learning Paradigm,"The early, valid prediction of heart problems would minimize life threats and save lives, while lack of prediction and false diagnosis can be fatal. Addressing a single dataset alone to build a machine learning model for the identification of heart problems is not practical because each country and hospital has its own data schema, structure, and quality. On this basis, a generic framework has been built for heart problem diagnosis. This framework is a hybrid framework that employs multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques and votes for the best outcome based on a novel voting technique with the intention to remove bias from the model. The framework contains two consequent layers. The first layer contains simultaneous machine learning models running over a given dataset. The second layer consolidates the outputs of the first layer and classifies them as a second classification layer based on novel voting techniques. Prior to the classification process, the framework selects the top features using a proposed feature selection framework. It starts by filtering the columns using multiple feature selection methods and considers the top common features selected. Results from the proposed framework, with 95.6% accuracy, show its superiority over the single machine learning model, classical stacking technique, and traditional voting technique. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate how the prediction probabilities of multiple models can be exploited for the purpose of creating another layer for final output; this step neutralizes any model bias. Another experimental contribution is proving the complete pipeline’s ability to be retrained and used for other datasets collected using different measurements and with different distributions.",2023.0,2023-01-26 00:00:00,15,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b1c4f516f5b669b16848797f0608d3b76f79ef0

We tackle the challenge of finding a closed-loop control policy to optimally schedule the operation of a storage device, in order to maximize self-consumption of local photovoltaic production in a microgrid. In this work, the fitted Q-iteration algorithm, a standard batch RL technique, is used by an RL agent to construct a control policy. The proposed method is data-driven and uses a state-action value function to find an optimal scheduling plan for a battery. The battery’s charge and discharge efficiencies, and the nonlinearity in the microgrid due to the inverter’s efficiency are taken into account. The proposed approach has been tested by simulation in a residential setting using data from Belgian residential consumers. The developed framework is benchmarked with a model-based technique, and the simulation results show a performance gap of 19%.

This paper presents a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) self-tuning temperature sensing and control system for efficiently modulating the temperature environment within a multi-module instrument. The smart system ensures that the internal temperature of the instrument converges to a target without the need of a system model, thus making the control robust. The system consists of a fully-connected proportional–integral–derivative (PID) neural network (FCPIDNN) and an on-line self-tuning module. The experimental results show that the presented system can effectively control the internal temperature under various mission scenarios, in particular, it is able to self-reconfigure upon actuator failure.

It advances dynamic resource allocation and power management. This study employs deep neural networks including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) techniques to one-hour-ahead forecast the volume of expected traffic and compares this approach to other methods including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). The deep neural network implementation in this study analyses, evaluates and generates predictions based on the data of telecommunications activity every one hour, continuously in one year, released by Viettel Telecom in Vietnam. The performance indexes, including RMSE, MAPE, MAE, R and Theil’s U are used to make comparison of the developed models. The obtained results show that both LSTM and GRU model outperformed the ANFIS, ANN and GMDH models.

This result indicates the possibility that BERT networks capture structural information about language. In this work, we provide novel support for this claim by performing a series of experiments to unpack the elements of English language structure learned by BERT. Our findings are fourfold. BERT’s phrasal representation captures the phrase-level information in the lower layers. The intermediate layers of BERT compose a rich hierarchy of linguistic information, starting with surface features at the bottom, syntactic features in the middle followed by semantic features at the top. BERT requires deeper layers while tracking subject-verb agreement to handle long-term dependency problem.

10.5220/0010215303190328,Explainable Sentiment Analysis Application for Social Media Crisis Management in Retail,"Sentiment Analysis techniques enable the automatic extraction of sentiment in social media data, including popular platforms as Twitter. For retailers and marketing analysts, such methods can support the understanding of customers' attitudes towards brands, especially to handle crises that cause behavioural changes in customers, including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the increasing adoption of black-box machine learning-based techniques, transparency becomes a need for those stakeholders to understand why a given sentiment is predicted, which is rarely explored for retailers facing social media crises. This study develops an Explainable Sentiment Analysis (XSA) application for Twitter data, and proposes research propositions focused on evaluating such application in a hypothetical crisis management scenario. Particularly, we evaluate, through discussions and a simulated user experiment, the XSA support for understanding customer's needs, as well as if marketing analysts would trust such an application for their decision-making processes. Results illustrate the XSA application can be effective in providing the most important words addressing customers sentiment out of individual tweets, as well as the potential to foster analysts' confidence in such support.

This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the development of theoretical models in the area of social media crisis communication and management. The study aims to review and analyse the relationship of social media-based crisis communication in the context of crisis informatics and its taxonomy and the related crisis communication theoretical models to derive the challenges and limitations. A total of 207 articles were selected for the evaluation based on quality, relevancy, and contribution. The findings revealed that the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) is the most dominant theory, followed by social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) and integrated crisis mapping (ICM) models. The study identified theories such as the STREMII model, social media crisis management matrix/framework (SMSMF), and an interactive crisis communication model (ICCM) as emerging models.

In parallel, a method to optimize the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of PET detectors by use of the DOI information is proposed and tested. For these purposes, a dedicated 64-channels readout setup has been developed with intrinsic timing resolution of 16 ps FWHM. Several PET modules have been produced, based on LYSO:Ce scintillators and commercial silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays, with mm2 individual SiPM size. The results show the possibility to achieve a timing resolution of 157 ps FWHM, combined with the already demonstrated spatial resolution of 1.5 mm FWHM, DOI resolution of 3 mm FWHM, and energy resolution of 9% FWHM at 511 keV, with 15 mm long crystals of section mm2 and mm2.

Monoliths provide good energy, timing, and spatial resolution including intrinsic depth of interaction (DOI) encoding. DOI allows reducing parallax errors (radial astigmatism) at off-center positions within a PET ring. We present a novel DOI-estimation approach based on the supervised machine learning algorithm gradient tree boosting (GTB). GTB builds predictive regression models based on sequential binary comparisons (decision trees). GTB models have been shown to be implementable in FPGA if the memory requirement fits the available resources. We propose two optimization scenarios for the best possible positioning performance: One restricting the available memory to enable a future FPGA implementation and one without any restrictions. The positioning performance of the GTB models is compared with a DOI estimation method based on a single DOI observable (SO) comparable to other methods presented in literature. For a 12 mm high monolith, we achieve an averaged spatial resolution of 2.15 mm and 2.12 mm FWHM for SO and GTB models, respectively. In contrast to SO models, GTB models show a nearly uniform positioning performance over the whole crystal depth.",2018.0,2018-08-20 00:00:00,68,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af3e9d8282e34f6eed148d30eb9032855d59b312
10.1002/mp.12906,"An edge‐readout, multilayer detector for positron emission tomography","Purpose We present a novel gamma‐ray‐detector design based on total internal reflection (TIR) of scintillation photons within a crystal that addresses many limitations of traditional PET detectors. Our approach has appealing features, including submillimeter lateral resolution, DOI positioning from layer thickness, and excellent energy resolution. The design places light sensors on the edges of a stack of scintillator slabs separated by small air gaps and exploits the phenomenon that more than 80% of scintillation light emitted during a gamma‐ray event reaches the edges of a thin crystal with polished faces due to TIR. Gamma‐ray stopping power is achieved by stacking multiple layers, and DOI is determined by which layer the gamma ray interacts in. Method The concept of edge readouts of a thin slab was verified by Monte Carlo simulation of scintillation light transport. An LYSO crystal of dimensions 50.8 mm × 50.8 mm × 3.0 mm was modeled with five rectangular SiPMs placed along each edge face. The mean‐detector‐response functions (MDRFs) were calculated by simulating signals from 511 keV gamma‐ray interactions in a grid of locations. Simulations were carried out to study the influence of choice of scintillator material and dimensions, gamma‐ray photon energies, introduction of laser or mechanically induced optical barriers (LIOBs, MIOBs), and refractive indices of optical‐coupling media and SiPM windows. We also analyzed timing performance including influence of gamma‐ray interaction position and presence of optical barriers. We also modeled and built a prototype detector, a 27.4 mm × 27.4 mm × 3.0 mm CsI(Tl) crystal with 4 SiPMs per edge to experimentally validate the results predicted by the simulations. The prototype detector used CsI(Tl) crystals from Proteus outfitted with 16 Hamamatsu model S13360‐6050PE MPPCs read out by an AiT‐16‐channel readout. The MDRFs were measured by scanning the detector with a collimated beam of 662‐keV photons from a 137Cs source. The spatial resolution was experimentally determined by imaging a tungsten slit that created a beam of 0.44 mm (FWHM) width normal to the detector surface. The energy resolution was evaluated by analyzing list‐mode data from flood illumination by the 137Cs source. Result We find that in a block‐detector‐sized LYSO layer read out by five SiPMs per edge, illuminated by 511‐keV photons, the average resolution is 1.49 mm (FWHM). With the introduction of optical barriers, average spatial resolution improves to 0.56 mm (FWHM). The DOI resolution is the layer thickness of 3.0 mm. We also find that optical‐coupling media and SiPM‐window materials have an impact on spatial resolution. The timing simulation with LYSO crystal yields a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of 200–400 ps, which is slightly position dependent. And the introduction of optical barriers has minimum influence. The prototype CsI(Tl) detector, with a smaller area and fewer SiPMs, was measured to have central‐area spatial resolutions of 0.70 and 0.39 mm without and with optical barriers, respectively. These results match well with our simulations. An energy resolution of 6.4% was achieved at 662 keV. Conclusion A detector design based on a stack of monolithic scintillator layers that uses edge readouts offers several advantages over current block detectors for PET.

Here we apply machine learning methods of support vector machine and convolutional neural network to train models using element compositions of surface sediments from eight potential source regions, accordingly, to determine the dust sources and contributions by classifying the last glacial loess and present interglacial sediments on the CLP. The trained models succeed in differentiating major secondary sources and quantitatively estimating the contributions of both primary and secondary sources at least during the last glacial‐interglacial cycle. The understanding that a constant dust source despite changing climate conditions agrees with those derived from Sr‐Nd isotopes and U‐Pb age spectra.

10.1130/geol.s.12777605.v1,Stagnant slab front within the mantle transition zone controls the formation of Cenozoic intracontinental high-Mg andesites in northeast Asia,"
 The geochemistry of Cenozoic intracontinental high-Mg andesites (HMAs) in northeast Asia, together with regional geophysical data, offers an opportunity to explore the genetic relationship between the formation of intracontinental HMAs and subduction of the Pacific plate. Compared with primary HMAs in arcs, Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia have lower Mg# [100 × Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)] values (53–56) and CaO contents (5.8–6.6 wt%), higher alkali (Na2O + K2O) contents (5.15–6.45 wt%), and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7056–0.7059; εNd = −4.9 to −3.4; εHf = −4.7 to −2.6) as well as lower Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb = 16.76–19.19; 207Pb/204Pb = 15.42–15.45; 208Pb/204Pb = 36.71–37.11). These Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs are similar to Cenozoic potassic basalts in northeast China with respect to their Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions but have higher SiO2 and Al2O3 contents and lower K2O, MgO, and light rare earth element contents. These features indicate that these Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs originated from the mantle, where recycled ancient sediments and water contributed to partial melting of peridotite. Combined with the presence of a large low-resistivity anomaly derived from the mantle transition zone (MTZ) near these intracontinental HMAs, and their occurrence above the stagnant slab front within the MTZ (at 600 km depth) in northeast Asia, we conclude that the stagnant slab front, with high contents of recycled ancient sediments and water, has controlled the formation of Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia.",2020.0,2020-08-07 00:00:00,28,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66321fdb93bf434ec9c06ee861babb5ade224052

A rigorous approach to observational studies involves collecting data from different sensors to comprehensively capture the situation of the subject. However, this leads to technical difficulties especially if the sensors are from different manufacturers, as multiple data collection tools have to run simultaneously. We present SensorHub, a system that can collect data from various wearable devices from different manufacturers, such as inertial measurement units, portable electrocardiographs, portable electroencephalographs, portable photoplethysmographs, and sensors for electrodermal activity. Additionally, our tool offers the possibility to include ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in studies. Hence, SensorHub enables multimodal sensor data collection under real-world conditions and allows direct user feedback to be collected through questionnaires, enabling studies at home. In a first study with 11 participants, we successfully used SensorHub to record multiple signals with different devices and collected additional information with the help of EMAs. In addition, we evaluated SensorHub’s technical capabilities in several trials with up to 21 participants recording simultaneously using multiple sensors with sampling frequencies as high as 1000 Hz. We could show that although there is a theoretical limitation to the transmissible data rate, in practice this limitation is not an issue and data loss is rare. We conclude that with modern communication protocols and with the increasingly powerful smartphones and wearables, a system like our SensorHub establishes an interoperability framework to adequately combine consumer-grade sensing hardware which enables observational studies in real life.",2022.0,2022-01-01 00:00:00,9,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c755a82f0bf7d2495dc890bedf631d4fa8b896b

In particular, physiological signals are widely used to detect and classify affective states in lab conditions. However, physiological reactions to emotional stimuli have been found to differ in laboratory and natural settings. Thanks to recent technological progress (e.g., in wearables) the creation of EMSR systems for a large number of consumers during their everyday activities is increasingly possible. Therefore, datasets created in the wild are needed to insure the validity and the exploitability of EMSR models for real-life applications. In this paper, we initially present common techniques used in laboratory settings to induce emotions for the purpose of physiological dataset creation. Next, advantages and challenges of data collection in the wild are discussed. To assess the applicability of existing datasets to real-life applications, we propose a set of categories to guide and compare at a glance different methodologies used by researchers to collect such data. For this purpose, we also introduce a visual tool called Graphical Assessment of Real-life Application-Focused Emotional Dataset (GARAFED). In the last part of the paper, we apply the proposed tool to compare existing physiological datasets for EMSR in the wild and to show possible improvements and future directions of research. We wish for this paper and GARAFED to be used as guidelines for researchers and developers who aim at collecting affect-related data for real-life EMSR-based applications.",2020.0,2020-07-15 00:00:00,82,180,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7649125c1f7299e32dffc1856b899b0b793736bf

10.3390/info13060303,LoRaWAN Based Indoor Localization Using Random Neural Networks,"Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are frequently used as a potential solution for localization applications. However, GPS does not work indoors due to a lack of direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) satellite signals received from the End Device (ED) due to thick solid materials blocking the ultra-high frequency signals. Furthermore, fingerprint localization using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values is typical for localization in indoor environments. Therefore, this paper develops a low-power intelligent localization system for indoor environments using Long-Range Wide-Area Networks (LoRaWAN) RSSI values with Random Neural Networks (RNN). The proposed localization system demonstrates 98.5% improvement in average localization error compared to related studies with a minimum average localization error of 0.12 m in the Line-of-Sight (LOS). The obtained results confirm LoRaWAN-RNN-based localization systems suitable for indoor environments in LOS applied in big sports halls, hospital wards, shopping malls, airports, and many more with the highest accuracy of 99.52%. Furthermore, a minimum average localization error of 13.94 m was obtained in the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenario, and this result is appropriate for the management and control of vehicles in indoor car parks, industries, or any other fleet in a pre-defined area in the NLOS with the highest accuracy of 44.24%.",2022.0,2022-06-16 00:00:00,14,23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b8596728aebc1f5ae0bf3c5a0186e04116e3b620

In this paper, we present printed sensor antennas for the [862–928] MHz band supporting LoRa and Sigfox and the [2.4–2.5] GHz band for WiFi, Bluetooth, and IEEE802.15.4 communication. To integrate them into smart suitcases, the antennas are printed, overmolded, tested, and measured, following a dedicated conformal integration strategy consisting of two design iterations. Additionally, as a more convenient connection to the printed antennas, printed transmission lines along with a dedicated transition to printed circuit board technologies are implemented and characterized, avoiding rigid coaxial connectors that exhibit fragile mounting on flexible substrates. The overmolded stand-alone antennas achieve fractional impedance bandwidths of 26% and 15% covering the [862–928] MHz and [2.4–2.5] GHz bands, respectively, with a substantial margin and with in-band simulated total efficiencies of 94% and 88%, respectively.

Our method combines a unique problem representation and an unbiased optimization protocol to learn from mirBase19.0 an accurate predictive model, termed MiRduplexSVM. This is the first model that provides precise information about all four ends of the miRNA duplex. We show that (a) our method outperforms four state-of-the-art tools, namely MaturePred, MiRPara, MatureBayes, MiRdup as well as a Simple Geometric Locator when applied on the same training datasets employed for each tool and evaluated on a common blind test set. (b) In all comparisons, MiRduplexSVM shows superior performance, achieving up to a 60% increase in prediction accuracy for mammalian hairpins and can generalize very well on plant hairpins, without any special optimization. (c) The tool has a number of important applications such as the ability to accurately predict the miRNA or the miRNA*, given the opposite strand of a duplex. Its performance on this task is superior to the 2nts overhang rule commonly used in computational studies and similar to that of a comparative genomic approach, without the need for prior knowledge or the complexity of performing multiple alignments. Finally, it is able to evaluate novel, potential miRNAs found either computationally or experimentally.

10.1093/nar/gkt466,Computational prediction of the localization of microRNAs within their pre-miRNA,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA species derived from hairpin-forming miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) and acting as key posttranscriptional regulators. Most computational tools labeled as miRNA predictors are in fact pre-miRNA predictors and provide no information about the putative miRNA location within the pre-miRNA. Sequence and structural features that determine the location of the miRNA, and the extent to which these properties vary from species to species, are poorly understood. We have developed miRdup, a computational predictor for the identification of the most likely miRNA location within a given pre-miRNA or the validation of a candidate miRNA. MiRdup is based on a random forest classifier trained with experimentally validated miRNAs from miRbase, with features that characterize the miRNA–miRNA* duplex. Because we observed that miRNAs have sequence and structural properties that differ between species, mostly in terms of duplex stability, we trained various clade-specific miRdup models and obtained increased accuracy. MiRdup self-trains on the most recent version of miRbase and is easy to use. Combined with existing pre-miRNA predictors, it will be valuable for both de novo mapping of miRNAs and filtering of large sets of candidate miRNAs obtained from transcriptome sequencing projects. MiRdup is open source under the GPLv3 and available at http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/∼blanchem/mirdup/.",2013.0,2013-06-08 00:00:00,63,94,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8716037bf581f6f0405c6f0141b579258801f508
10.18632/oncotarget.27617,Profiling the circulating mRNA transcriptome in human liver disease,"The human circulation contains cell-free DNA and non-coding microRNA (miRNA). Less is known about the presence of messenger RNA (mRNA). This report profiles the human circulating mRNA transcriptome in people with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to determine whether mRNA analytes can be used as biomarkers of liver disease. Using RNAseq and RT-qPCR, we investigate circulating mRNA in plasma from HCC and LC patients and demonstrate detection of transcripts representing more than 19,000 different protein coding genes. Remarkably, the circulating mRNA expression levels were similar from person to person over the 21 individuals whose samples were analyzed by RNAseq. Liver derived circulating transcripts such as albumin (ALB), apolipoprotein (APO) A1, A2 & H, serpin A1 & E1, ferritin light chain (FTL) and fibrinogen like 1 (FGL1) were significantly upregulated in HCC patient samples. Higher levels of some of these liver-specific transcripts in the plasma of HCC patients were confirmed by RT-qPCR in another cohort of 20 individuals. Several less abundant circulating transcripts associated with cancer were detected in most HCC samples, but not in healthy subjects. Liver specificity of circulating transcripts was confirmed by investigating their expression in HCC tumor and liver cancer cell lines. Liver specific mRNA sequences in the plasma were predominantly present outside circulating extracellular vesicles. Conclusions: The circulating “mRNA” transcriptome is remarkably consistent in diversity and expression from person to person. Detection of transcripts corresponding to disease selective polypeptides suggests the possibility that circulating mRNA can work as a biomarker analyte for cancer detection.",2020.0,2020-06-09 00:00:00,15,53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f52e07618c6788c075897d18417992bc5eb78b37
10.3390/cancers12020392,Immunomodulatory Roles of PARP-1 and PARP-2: Impact on PARP-Centered Cancer Therapies,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2 are enzymes which post-translationally modify proteins through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation)—the transfer of ADP-ribose chains onto amino acid residues—with a resultant modulation of protein function. Many targets of PARP-1/2-dependent PARylation are involved in the DNA damage response and hence, the loss of these proteins disrupts a wide range of biological processes, from DNA repair and epigenetics to telomere and centromere regulation. The central role of these PARPs in DNA metabolism in cancer cells has led to the development of PARP inhibitors as new cancer therapeutics, both as adjuvant treatment potentiating chemo-, radio-, and immuno-therapies and as monotherapy exploiting cancer-specific defects in DNA repair. However, a cancer is not just made up of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment also includes multiple other cell types, particularly stromal and immune cells. Interactions between these cells—cancerous and non-cancerous—are known to either favor or limit tumorigenesis. In recent years, an important role of PARP-1 and PARP-2 has been demonstrated in different aspects of the immune response, modulating both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is now emerging that PARP-1 and PARP-2 may not only impact cancer cell biology, but also modulate the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the immunomodulatory roles of PARP-1 and PARP-2 may provide invaluable clues to the rational development of more selective PARP-centered therapies which target both the cancer and its microenvironment.",2020.0,2020-02-01 00:00:00,56,104,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fec9e1e31cae4fe5f17ec2a08b83ebb8f066dd29

Complex interactions between tumor cells, lymphocytes and the tumor environment determine the efficacy of such immunotherapies. Innate immune mechanisms – known drivers of liver disease progression in pre-HCC conditions such as fibrosis or cirrhosis – may either support or counteract tumor-related immune activation.

10.3390/s18020416,Facial Emotion Recognition: A Survey and Real-World User Experiences in Mixed Reality,"Extensive possibilities of applications have made emotion recognition ineluctable and challenging in the field of computer science. The use of non-verbal cues such as gestures, body movement, and facial expressions convey the feeling and the feedback to the user. This discipline of Human–Computer Interaction places reliance on the algorithmic robustness and the sensitivity of the sensor to ameliorate the recognition. Sensors play a significant role in accurate detection by providing a very high-quality input, hence increasing the efficiency and the reliability of the system. Automatic recognition of human emotions would help in teaching social intelligence in the machines. This paper presents a brief study of the various approaches and the techniques of emotion recognition. The survey covers a succinct review of the databases that are considered as data sets for algorithms detecting the emotions by facial expressions. Later, mixed reality device Microsoft HoloLens (MHL) is introduced for observing emotion recognition in Augmented Reality (AR). A brief introduction of its sensors, their application in emotion recognition and some preliminary results of emotion recognition using MHL are presented. The paper then concludes by comparing results of emotion recognition by the MHL and a regular webcam.",2018.0,2018-02-01 00:00:00,134,73,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41de109bca9343691f1d5720df864cdbeeecd9d0

Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG “combo” pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting “clean” PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment.

10.1055/s-0041-1731390,Semantic Textual Similarity in Japanese Clinical Domain Texts Using BERT,"Abstract Background Semantic textual similarity (STS) captures the degree of semantic similarity between texts. It plays an important role in many natural language processing applications such as text summarization, question answering, machine translation, information retrieval, dialog systems, plagiarism detection, and query ranking. STS has been widely studied in the general English domain. However, there exists few resources for STS tasks in the clinical domain and in languages other than English, such as Japanese. Objective The objective of this study is to capture semantic similarity between Japanese clinical texts (Japanese clinical STS) by creating a Japanese dataset that is publicly available. Materials We created two datasets for Japanese clinical STS: (1) Japanese case reports (CR dataset) and (2) Japanese electronic medical records (EMR dataset). The CR dataset was created from publicly available case reports extracted from the CiNii database. The EMR dataset was created from Japanese electronic medical records. Methods We used an approach based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to capture the semantic similarity between the clinical domain texts. BERT is a popular approach for transfer learning and has been proven to be effective in achieving high accuracy for small datasets. We implemented two Japanese pretrained BERT models: a general Japanese BERT and a clinical Japanese BERT. The general Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese Wikipedia texts while the clinical Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese clinical texts. Results The BERT models performed well in capturing semantic similarity in our datasets. The general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT and achieved a high correlation with human score (0.904 in the CR dataset and 0.875 in the EMR dataset). It was unexpected that the general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT on clinical domain dataset. This could be due to the fact that the general Japanese BERT is pretrained on a wide range of texts compared with the clinical Japanese BERT.",2021.0,2021-06-01 00:00:00,24,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70ffcb07856768ea2ba0766f841459fb8fc10b87

Although multilingual LMs were also introduced to serve many languages, these have limitations such as being costly at inference time and the size and diversity of non-English data involved in their pre-training. We remedy these issues for a collection of diverse Arabic varieties by introducing two powerful deep bidirectional transformer-based models, ARBERT and MARBERT. To evaluate our models, we also introduce ARLUE, a new benchmark for multi-dialectal Arabic language understanding evaluation. ARLUE is built using 42 datasets targeting six different task clusters, allowing us to offer a series of standardized experiments under rich conditions. When fine-tuned on ARLUE, our models collectively achieve new state-of-the-art results across the majority of tasks (37 out of 48 classification tasks, on the 42 datasets). Our best model acquires the highest ARLUE score (77.40) across all six task clusters, outperforming all other models including XLM-R Large ( 3.4x larger size). Our models are publicly available at https://github.com/UBC-NLP/marbert and ARLUE will be released through the same repository.",2020.0,2020-12-27 00:00:00,427,110,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e4cda8be54999ced1324777fa462a85e2c9746c

We also calculated and obtained the dVMHC value between the cerebral cortexes. Results Compared with the normal control group, the dVMHC of the lingual gyrus (Ling) and the calcarine sulcus (CAL), which represented the visual network (VN), increased significantly in the asthma group, while the dVMHC of the medial superior frontal gyrus (MSFG), the anterior/middle/posterior cingulate gyrus (A/M/PCG), and the supplementary motor area (SMA) of the sensorimotor network decreased significantly in the asthma group. Conclusion This study showed that the ability of emotion regulation and the efficiency of visual and cognitive information processing in patients with BA was lower than in those in the HC group.

This is achieved by combining a quadrupole-based transverse phase-space tomography with the adjustable streaking angle of a polarizable X-band transverse deflection structure. We demonstrate with detailed simulations that the method is able to reconstruct various complex phase-space distributions and that the quality of the reconstruction depends on the number of input projections. This method allows for the identification and visualization of previously unnoticed detailed features in the phase-space distribution and can thereby be used as a tool toward improving the performance of particle accelerators or performing more accurate simulation studies.

10.1093/jbcr/irad051,Clinical Investigation of a Rapid Non-invasive Multispectral Imaging Device Utilizing an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm for Improved Burn Assessment,"Abstract Currently, the incorrect judgment of burn depth remains common even among experienced surgeons. Contributing to this problem are change in burn appearance throughout the first week requiring periodic evaluation until a confident diagnosis can be made. To overcome these issues, we investigated the feasibility of an artificial intelligence algorithm trained with multispectral images of burn injuries to predict burn depth rapidly and accurately, including burns of indeterminate depth. In a feasibility study, 406 multispectral images of burns were collected within 72 hours of injury and then serially for up to 7 days. Simultaneously, the subject’s clinician indicated whether the burn was of indeterminate depth. The final depth of burned regions within images were agreed upon by a panel of burn practitioners using biopsies and 21-day healing assessments as reference standards. We compared three convolutional neural network architectures and an ensemble in their capability to automatically highlight areas of nonhealing burn regions within images. The top algorithm was the ensemble with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 97% positive predictive value (PPV). Its sensitivity and PPV were found to increase in a sigmoid shape during the first week postburn, with the inflection point at day 2.5. Additionally, when burns were labeled as indeterminate, the algorithm’s sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value were: 70%, 100%, 97%, and 100%. These results suggest multispectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence is feasible for detecting nonhealing burn tissue and could play an important role in aiding the earlier diagnosis of indeterminate burns.",2023.0,2023-04-21 00:00:00,5,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c6b6bd82173e835b696a160972e9923ecb3ab47

10.1364/boe.479567,Triage of in vivo burn injuries and prediction of wound healing outcome using neural networks and modeling of the terahertz permittivity based on the double Debye dielectric parameters.,"The initial assessment of the depth of a burn injury during triage forms the basis for determination of the course of the clinical treatment plan. However, severe skin burns are highly dynamic and hard to predict. This results in a low accuracy rate of about 60 - 75% in the diagnosis of partial-thickness burns in the acute post-burn period. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has demonstrated a significant potential for non-invasive and timely estimation of the burn severity. Here, we describe a methodology for the measurement and numerical modeling of the dielectric permittivity of the in vivo porcine skin burns. We use the double Debye dielectric relaxation theory to model the permittivity of the burned tissue. We further investigate the origins of dielectric contrast between the burns of various severity, as determined histologically based on the percentage of the burned dermis, using the empirical Debye parameters. We demonstrate that the five parameters of the double Debye model can form an artificial neural network classification algorithm capable of automatic diagnosis of the severity of the burn injuries, and predicting its ultimate wound healing outcome by forecasting its re-epithelialization status in 28 days. Our results demonstrate that the Debye dielectric parameters provide a physics-based approach for the extraction of the biomedical diagnostic markers from the broadband THz pulses. This method can significantly boost dimensionality reduction of THz training data in artificial intelligence models and streamline machine learning algorithms.",2022.0,2022-12-22 00:00:00,7,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6157a37f3a1103fcedea55a559ecfae17d2709a

VO2max was directly measured on an electromagnetic bicycle ergometer. Using the participant's heart rate in the 3-min incremental step-in-place test and demographic parameters, VO2max prediction models established for four groups were TOG model, NOG model, OVG model, and OBG model, respectively. Compared with the TOG model, the OVG and OBG models had higher coefficients of determination and lower standard error of estimates (SEEs), or %SEEs. The validities of the NOG (r = 0.780), OVG (r = 0.776), and OBG (r = 0.791) models for BMI subgroups increased by 1.79%, 4.64%, and 8.22% respectively, and the reliabilities (NOG model: ICC = 0.755; OVG model: ICC = 0.765; OBG model: ICC = 0.779) increased by 3.18%, 3.27%, and 9.63%, respectively. These results suggested using separate models established in BMI stratifications can effectively improve the prediction of VO2max.",2022.0,2022-10-31 00:00:00,4,52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/053ce79596ea7bdcf63776c642e94f444cb3f97e

The experimental results prove that the reliability and validity of the second-level quantitative load scheme for power vehicles are better and can be used as the maximum oxygen uptake in the laboratory, directly tested with alternative submaximal solutions, and used for large-scale investigation of maximum oxygen uptake data. At the same time, since the load is submaximal, it can also be used to clinically assess the patient’s cardiorespiratory endurance.",2022.0,2022-05-19 00:00:00,2,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e77c900c34072dc0dfbf4f0b10c45bd111208b02

The typical mobile-based HRV device simply records interbeat intervals, without differentiation between noise or arrythmia as can be done with an electrocardiogram (ECG). The intent of this report is to validate a new single channel ECG device, the Movesense Medical sensor, against a conventional 12 channel ECG. A heterogeneous group of 21 participants performed an incremental cycling ramp to failure with measurements of HRV, before (PRE), during (EX), and after (POST). Results showed excellent correlations between devices for linear indexes with Pearson’s r between 0.98 to 1.0 for meanRR, SDNN, RMSSD, and 0.95 to 0.97 for the non-linear index DFA a1 during PRE, EX, and POST. There was no significant difference in device specific meanRR during PRE and POST. Bland–Altman analysis showed high agreement between devices (PRE and POST: meanRR bias of 0.0 and 0.4 ms, LOA of 1.9 to −1.8 ms and 2.3 to −1.5; EX: meanRR bias of 11.2 to 6.0 ms; LOA of 29.8 to −7.4 ms during low intensity exercise and 8.5 to 3.5 ms during high intensity exercise). The Movesense Medical device can be used in lieu of a reference ECG for the calculation of HRV with the potential to differentiate noise from atrial fibrillation and represents a significant advance in both a HR and HRV recording device in a chest belt form factor for lab-based or remote field-application.",2022.0,2022-03-01 00:00:00,27,74,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1673352af7b2cdde296cf8cf0057051bbd528e03

However, the methodology underlying machine learning in spine research is often overlooked as the subject matter is quite novel and may be foreign to practicing spine surgeons. Improper application of machine learning is a significant bioethics challenge, given the potential consequences of over- or underestimating the results of such studies for clinical decision-making processes. Proper peer review of these publications requires a baseline familiarity of the language associated with machine learning, and how it differs from classical statistical analyses. This narrative review first introduces the overall field of machine learning and its role in artificial intelligence, and defines basic terminology. In addition, common modalities for applying machine learning, including classification and regression decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are examined in the context of examples gathered from the spine literature.

A central question of GPCR drug discovery is to understand what determines the agonism or antagonism of ligands which bind them. Ligands exert their action via the interactions in the ligand binding pocket. We hypothesised that there is a common set of receptor interactions made by ligands of diverse structures that mediate their action and that among a large dataset of different ligands, the functionally important interactions will be over-represented. We computationally docked ~2700 known β2AR ligands to multiple β2AR structures, generating ca 75,000 docking poses and predicted all atomic interactions between the receptor and the ligand. We used machine learning (ML) techniques to identify specific interactions that correlate with the agonist or antagonist activity of these ligands. The interpretation of ML analysis in human understandable form allowed us to construct an exquisitely detailed structure-activity relationship that identifies small changes to the ligands that invert their activity and thus helps to guide the drug discovery process.

10.3390/ani12010119,ACSL4 Directs Intramuscular Adipogenesis and Fatty Acid Composition in Pigs,"Simple Summary In the livestock industry, intramuscular fat content is an important indicator of the meat quality of domestic animals. The variations of the Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene locus are associated with intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the detailed molecular function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis remains obscure. Our study reveals the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and provides new clues for improving the palatability of meat and enhancing the nutritional value of pork for human health. Abstract The intramuscular fat is a major quality trait of meat, affecting sensory attributes such as flavor and texture. Several previous GWAS studies identified Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene as the candidate gene to regulate intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the underlying molecular function of ACSL4 in adipogenesis within pig skeletal muscle is not fully investigated. In this study, we isolated porcine endogenous intramuscular adipocyte progenitors and performed ACSL4 loss- and gain-of-function experiments during adipogenic differentiation. Our data showed that ACSL4 is a positive regulator of adipogenesis in intramuscular fat cells isolated from pigs. More interestingly, the enhanced expression of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipocytes could increase the cellular content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as gamma-L eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The above results not only confirmed the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and meat quality attributes, but also provided new clues for the improvement of the nutritional value of pork for human health.",2022.0,2022-01-01 00:00:00,12,36,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74d7ebb8d6924daa6e88f5869d675bdbce09f9e5

10.3389/fgene.2021.649140,Effect of the ACAA1 Gene on Preadipocyte Differentiation in Sheep,"Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1) functions as a key regulator of fatty acid β-oxidation in peroxisomes by catalyzing the cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acyl-CoA, which participate in the extension and degradation of fatty acids. Thus, ACAA1 is an important regulator of lipid metabolism and plays an essential role in fatty acid oxidation and lipid metabolism. Our previous study findings revealed that ACAA1 is closely associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and fatty acid metabolism pathways, which are involved in fat deposition in sheep, leading to our hypothesis that ACAA1 may be involved in fat deposition by regulating lipid metabolism. However, the associated molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, to assess the potential function of ACAA1 in sheep preadipocyte differentiation, we knocked down and overexpressed ACAA1 in sheep preadipocytes and evaluated the pattern of ACAA1 gene expression during preadipocyte differentiation by qRT-PCR. ACAA1 was significantly expressed in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, and then its expression decreased. ACAA1 deficiency increased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content and promoted sheep preadipocyte differentiation, whereas ACAA1 overexpression inhibited adipogenesis and decreased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content. Simultaneously, we demonstrated that ACAA1 deficiency upregulated the expressions of the adipogenic marker genes PPARγ and C/EBPα in sheep preadipocytes, but ACAA1 overexpression inhibited the expressions of these markers, indicating that ACAA1 affects lipid metabolism by regulating adipogenic marker genes. Our results may promote a better understanding of the regulation of adipogenesis by ACAA1.",2021.0,2021-06-21 00:00:00,25,39,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0773e8d8294b1eb48cb25c5a2a87863b153ea753

We enhance our method by incorporating deep learning techniques and multi-modal imaging data, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) images alongside fundus photographs, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of retinal pathology. The advanced EDL integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms with Capsule Networks (CapsNet) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for more nuanced feature extraction and classification. We introduce a novel ensemble adaptive weighting approach that dynamically adjusts classifier weights based on performance across disease types and severity levels, significantly improving the algorithm's handling of complex and rare cases. To enhance model interpretability, we implement an explainable AI component that provides visual heatmaps of the most significant regions for each diagnosis to clinicians. We evaluate the enhanced EDL on a large, diverse dataset encompassing multiple retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma, across various ethnicities and age groups. Our results demonstrate superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to our previous model and other state-of-the-art approaches.

Previous work in cyber bullying detection is often confronted with limitations in accurately detecting abusive behavior because of the intricacies in cyber space and evolution of cyber bullying practices. A new approach of Cyber bullying detection and classification network (CBDC- Net) for improving the effectiveness of detection of cyber bullying in OSNs based on natural language processing features, feature selection techniques, and deep learning algorithms is also presented in this study. CBDC-Net can overcome these challenges to existing detection methods of cyber bullying using innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning approaches. In the data preprocessing step, CBDC-Net filter and normalize the text data that is openly collected from OSNs. After that, CBDC-Net extracts features using a Synonym Level N-Gram (SLNG) approach and it incorporates both the word and character-based information to make the synonyms of text much better than the other method. After that, CSI of CBDC-Net applied Textual Similarity Resilient Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (TSR-SCSO) for feature selection to give an iterative value of their features’ importance level to detect cyber bullying. Last, in CBDC-Net, a Recurrent Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)Neural Network for classification (RBLNN) is used as classification approach is applied, which recognizes the sequential nature of textual data enabling proper distinction between cyber bullying cases.

10.22399/ijcesen.587,HARGAN: Generative Adversarial Network BasedDeep Learning Framework for Efficient Recognition of Human Actions from Surveillance Videos,"Analyzing public surveillance videos has become an important research area as it is linked to different real-world applications. Video Analytics for human action recognition is given significance due to its utility. However, it is very challenging to analyze live-streaming videos to identify human actions across the frames in the video. The literature showed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among computer vision applications' most popular deep learning algorithms. Another important observation is that Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) architecture with deep learning has the potential to leverage effectiveness in applications using computer vision. Inspired by this finding, we created a GAN-based framework (called HARGAN) in this research for human activity identification from surveillance films. The framework exploits a retrained deep learning model known as ResNet50 and convolutional LSTM for better performance in action recognition. Our framework has two critical functionalities: feature learning and human action recognition. The ResNet50 model achieves the former, while the GAN-based convolutional LSTM model achieves the latter. We proposed an algorithm called the Generative Adversarial Approach for Human Action Recognition (GAA-HAR) to realize the framework. We used a benchmark dataset known as UCF50, which is extensively used in studies on human action identification. Based on our experimental findings, the suggested framework performs better than the current baseline models like CNN, LSTM, and convolutional LSTM, with the highest accuracy of 97.73%.

10.22399/ijcesen.597,A novel optimized deep learning based intrusion detection framework for an IoT networks,"The burgeoning importance of Internet of Things (IoT) and its diverse applications have sparked significant interest in study circles. The inherent diversity within IoT networks renders them suitable for a myriad of real-time applications, firmly embedding them into the fabric of daily life. While IoT devices streamline various activities, their susceptibility to security threats is a glaring concern. Current inadequacies in security measures render IoT networks vulnerable, presenting an enticing target for attackers. This study suggests a novel dealing to address this challenge through the execution of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) leveraging superior deep learning models. Inspired by the benefits of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), we introduce the Genetic Bee LSTM(GBLSTM) networks for the development of intelligent IDS capable of detecting a wide range of cyber-attacks targeting IoT area. The methodology comprises four key execution: (i) collection of unit for profiling normal IoT device behavior, (ii) Identification of malicious devices during an attack, (iii) Prediction of attack types implemented in the network. Intensive experimentations of the suggested IDS are conducted using various validation methods and prominent metrics across different IoT threat scenarios. Moreover, comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the suggested models alongside existing learning models. The results demonstrate that the GBLSTM-models outperform other intellectual models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, underscoring their efficacy in securing IoT networks.",2024.0,2024-11-26 00:00:00,15,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b0f781aba82d951f6b54fb04ac84f9ac504554b

10.1155/2023/1110500,Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease Using DHO-Based Pretrained CNN Model,"Detecting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) early on allows patients to take preventative measures before the onset of irreversible brain damage, which is a critical factor in the treatment of Alzheimer’s patients. Most machine detection methods are constrained by congenital observations, although computers have been utilized in several recent research studies to diagnose AD. In AD, the hippocampus is usually the first part of the brain to be affected. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (SMRI) can be used to assist in diagnosing AD by measuring the hippocampus’s form and volume (MRI). The information encoded by these attributes is restricted and may be affected by segmentation problems. These traits are also extracted independently of the classification, which could result in lower-than-desired classification accuracy. Researchers in this study used structural MRI data to develop a deep learning framework for combined automatic hippocampus segmentation and AD categorization. Multi-task deep learning (MTDL) is used to learn hippocampus segmentation simultaneously. The hyperparameter optimization of the CNN model (capsule network) for illness classification is then carried out using the deer hunting optimization (DHO) technique. ADNI-standardized MRI datasets have been used to test the suggested method, and it is accurate. Suggested MTDL achieved 97.1% accuracy and 93.5% of Dice coefficient, whereas the proposed MTDL model achieved an accuracy of 96% for binary classification and 93% for multi-class classification.",2023.0,2023-06-06 00:00:00,80,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4883251571ecd80b1ceaa21d348f32370e1ea492
10.1002/dac.5524,Energy‐efficient resource allocation model for device‐to‐device communication in 5G wireless personal area networks,"In general, there are several many devices that can overload the network and reduce performance. Devices can minimize interference and optimize bandwidth usage by using directional antennas and by avoiding overlapping communication ranges. In addition, devices need to carefully manage their use of resources, such as bandwidth and energy. Bandwidth is limited in wireless personal area networks (WPANs), so devices need to carefully select which data to send and receive. In this paper, an intelligent performance analysis of energy‐efficient resource optimization model has been proposed for device‐to‐device (D2D) communication in fifth‐generation (5G) WPAN. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation in D2D communication is important because it helps reduce energy consumption and extend the lifespan of devices that are communicating with each other. By allocating resources in an efficient manner, communication between two devices can be optimized for maximum efficiency. This helps reduce the amount of energy needed to power the communication, as well as the amount of energy needed to power the device that is communicating with another device. Additionally, efficient resource allocation helps reduce the overall cost of communication, as the use of fewer resources results in a lower overall cost. The proposed efficient resource allocation helps reduce the environmental impact of communication, as less energy is used for communication. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation model (EERAM) has reached 92.97% of energy allocation, 88.72% of power allocation, 87.79% of bandwidth allocation, 87.93% of spectrum allocation, 88.43% of channel allocation, 25.47% of end‐to‐end delay, 94.33% of network data speed, and 90.99% of network throughput.",2023.0,2023-05-22 00:00:00,64,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2157cc5cfc578902e95632858923cd254b8821ca

Therefore, countless artificial intelligence applications can be seen in the medical domain at various levels, which are employed to enhance early diagnosis and prediction and reduce the risks associated with many diseases, including heart diseases. In this article, machine learning techniques (logistic regression, random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors) are utilized to diagnose heart disease from the Cleveland Clinic dataset got from the University of California Irvine machine learning (UCL) repository and Kaggle platform then create a comparison between the performance of these techniques. In addition, some literature related to machine learning and deep learning techniques that aim to provide reasonable solutions in monitoring, detecting, diagnosing, and predicting heart disease and how these technologies assist in making health decisions are reviewed. Ten studies are selected and summarized by the authors published between 2017 and 2022 are illustrated. After executing a series of tests, it is seen that the most profitable performance in diagnosing heart disease is the support vector machines, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96%.

The need to explore possible ways to tackle the disease necessitated this study. The study designed a machine learning model for cardiovascular disease risk prediction in accordance with a dataset that contains 11 features which may be used to forecast the disease. The dataset from Kaggle on cardiovascular disease includes approximately 70,000 patient records that were used to determine the outcome. Compared to the UCI dataset, the Kaggle dataset has many more training and validation records. Models created using neural networks, random forests, Bayesian networks, C5.0, and QUEST were compared for this dataset. On training and testing data sets, the results acquired a high accuracy (99.1 percent), which is significantly superior to previous methods. Ahead-of-time detection and diagnosis of cardiac disease, as well as better treatment outcomes, are strong possibilities for the suggested prediction model. Additionally, it may help patients better manage their illness or life forms in order to increase their chances of recovery/survival. The result showed greater accuracy and promising signs that machine-learning algorithms can indeed assist in early identification of the disease and improvement of the treatment outcome.",2023.0,2023-03-01 00:00:00,34,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84d45bc53271835cb401dc1fee5c136b3c4f8827
10.3390/min12010049,Objective Domain Boundaries Detection in New Caledonian Nickel Laterite from Spectra Using Quadrant Scan,"Modelling of 3D domain boundaries using information from drill holes is a standard procedure in mineral exploration and mining. Manual logging of drill holes can be difficult to exploit as the results may not be comparable between holes due to the subjective nature of geological logging. Exploration and mining companies commonly collect geochemical or mineralogical data from diamond drill core or drill chips; however, manual interpretation of multivariate data can be slow and challenging; therefore, automation of any of the steps in the interpretation process would be valuable. Hyperspectral analysis of drill chips provides a relatively inexpensive method of collecting very detailed information rapidly and consistently. However, the challenge of such data is the high dimensionality of the data’s variables in comparison to the number of samples. Hyperspectral data is usually processed to produce mineral abundances generally involving a range of assumptions. This paper presents the results of testing a new fast and objective methodology to identify the lithological boundaries from high dimensional hyperspectral data. This method applies a quadrant scan analysis to recurrence plots. The results, applied to nickel laterite deposits from New Caledonia, demonstrate that this method can identify transitions in the downhole data. These are interpreted as reflecting mineralogical changes that can be used as an aid in geological logging to improve boundary detection.",2021.0,2021-12-29 00:00:00,4,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3dec49892bb2c0b276db58768c0532e2dbc78301

10.1080/08120099.2021.1971763,"Improving geological logging of drill holes using geochemical data and data analytics for mineral exploration in the Gawler Ranges, South Australia","Abstract Geochemical data are frequently collected from mineral exploration drill-hole samples to more accurately define and characterise the geological units intersected by the drill hole. However, large multi-element data sets are slow and challenging to interpret without using some form of automated analysis, such as mathematical, statistical or machine learning techniques. Automated analysis techniques also have the advantage in that they are repeatable and can provide consistent results, even for very large data sets. In this paper, an automated litho-geochemical interpretation workflow is demonstrated, which includes data exploration and data preparation using appropriate compositional data-analysis techniques. Multiscale analysis using a modified wavelet tessellation has been applied to the data to provide coherent geological domains. Unsupervised machine learning (clustering) has been used to provide a first-pass classification. The results are compared with the detailed geologist’s logs. The comparison shows how the integration of automated analysis of geochemical data can be used to enhance traditional geological logging and demonstrates the identification of new geological units from the automated litho-geochemical logging that were not apparent from visual logging but are geochemically distinct. KEY POINTS To reduce computational complexity and facilitate interpretation, a subset of geochemical elements is selected, and then a centred log-ratio transform is applied. The wavelet tessellation method is used to domain the drill holes into rock units at a range of scales. Several clustering methods were tested to identify distinct rock units in the samples and multiscale domains for classification. Results are compared with geologist’s logs to assess how geochemical data analysis can inform and improve traditional geology logs.",2021.0,2021-09-27 00:00:00,10,85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77e8be0bb4725babb4c79ef27089595fcb923a2b

10.1109/TII.2020.3030620,Intersecting Machining Feature Localization and Recognition via Single Shot Multibox Detector,"In Industrie 4.0, machines are expected to become autonomous, self-aware and self-correcting. One important step in the area of manufacturing is feature recognition that aims to detect all the machining features from a 3-D model. In this research area, recognizing and locating a wide variety of highly intersecting features are extremely challenging as the topology information of features is substantially damaged because of the feature intersection. Motivated by the single shot multibox detector (SSD), this article presents a novel deep learning approach named SsdNet to tackle the machining feature localization and recognition problem. The typical SSD is designed for 2-D image objection detection rather than 3-D feature recognition. Therefore, the network architecture and output of SSD are modified to fulfil the purpose of this research. In addition, some advanced techniques are also utilized to further enhance the recognition performance. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art feature recognition performance (95.20% F-score), localization performance (90.62% F-score), and recognition efficiency (243.85 ms per model).",2021.0,2021-05-01 00:00:00,26,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c7489d368bc958a031871b47d3c232273511486

This region experiences groundwater ecosystem degradation as a result of the rapid conversion of rural agricultural land to urban areas under chronic drought conditions. This study aims to enhance Groundwater Pollution Risk (GwPR) mapping by integrating the DRASTIC index with machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), alongside hydrogeochemical investigations, to promote sustainable water management in Kerman Province.

10.1613/JAIR.1.11675,Automatic Language Identification in Texts: A Survey,"
 
 
Language identification (“LI”) is the problem of determining the natural language that a document or part thereof is written in. Automatic LI has been extensively researched for over fifty years. Today, LI is a key part of many text processing pipelines, as text processing techniques generally assume that the language of the input text is known. Research in this area has recently been especially active. This article provides a brief history of LI research, and an extensive survey of the features and methods used in the LI literature. We describe the features and methods using a unified notation, to make the relationships between methods clearer. We discuss evaluation methods, applications of LI, as well as off-the-shelfLI systems that do not require training by the end user. Finally, we identify open issues, survey the work to date on each issue, and propose future directions for research in LI.

The objective is to find the context of the dog barking pattern based on various real-time scenarios, including whether the dogs are alone, looking at strangers, or showing an eagerness to fight. The barks of the dogs were recorded inside the house under different scenarios, such as while identifying the owner or strangers. Machine learning algorithms, such as the reinforcement learning method, were used in predicting and classifying the dog sounds. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning that will generate the next best action for the given state. It is a model-free learning used to find the best course of dog action for the given current state of the dog. The Q-learning algorithm had been used in improving the prediction of dog sounds by updating the values of learning, where the values with the highest reward were taken into consideration. In total, 6171 barks were collected from the dogs chosen for study, and the proposed approach achieved a correct prediction accuracy of 85.19% of the dog sounds.",2022.0,2022-10-21 00:00:00,2,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/746805238ec86d890b1c01156f58bb23ae4331fc
10.3390/s22030993,Deep Learning Empowered Wearable-Based Behavior Recognition for Search and Rescue Dogs,"Search and Rescue (SaR) dogs are important assets in the hands of first responders, as they have the ability to locate the victim even in cases where the vision and or the sound is limited, due to their inherent talents in olfactory and auditory senses. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-assisted implementation incorporating a wearable device, a base station, a mobile application, and a cloud-based infrastructure that can first monitor in real-time the activity, the audio signals, and the location of a SaR dog, and second, recognize and alert the rescuing team whenever the SaR dog spots a victim. For this purpose, we employed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) both for the activity recognition and the sound classification, which are trained using data from inertial sensors, such as 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope and from the wearable’s microphone, respectively. The developed deep learning models were deployed on the wearable device, while the overall proposed implementation was validated in two discrete search and rescue scenarios, managing to successfully spot the victim (i.e., obtained F1-score more than 99%) and inform the rescue team in real-time for both scenarios.",2022.0,2022-01-27 00:00:00,25,52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/773f1fcbaa6b5752c098766e3423e5ebfc7e4d50

10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2457417,The Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (GeMAPS) for Voice Research and Affective Computing,"Work on voice sciences over recent decades has led to a proliferation of acoustic parameters that are used quite selectively and are not always extracted in a similar fashion. With many independent teams working in different research areas, shared standards become an essential safeguard to ensure compliance with state-of-the-art methods allowing appropriate comparison of results across studies and potential integration and combination of extraction and recognition systems. In this paper we propose a basic standard acoustic parameter set for various areas of automatic voice analysis, such as paralinguistic or clinical speech analysis. In contrast to a large brute-force parameter set, we present a minimalistic set of voice parameters here. These were selected based on a) their potential to index affective physiological changes in voice production, b) their proven value in former studies as well as their automatic extractability, and c) their theoretical significance. The set is intended to provide a common baseline for evaluation of future research and eliminate differences caused by varying parameter sets or even different implementations of the same parameters. Our implementation is publicly available with the openSMILE toolkit. Comparative evaluations of the proposed feature set and large baseline feature sets of INTERSPEECH challenges show a high performance of the proposed set in relation to its size.",2016.0,2016-04-01 00:00:00,1428,73,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10f992779c2601af8a33f53c813cb6342791873f

10.3390/molecules27206795,Preprocessing NIR Spectra for Aquaphotomics,"Even though NIR spectroscopy is based on the Beer–Lambert law, which clearly relates the concentration of the absorbing elements with the absorbance, the measured spectra are subject to spurious signals, such as additive and multiplicative effects. The use of NIR spectra, therefore, requires a preprocessing step. This article reviews the main preprocessing methods in the light of aquaphotomics. Simple methods for visualizing the spectra are proposed in order to guide the user in the choice of the best preprocessing. The most common chemometrics preprocessing are presented and illustrated by three real datasets. Some preprocessing aims to produce a spectrum as close as possible to the absorbance that would have been measured under ideal conditions and is very useful for the establishment of an aquagram. Others, dedicated to the improvement of the resolution of the spectra, are very useful for the identification of the peaks. Finally, special attention is given to the problem of reducing multiplicative effects and to the potential pitfalls of some very popular methods in chemometrics.

10.3322/caac.21763,"Cancer statistics, 2023","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus‐associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.",2023.0,2023-01-01 00:00:00,9888,124,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb004c1bd6796118879563b226def1973c41531c
10.1364/boe.447687,Fluorescence lifetime needle optical biopsy discriminates hepatocellular carcinoma.,"This work presents results of in vivo and in situ measurements of hepatocellular carcinoma by a developed optical biopsy system. Here, we describe the technical details of the implementation of fluorescence lifetime and diffuse reflectance measurements by the system, equipped with an original needle optical probe, compatible with the 17.5G biopsy needle standard. The fluorescence lifetime measurements observed by the setup were verified in fresh solutions of NADH and FAD++, and then applied in a murine model for the characterisation of inoculated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent liver tissue. The technique, applied in vivo and in situ and supplemented by measurements of blood oxygen saturation, made it possible to reveal statistically significant transformation in the set of measured parameters linked with the cellular pools of NADH and NADPH. In the animal model, we demonstrate that the characteristic changes in registered fluorescent parameters can be used to reliably distinguish the HCC tissue, liver tissue in the control, and the metabolically changed liver tissues of animals with the developed HCC tumour. For further transition to clinical applications, the optical biopsy system was tested during the routing procedure of the PNB in humans with suspected HCC. The comparison of the data from murine and human HCC tissues suggests that the tested animal model is generally representative in the sense of the registered fluorescence lifetime parameters, while statistically significant differences between their absolute values can still be observed.",2021.0,2021-12-03 00:00:00,15,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4629215735d7fe0ebb6be80ff13a86ff5c9c6704

10.1002/asi.24493,Lexical data augmentation for sentiment analysis,"Machine learning methods, especially deep learning models, have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks including sentiment analysis. However, deep learning models are more demanding for training data. Data augmentation techniques are widely used to generate new instances based on modifications to existing data or relying on external knowledge bases to address annotated data scarcity, which hinders the full potential of machine learning techniques. This paper presents our work using part‐of‐speech (POS) focused lexical substitution for data augmentation (PLSDA) to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms in sentiment analysis. We exploit POS information to identify words to be replaced and investigate different augmentation strategies to find semantically related substitutions when generating new instances. The choice of POS tags as well as a variety of strategies such as semantic‐based substitution methods and sampling methods are discussed in detail. Performance evaluation focuses on the comparison between PLSDA and two previous lexical substitution‐based data augmentation methods, one of which is thesaurus‐based, and the other is lexicon manipulation based. Our approach is tested on five English sentiment analysis benchmarks: SST‐2, MR, IMDB, Twitter, and AirRecord. Hyperparameters such as the candidate similarity threshold and number of newly generated instances are optimized. Results show that six classifiers (SVM, LSTM, BiLSTM‐AT, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers [BERT], XLNet, and RoBERTa) trained with PLSDA achieve accuracy improvement of more than 0.6% comparing to two previous lexical substitution methods averaged on five benchmarks. Introducing POS constraint and well‐designed augmentation strategies can improve the reliability of lexical data augmentation methods. Consequently, PLSDA significantly improves the performance of sentiment analysis algorithms.",2021.0,2021-06-17 00:00:00,29,49,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff15e5a042c5a987b20c13377894762e70f48175

In NLP similar results are reported most commonly for low data regimes, non-pretrained models, or situationally for pretrained models. In this paper we ask how effective these techniques really are when applied to pretrained transformers. Using two popular varieties of task-agnostic data augmentation (not tailored to any particular task), Easy Data Augmentation (Wei andZou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrichet al., 2015), we conduct a systematic examination of their effects across 5 classification tasks, 6 datasets, and 3 variants of modern pretrained transformers, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. We observe a negative result, finding that techniques which previously reported strong improvements for non-pretrained models fail to consistently improve performance for pretrained transformers, even when training data is limited. We hope this empirical analysis helps inform practitioners where data augmentation techniques may confer improvements.",2020.0,2020-10-05 00:00:00,80,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f10f898e42973e7c3dee36ccb24d96e39e4583cc

10.3389/frai.2021.622616,A Machine Learning Approach to Monitor the Emergence of Late Intrauterine Growth Restriction,"Late intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a fetal pathological condition characterized by chronic hypoxia secondary to placental insufficiency, resulting in an abnormal rate of fetal growth. This pathology has been associated with increased fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In standard clinical practice, late IUGR diagnosis can only be suspected in the third trimester and ultimately confirmed at birth. This study presents a radial basis function support vector machine (RBF-SVM) classification based on quantitative features extracted from fetal heart rate (FHR) signals acquired using routine cardiotocography (CTG) in a population of 160 healthy and 102 late IUGR fetuses. First, the individual performance of each time, frequency, and nonlinear feature was tested. To improve the unsatisfactory results of univariate analysis we firstly adopted a Recursive Feature Elimination approach to select the best subset of FHR-based parameters contributing to the discrimination of healthy vs. late IUGR fetuses. A fine tuning of the RBF-SVM model parameters resulted in a satisfactory classification performance in the training set (accuracy 0.93, sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.84). Comparable results were obtained when applying the model on a totally independent testing set. This investigation supports the use of a multivariate approach for the in utero identification of late IUGR condition based on quantitative FHR features encompassing different domains. The proposed model allows describing the relationships among features beyond the traditional linear approaches, thus improving the classification performance. This framework has the potential to be proposed as a screening tool for the identification of late IUGR fetuses.",2021.0,2021-03-08 00:00:00,20,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/477cc5801615317ab1fe5e4ca392ae78ccd68ff7

The L2-norm and dynamic time warping are proposed as suitable similarity measures for calculating the distance matrices, and these are clustered using the unsupervised density-based DBSCAN algorithm. The silhouette coefficient and the number of trajectories classified as noise are used as quality measures for the clustering. The ability of clustering to provide rapid overview of large and complex trajectory data sets, and its utility for extracting chemical and physical insight, is demonstrated on trajectories corresponding to the photochemical ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, noting that the clustering can be used to generate reduced dimensionality representations in an unbiased manner.",2023.0,2023-09-13 00:00:00,3,89,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7a530b46ec66cdda061e86bd7668cf400d4ed36

10.3389/fmolb.2020.00106,On Calculating Free Energy Differences Using Ensembles of Transition Paths,"The free energy of a process is the fundamental quantity that determines its spontaneity or propensity at a given temperature. In particular, the binding free energy of a drug candidate to its biomolecular target is used as an objective quantity in drug design. Recently, binding kinetics—rates of association (kon) and dissociation (koff)—have also demonstrated utility for their ability to predict efficacy and in some cases have been shown to be more predictive than the binding free energy alone. Some methods exist to calculate binding kinetics from molecular simulations, although these are typically more difficult to calculate than the binding affinity as they depend on details of the transition path ensemble. Assessing these rate constants can be difficult, due to uncertainty in the definition of the bound and unbound states, large error bars and the lack of experimental data. As an additional consistency check, rate constants from simulation can be used to calculate free energies (using the log of their ratio) which can then be compared to free energies obtained experimentally or using alchemical free energy perturbation. However, in this calculation it is not straightforward to account for common, practical details such as the finite simulation volume or the particular definition of the “bound” and “unbound” states. Here we derive a set of correction terms that can be applied to calculations of binding free energies using full reactive trajectories. We apply these correction terms to revisit the calculation of binding free energies from rate constants for a host-guest system that was part of a blind prediction challenge, where significant deviations were observed between free energies calculated with rate ratios and those calculated from alchemical perturbation. The correction terms combine to significantly decrease the error with respect to computational benchmarks, from 3.4 to 0.76 kcal/mol. Although these terms were derived with weighted ensemble simulations in mind, some of the correction terms are generally applicable to free energies calculated using physical pathways via methods such as Markov state modeling, metadynamics, milestoning, or umbrella sampling.",2020.0,2020-06-05 00:00:00,33,73,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1897d451b669ea9e69484a31a44aa2175cb33449

Thus, the modelling, characterization, classification, diagnosis, and analysis of such mental disorders bears great significance in medical research. Electroencephalogram records provide important information to improve clinical diagnosis and are very useful in the scientific community. In this work, electroencephalogram records and patient data from the Hospital Virgen de la Luz in Cuenca (Spain) were processed for a correct classification of bipolar disorders. This work implemented an innovative radial basis function-based neural network employing a fuzzy means algorithm. The results show that the proposed method is an effective approach for discrimination of two kinds of classes, i.e., bipolar disorder patients and healthy persons. The proposed algorithm achieved the best performance compared with other machine learning techniques such as Bayesian linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian naive Bayes, decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, or support vector machine, showing a very high accuracy close to 97%.

Currently, several approaches classified as electrical, magnetic, neuroimaging recordings and brain stimulations are available to obtain neural activity of the human brain. Among them, non-invasive methods like electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly employed, as they can provide a high degree of temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds) and acceptable space resolution. In addition, it is simple, quick, and does not create any physical harm or stress to patients. Concerning signal processing, once the neural signals are acquired, different procedures can be applied for feature extraction. In particular, brain signals are normally processed in time, frequency, and/or space domains. The features extracted are then used for signal classification depending on its characteristics such us the mean, variance or band power. The role of machine learning in this regard has become of key importance during the last years due to its high capacity to analyze complex amounts of data. The algorithms employed are generally classified in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement techniques. A deep review of the most used machine learning algorithms and the advantages/drawbacks of most used methods is presented. Finally, a study of these procedures utilized in a very specific and novel research field of electroencephalography, i.e., autobiographical memory deficits in schizophrenia, is outlined.",2021.0,2021-12-05 00:00:00,32,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2451d54965cbe89b302d545ec3f07cd2e905c835

This paper describes the development of a model for the turbulence spectrum measured by a short-range, continuous-wave lidar. The lidar performance was assessed by measurements conducted with two WindScanners in an open jet wind tunnel equipped with an active grid, for a range of different turbulent wind conditions. A one-dimensional hot wire anemometer was used as a reference for characterising the lidar turbulence measurement. In addition to addressing the statistics, the correlation between the time series and the mean error on the wind speed, the lidar measurement turbulence spectrum is compared with a theoretical spectrum using Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A theoretical model for the probe length averaging effect is applied in the frequency domain, using a Lorentzian filter in combination with generated white noise, and evaluated by qualitatively matching the lidar measurement spectrum. High goodness of fit coefficients and low mean absolute errors between hot wire and WindScanner were observed for the measured time series. The correlation showed an inverse relationship with the prevalent turbulence intensity in the flow for cases with a comparable power spectrum shape. Larger flow structures can be captured more accurately by the lidar, whereas small-scale turbulent flow structures are partly filtered out as a result of the lidars' probe volume averaging. It is demonstrated that an accurate way to define the frequency at which the lidar power spectrum starts to deviate from the hot wire reference spectrum is the point at which the coherence drops below 0.5. This coherence-based cut-off frequency increases linearly with the mean wind speed and is generally an order of magnitude lower than the probe length cut-off frequency, estimated according to a simple model based on Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A convincing match between the modelled and the actual WindScanner power spectrum was found for various different cases, which confirmed that the deviation of the lidar measurement power spectrum in the higher frequency range can be analytically explained and modelled as a combination of a Lorentzian probe length averaging effect and white noise in the lidar measurement.

The technique is applied after quality assurance/quality control (QAQC) processing to quantify residual error, both bias and random, from solid-body interference, shot noise, and any additional uncertainty introduced to the data from the QAQC process itself. The approach follows from the one-time construction of a high-dimensional parametric database of synthetic lidar spectra and subsequent processing with an existing QAQC technique. A model of the correspondence between the spectral shape and the associated residual errors due to non-ideal features is then developed for quantities of interest (QOIs) including the geometric median and spectral standard deviation of line-of-sight velocity. The model is preliminarily implemented within a neural network framework that is then applied in post-processing to sample returns from a DTU SpinnerLidar. The initial analysis uncovers the effects of specific sources of uncertainty in the context of both individual spectra and full-field maps of the measurement domain. The technique is described in terms of application to continuous wave (CW) lidar, though it is also relevant to pulsed lidar.",2020.0,2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/135f6152c270df1ade7211458aaf2a7fee594066

Interest is particularly directed at the structures and spectra which are influential for wake recovery and downstream turbine loading. This initial work is to determine the feasibility of using nacelle-mounted, continuous-wave lidars to measure and validate wake physics via comparisons of full actuator line simulation results with those obtained from a virtual lidar embedded within the computational domain. Analyses are conducted on the dominant large-scale flow structures via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and on the various scales of wake-added turbulence through spectral comparisons. The virtual lidar adequately reproduces spatial structures and energies compared to the full simulation results. Correction of the higher-frequency turbulence spectra for volume-averaging attenuation was most successful at locations where mean gradients were not severe.

Due to the complexity, variability, and asymmetry of information, the construction of traditional information dissemination index systems demands excessive reliance on manual intervention, has large deviations, and is applied in a limited range. Such shortcomings cannot meet the requirements of constructing an objective, comprehensive, and highly credible index system. Therefore, we propose a method of constructing a multilevel and multigranular information dissemination index system with complex perspectives. In addition, we use the deep learning method of the convolutional neural network to extract the rich convolution features of public opinion events in the information dissemination process.

The consumer culture of livestream e-commerce is becoming popular in China. However, a report from Southern Finance Omnimedia Corp of China pointed out that among China's top 1,000 livestream sellers, the top 20 sellers have contributed to nearly half of the gross merchandise volume (GMV), using three major Chinese streaming platforms: Taobao, Douyin, and Kuaishou. Moreover, a novice in livestream e-commerce knows less about the important impact factors of the realm. Akin to the adage, “well aware is well prepared,” knowing more about the influencing factors of livestream e-commerce more will be the chances to promote the commercial value. A benchmark research is needed to systematically trace out the most important and influencing factors and to make possible the rising of selling with less effort, hence this study. The research intends to sort out the relevant influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce by reviewing previous related literature. Then, through the Delphi method, eight experts constructed the 14 main influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce. Through DEMATEL-ANP, we can not only find the key factors but also sort out the causal relationship between the main key factors, forming a preliminary evaluation model of the commercial value of livestream sellers. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) of these impact factors found that “seller popularity” is the most critical factor affecting consumers’ shopping motivation. At the same time, product discounts, product quality, and the attractiveness of the sellers are being included in effects by the “seller popularity.” The investigation followed in this study revealed that characteristics of the livestream seller are one of the most influencing factor achieving a total weight of 0.3020, whereas the streaming platform is the least influencing factor (total weight is 0.1333). The assessment made the study explore the sustainability of livestream e-commerce in China, and the proposed evaluation model can be used for the preliminary business value evaluation of people engaged in livestream sellers and related industries.",2022.0,2022-02-21 00:00:00,14,87,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9710f7a0bf137cf2610bc6b1ebcf5319b1cb711e

10.3934/mbe.2021341,Research on public opinion guidance of converging media based on AHP and transmission dynamics.,"In the 5G era, media convergence and technological updates lead to tremendous changes in the dissemination of public opinion information. The guidance of public opinion in the converged media environment is a new research topic. Users participate in the discussion of different media, and flow in and out from different media, which gradually generate a new complex dynamics model of the dissemination of public opinion information. An index system for evaluating the influence of converged media communication that combines the advantages of traditional media and new media is constructed. We use AHP to determine the index weights in the evaluation system and conduct consistency tests. The final weight of each media is determined through the combination of subjective and objective methods, which provides data supports for later determining the participation of various media in the dissemination process of public opinion information. Based on the SIR model, a UCIR (unknown-contact-infected-recovered) dynamic model is established. The simulation results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the UCIR model is 31.6% lower than that of the SIR model. Finally, by fixing the key parameters α, β, θ, ε, p, q in the UCIR model, and changing only one of them, we studied the effect of the transition probability between different states on the process of public opinion information transmission, and then proposed corresponding guidance. In addition, from the two perspectives of network media and government, the countermeasures and suggestions for the guidance of public opinion are proposed. We try to solve the problems of humanities and social sciences with the method of natural science. These research results can provide theoretical and methodological support for people to understand the law of public opinion information transmission and establish a guiding mechanism for public opinion information transmission.",2021.0,2021-08-17 00:00:00,5,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d79df326fbf63e24a42abc5c8defe4fbb718dbf

Reflectance indices obtained by an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Spec 4 hyperspectral spectrometer from tomato growth in two soil texture types exposed to four water stress levels (70–100% FC, 60–70% FC, 50–60% FC, and 40–50% FC) was deployed to schedule irrigation and management of crops’ water stress. The treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in a 2 × 4 factorial experiment. Water stress treatments were monitored with Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) every 12 h before and after irrigation to maintain soil water content at the desired (FC%). Soil electrical conductivity (Ec) was measured daily throughout the growth cycle of tomatoes in both soil types. Ec was revealing a strong correlation with water stress at R2 above 0.95 p < 0.001. Yield was measured at the end of the end of the growing season. The results revealed that yield had a high correlation with water stress at R2 = 0.9758 and 0.9816 p < 0.01 for sandy loam and silty loam soils, respectively. Leaf temperature (LT °C), relative leaf water content (RLWC), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), Leaf area index (LAI), were measured at each growth stage at the same time spectral reflectance data were measured throughout the growth period. Spectral reflectance indices used were grouped into three: (1) greenness vegetative indices; (2) water overtone vegetation indices; (3) Photochemical Reflectance Index centered at 570 nm (PRI570), and normalized PRI (PRInorm). These reflectance indices were strongly correlated with all four water stress indicators and yield. The results revealed that NDVI, RDVI, WI, NDWI, NDWI1640, PRI570, and PRInorm were the most sensitive indices for estimating crop water stress at each growth stage in both sandy loam and silty loam soils at R2 above 0.35. This study recounts the depth of 858 to 1640 nm band absorption to water stress estimation, comparing it to other band depths to give an insight into the usefulness of ground-based hyperspectral reflectance indices for assessing crop water stress at different growth stages in different soil types.",2021.0,2021-08-24 00:00:00,28,76,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cde042d39f32988e07278c5afd647b364fa01ee

10.3390/rs13010147,Applying RGB- and Thermal-Based Vegetation Indices from UAVs for High-Throughput Field Phenotyping of Drought Tolerance in Forage Grasses,"The persistence and productivity of forage grasses, important sources for feed production, are threatened by climate change-induced drought. Breeding programs are in search of new drought tolerant forage grass varieties, but those programs still rely on time-consuming and less consistent visual scoring by breeders. In this study, we evaluate whether Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing can complement or replace this visual breeder score. A field experiment was set up to test the drought tolerance of genotypes from three common forage types of two different species: Festuca arundinacea, diploid Lolium perenne and tetraploid Lolium perenne. Drought stress was imposed by using mobile rainout shelters. UAV flights with RGB and thermal sensors were conducted at five time points during the experiment. Visual-based indices from different colour spaces were selected that were closely correlated to the breeder score. Furthermore, several indices, in particular H and NDLab, from the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and CIELab (Commission Internationale de l’éclairage) colour space, respectively, displayed a broad-sense heritability that was as high or higher than the visual breeder score, making these indices highly suited for high-throughput field phenotyping applications that can complement or even replace the breeder score. The thermal-based Crop Water Stress Index CWSI provided complementary information to visual-based indices, enabling the analysis of differences in ecophysiological mechanisms for coping with reduced water availability between species and ploidy levels. All species/types displayed variation in drought stress tolerance, which confirms that there is sufficient variation for selection within these groups of grasses. Our results confirmed the better drought tolerance potential of Festuca arundinacea, but also showed which Lolium perenne genotypes are more tolerant.",2021.0,2021-01-05 00:00:00,44,102,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c3785e2ac666d01a8cc3ddb9900f2ec11e1936c

Utilizing the rule of deep learning (DL), we introduce and fine-tune two robust frameworks, ResNet 50 and Inception V3, specifically designed for the classification of brain MRI images. Building upon the previous success of ResNet 50 and Inception V3 in classifying other medical imaging datasets, our investigation encompasses datasets with distinct characteristics, including one with four classes and another with two. The primary contribution of our research lies in the meticulous curation of these paired datasets. We have also integrated essential techniques, including Early Stopping and ReduceLROnPlateau, to refine the model through hyperparameter optimization. This involved adding extra layers, experimenting with various loss functions and learning rates, and incorporating dropout layers and regularization to ensure model convergence in predictions. Furthermore, strategic enhancements, such as customized pooling and regularization layers, have significantly elevated the accuracy of our models, resulting in remarkable classification accuracy. Notably, the pairing of ResNet 50 with the Nadam optimizer yields extraordinary accuracy rates, reaching 99.34% for gliomas, 93.52% for meningiomas, 98.68% for non-tumorous images, and 97.70% for pituitary tumors. These results underscore the transformative potential of our custom-made approach, achieving an aggregate testing accuracy of 97.68% for these four distinct classes. In a two-class dataset, Resnet 50 with the Adam optimizer excels, demonstrating better precision, recall, F1 score, and an overall accuracy of 99.84%. Moreover, it attains perfect per-class accuracy of 99.62% for ‘Tumor Positive’ and 100% for ‘Tumor Negative’, underscoring a remarkable advancement in the realm of brain tumor categorization.

Big data is a crucial aspect of modern computing, and the choice of processing framework can significantly impact performance and efficiency. The technical revolution of big data has changed how organizations handle and value large databases. As data quantities expand quickly, effective and scalable data processing systems are essential. MapReduce and Apache Spark are two of the most popular large data processing techniques. This study compares these two frameworks to determine their merits, shortcomings, and applicability for big data applications. Nearly quintillion bytes of data are created daily. Approximately 90% of data was produced in the previous two years. At this stage, data comes from temperature sensors, social media, movies, photographs, transaction records (like banking records), mobile phone conversations, GPS signals, etc. In this article, all key big data technologies are introduced. This document compares all big data technologies and discusses their merits and downsides. Run trials using multiple data sets of varying sizes to validate and explain the study. Graphical depiction shows how one tool outperforms others for given data. Big Data is data generated by the rapid usage of the internet, sensors, and heavy machinery, with great volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Numbers, photos, videos, and text are omnipresent in every sector. Due to the pace and amount of data generation, the computing system struggles to manage large data. Data is stored in a distributed architectural file system due to its size and complexity. Big distributed file systems, which must be fault-tolerant, adaptable, and scalable, make complicated data analysis dangerous and time-consuming. Big data collection is called ‘datafication’. Big data is ‘datafied’ for productivity.

Based on a large cohort of newly diagnosed CLL/SLL patients from China, we investigated immunophenotypes, genetic abnormalities, and their correlations. Eighty-four percent of the CLL/SLL patients showed typical immunophenotypes with scores of 4 or 5 points in the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) scoring system (classic group), and the remaining 16% of patients were atypical with scores lower than 4 points (atypical group). Trisomy 12 and variants of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, ATM, and MYD88 were the most recurrent genetic aberrations. Additionally, unsupervised genomic analysis based on molecular genetics revealed distinctive characteristics of MYD88 variants in CLL/SLL. By overlapping different correlation grouping analysis from genetics to immunophenotypes, the results showed MYD88 variants to be highly related to atypical CLL/SLL immunophenotypes. Furthermore, compared with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the genetic landscape showed potential value in clinical differential diagnosis of atypical CLL/SLL and MCL patients.

10.3390/cancers13061340,Detection of Rare Germline Variants in the Genomes of Patients with B-Cell Neoplasms,"Simple Summary The global importance of rare variants in tumorigenesis has been addressed by some pan-cancer analysis, revealing significant enrichments in protein-truncating variants affecting genes such as ATM, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, and MSH6. Germline variants can influence treatment response and contribute to the development of treatment-related second neoplasms, especially in childhood leukemia. We aimed to analyze the genomes of patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders for the discovery of genes enriched in rare pathogenic variants. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in germline rare and dysfunctional variants. Additionally, we detected rare and likely pathogenic variants associated with disease prognosis and potential druggability, indicating a relevant role of these events in the variability of cancer phenotypes. Abstract There is growing evidence indicating the implication of germline variation in cancer predisposition and prognostication. Here, we describe an analysis of likely disruptive rare variants across the genomes of 726 patients with B-cell lymphoid neoplasms. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in rare dysfunctional variants, both of which participate in the regulation of oxidative stress pathways (CHMP6 and GSTA4). Additionally, we detected 1675 likely disrupting variants in genes associated with cancer, of which 44.75% were novel events and 7.88% were protein-truncating variants. Among these, the most frequently affected genes were ATM, BIRC6, CLTCL1A, and TSC2. Homozygous or germline double-hit variants were detected in 28 cases, and coexisting somatic events were observed in 17 patients, some of which affected key lymphoma drivers such as ATM, KMT2D, and MYC. Finally, we observed that variants in six different genes were independently associated with shorter survival in CLL. Our study results support an important role for rare germline variation in the pathogenesis and prognosis of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms.",2021.0,2021-03-01 00:00:00,13,88,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5596d9bec3324f591f529dd8037417c823fcb892

10.2196/17125,A Deep Artificial Neural Network−Based Model for Prediction of Underlying Cause of Death From Death Certificates: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Background Coding of underlying causes of death from death certificates is a process that is nowadays undertaken mostly by humans with potential assistance from expert systems, such as the Iris software. It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the CépiDc (Centre d’épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de Décès) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner. Objective This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death. Methods The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject’s age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject’s underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network−based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach’s superiority was assessed via bootstrap. Results The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010. Conclusions This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.",2020.0,2020-04-01 00:00:00,18,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07a5a4418c0b84a88c2a03487affcccc4bf245e7

10.1002/cpe.7285,Efficient exact algorithms for continuous bi‐objective performance‐energy optimization of applications with linear energy and monotonically increasing performance profiles on heterogeneous high performance computing platforms,"Performance and energy are the two most important objectives for optimization on heterogeneous high performance computing platforms. This work studies a mathematical problem motivated by the bi‐objective optimization of data‐parallel applications on such platforms for performance and energy. First, we formulate the problem and present an exact algorithm of polynomial complexity solving the problem where all the application profiles of objective type one are continuous and strictly increasing, and all the application profiles of objective type two are linear increasing. We then apply the algorithm to develop solutions for two related optimization problems of parallel applications on heterogeneous hybrid platforms, one for performance and dynamic energy and the other for performance and total energy. Our proposed solution methods are then employed to solve the two bi‐objective optimization problems for two data‐parallel applications, matrix multiplication and gene sequencing, on a hybrid platform employing five heterogeneous processors, namely, two different Intel multicore CPUs, an Nvidia K40c GPU, an Nvidia P100 PCIe GPU, and an Intel Xeon Phi.",2022.0,2022-09-02 00:00:00,4,39,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2522a6ded924ff150e5aa90c340c5622f724ecd3

The main objectives of this study were to use a feature engineering approach to incorporate clinical expert knowledge prior to applying machine learning techniques, and to assess the impact of the approach on model complexity and performance. Four machine learning models were trained to predict mortality with a severe asthma case study. Experiments to select fewer input features based on a discriminative score showed low to moderate precision for discovering clinically meaningful triplets, indicating that discriminative score alone cannot replace clinical input. When compared to baseline machine learning models, we found a decrease in model complexity with use of fewer features informed by discriminative score and filtering of laboratory features with clinical input. We also found a small difference in performance for the mortality prediction task when comparing baseline ML models to models that used filtered features. Encoding demographic and triplet information in ML models with filtered features appeared to show performance improvements from the baseline. These findings indicated that the use of filtered features may reduce model complexity, and with little impact on performance.",2020.0,2020-04-23 00:00:00,28,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8d163033b58317b58a3fd2389e1ac2209be1f40

10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul1500,Research on the Impact of Geopolitical Instability on Russian Trade,"This study examines how global and country- specific geopolitical instability affects Russian trade using data from 1996 to 2021. A panel regression model analyzes trade between Russia and its 15 top trading partners, exploring both direct and indirect effects. The analysis focuses on how accumulated foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange rate fluctuations mediate these relationships. The findings reveal that global geopolitical instability decrease Russian trade by 0.0558. Interestingly, this negative impact is partially mediated by a decrease in FDI (-0.0805). This aligns with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, which show a significant negative effect of global geopolitical instability on FDI (-1.209). This suggests that FDI acts as a key transmitter of the negative effects of global instability on Russian trade. The role of exchange rate fluctuations, however, is more complex. While the Sobel Test indicated a negative indirect effect, the SEM analysis shows a positive indirect effect through exchange rate fluctuations on trade. This suggests potentially countervailing effects of currency fluctuations, with depreciation potentially incentivizing exports while appreciation might make imports cheaper. The impact of country-specific geopolitical instability varies depending on the context. Industries like food products and textiles are significantly affected by geopolitical instability increase, while sectors such as fuels, metals and raw materials show resilience. Close trading partners are less affected by global instability but suffer from partner- specific instability. Geographically, Western Europe benefits from global instability but faces challenges from partner-specific instability, contrasting with Eastern Europe and Asia. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how geopolitical instability, mediated by FDI and exchange rates, shapes Russia's trade performance.",2024.0,2024-08-03 00:00:00,929,17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9b0bcfe881b6c90f76dfe7a913b0e022682ceb5

10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul1165,"A Detailed Case Study on Deviation, Out-of-Specification(OOS) and CAPA Generation in Pharmaceutical Industry","This review provide an overview of the various documentation of quality management system, which includes deviations, OOS and CAPA. A detailed case study of deviations, out-of-Specification and CAPA generation is beneficial for improving pharmaceutical capabilities and understanding the documentation associated with a quality management system. It is essential for understanding deviations and out-of-spec in the pharmaceutical industry. The quality of medicines means that they meet the required specifications. The quality management system in the pharmaceutical industry is essential because the drugs or pharmaceutical products are delivered directly to the customer's body. Therefore, identity, purity, safety, and the quality of the products are critical. A Deviation can define as ""a deviation from an approved instruction or established standard"" The deviation process helps identify potential risks to product quality and patient safety and establish the root cause.

10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul195,Using Machine Learning to Identify Diseases and Perform Sorting in Apple Fruit,"Fruit diseases play a major role in global agriculture, leading to substantial crop losses and influencing food production and economic stability. In this age of Industry 4.0 the fruit sorting is an important part in the food processing wherein this work plays a vital role. In this study, a solution for the detection and classification of apple fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. Deep learning models offer promise for automating disease identification using fruit images, but encounter obstacles such as therequirement for extensive training data, computational complexity, and the risk of overfitting. This study introduces an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture aimed at addressing these challenges by incorporating a reduced number of layers, thus alleviating computational burdens while maintaining performance. Additionally, augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are employed to diversify the training set without additional image acquisition. Our CNN model is specifically trained to identify common apple crop diseases like Scab, Rot, and Blotch. Rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness ofour model, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 95.37%. Significantly, our model demonstrates reduced storage requirements and faster execution times compared to existing deep CNN architectures, enabling deployment on handheld devices and resource-limited environments. While other CNN models may offer similar accuracy levels, our approach emphasizes efficiency and resource optimization, rendering it practical for real-world applications in agriculture. Furthermore, our CNN model exhibits resilience to environmental variations and imaging parameters, enhancing its applicability across diverse agricultural settings. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the approach developed in this experimental work contributes to modernizing fruits and vegetables sorting operations in food processing, crop management practices thus promoting agricultural sustainability. The scalability and portability of our model make it suitable for deployment in both small-scale farms and large-scale agricultural operations.",2024.0,2024-07-25 00:00:00,926,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d2c38b39f73003ec23ee3e2382e319e20bd5d18

Results We structured the data model for cognate ligand binding site annotations in UniProtKB and performed a complete reannotation of all cognate ligand binding sites using stable unique identifiers from ChEBI, which we now use as the reference vocabulary for all such annotations. We developed improved search and query facilities for cognate ligands in the UniProt website, REST API and SPARQL endpoint that leverage the chemical structure data, nomenclature, and classification that ChEBI provides. Availability Binding site annotations for cognate ligands described using ChEBI are available for UniProtKB protein sequence records in several formats (text, XML, and RDF), and are freely available to query and download through the UniProt website (www.uniprot.org), REST API (www.uniprot.org/help/api), SPARQL endpoint (sparql.uniprot.org/), and FTP site (https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/).

Here, we present decoupleR, a Bioconductor package containing computational methods to extract these activities within a unified framework. decoupleR allows us to flexibly run any method with a given resource, including methods that leverage mode of regulation and weights of interactions. Using decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of methods on transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments. Our findings suggest that simple linear models and the consensus score across methods perform better than other methods at predicting perturbed regulators. Availability and Implementation decoupleR is open source available in Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/decoupleR.html).

In this context, the present research comes to connect the local sustainable tourism development with the sporting events, and to come up with relevant proposals for the reference area, but also for their generalization in the whole tourist areas. Based on the research purpose, a quantitative research was conducted on a sample of 448 residents, randomly selected from a sampling frame. Several scales from previous studies were used to collect primary data, and they were adapted according to the research purpose. Research findings indicate that the acceptance of sustainable tourism development through sports can be predicted by several variables, such as the economic impact (b = 0.343), residents’ attitude towards sports events (b = 0.287), and citizens’ tendency to entrepreneurship (b = 0.113). Additionally, sports events affect the tendency of citizens towards entrepreneurship (r = 0.519, p < 0.01).

10.3390/electronics10161876,IoT Botnet Anomaly Detection Using Unsupervised Deep Learning,"The Internet of Things has become a cutting-edge technology that is continuously evolving in size, connectivity, and applicability. This ecosystem makes its presence felt in every aspect of our lives, along with all other emerging technologies. Unfortunately, despite the significant benefits brought by the IoT, the increased attack surface built upon it has become more critical than ever. Devices have limited resources and are not typically created with security features. Lately, a trend of botnet threats transitioning to the IoT environment has been observed, and an army of infected IoT devices can expand quickly and be used for effective attacks. Therefore, identifying proper solutions for securing IoT systems is currently an important and challenging research topic. Machine learning-based approaches are a promising alternative, allowing the identification of abnormal behaviors and the detection of attacks. This paper proposes an anomaly-based detection solution that uses unsupervised deep learning techniques to identify IoT botnet activities. An empirical evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on both balanced and unbalanced datasets to assess its threat detection capability. False-positive rate reduction and its impact on the detection system are also analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison with other unsupervised learning approaches is included.

However, its reliability has been a concern, possibly due to its high-dimensional nature. This study aims to quantitatively investigate the impact of randomly generated irrelevant features on MRI radiomics feature selection, modeling, and performance by progressively adding randomly generated features. Two multiparametric-MRI radiomics PC datasets were used (dataset 1 (n = 260), dataset 2 (n = 100)). The endpoint was to differentiate pathology-confirmed clinically significant (Gleason score (GS) ≥ 7) from insignificant (GS < 7) PC. Random features were generated at 12 levels with a 10% increment from 0% to 100% and an additional 5%. Three feature selection algorithms and two classifiers were used to build the models. The area under the curve and accuracy were used to evaluate the model’s performance. Feature importance was calculated to assess features’ contributions to the models. The metrics of each model were compared using an ANOVA test with a Bonferroni correction. A slight tendency to select more random features with the increasing number of random features introduced to the datasets was observed. However, the performance of the radiomics-built models was not significantly affected, which was partially due to the higher contribution of radiomics features toward the models compared to the random features. These reliability effects also vary among datasets. In conclusion, while the inclusion of additional random features may still slightly impact the performance of the feature selection, it may not have a substantial impact on the MRI radiomics model performance.",2023.0,2023-12-01 00:00:00,3,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9bfebc54466ed28d73ba8b4f282d5cb4419f60b8

10.1039/d2cp05083h,Bayesian chemical reaction neural network for autonomous kinetic uncertainty quantification.,"Chemical reaction neural network (CRNN), a recently developed tool for autonomous discovery of reaction models, has been successfully demonstrated on a variety of chemical engineering and biochemical systems. It leverages the extraordinary data-fitting capacity of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) while preserving high interpretability and robustness by embedding widely applicable physical laws such as the law of mass action and the Arrhenius law. In this paper, we further developed Bayesian CRNN to not only reconstruct but also quantify the uncertainty of chemical kinetic models from data. Two methods, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and variational inference, were used to perform the Bayesian CRNN, with the latter mainly adopted for its speed. We demonstrated the capability of Bayesian CRNN in the kinetic uncertainty quantification of different types of chemical systems and discussed the importance of embedding physical laws in data-driven modeling. Finally, we discussed the adaptation of Bayesian CRNN for incomplete measurements and model mixing for global uncertainty quantification.",2023.0,2023-01-20 00:00:00,17,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9613157f06612f3c5425eee124b52187050b04ac

The MobileNetV2 network serves as the model since its network design is simple. Therefore, it is likely that the suggested approach will be deployed further on mobile devices. In addition, the transfer learning and experimental learning paradigms. Because it is such a lightweight net, the MobileNetV2 system serves as the foundational model. Results on Robusta coffee leaf disease datasets indicate that the suggested technique can achieve a high level of accuracy, up to 99.93%. The accuracy of other architectures besides MobileNetV2 such as DenseNet169 is 99.74%, ResNet50 architecture is 99.41%, and InceptionResNetV2 architecture is 99.09%.",2022.0,2022-12-01 00:00:00,12,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c94edba52bcece4d5f9cea6c4d05fa4b36b514e
10.4186/ej.2022.26.10.57,Pushing the Accuracy of Thai Food Image Classification with Transfer Learning,". Food image classification is a challenging problem, the solution of which can be of great benefit to many real-world applications such as nutrition and allergy estimation. Most of the previous studies proposed to use variations of convolutional neural networks to tackle the problem. However, due to the limited number of annotated food image datasets, there is still some room for improvement, especially in terms of accuracy and speed. Generally speaking, neural networks trained to solve image classification problems on a small dataset benefit from utilizing the weights of the networks that have been pre-trained on a large image classification dataset such as ImageNet. In this paper, we compare the trade-offs between training networks from scratch, deploying pre-trained networks as feature extractors, and fine-tuning the networks for Thai food image classification. By utilizing Transfer Learning with EfficientNetV1, we were able to achieve higher accuracy for Thai Food Image Classification on the largest publicly available Thai food image dataset, THFOOD-50. In particular, our proposed method improves upon the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art method from 84.06% to 91.49% while maintaining the speed for the prediction at 103 ms and 1205 ms for GPU and CPU, respectively.",2022.0,2022-10-31 00:00:00,5,53,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d97f2bc35be350d8c420bfcb32a6699f85a6d3a8

To protect birds and the diversity of species on earth, it is urgent to build an automatic bird image recognition system. Therefore, this paper assesses the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning models on image recognition. Also, the help-ability of transfer learning in the field of image recognition is tested to evaluate the best model for bird recognition systems. Three groups of classifiers for bird recognition were constructed, namely, classifiers based on the traditional machine learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning-based convolutional neural networks. After experiments, these three classifiers showed significant differences in the classification effect on the Kaggle-180-birds dataset. The experimental results finally prove that deep learning is more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms in image recognition as the number of bird species increases. Besides, the obtained results show that when the sample data is small, transfer learning can help the deep neural network classifier to improve classification accuracy.",2022.0,2022-08-01 00:00:00,16,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/505e677d9eb4770ba7f309c315b29c2be2567dd1

This could be solved through automatic identification and diagnoses using deep learning. However, this technology is not yet explored and examined in the case of peanut leaf spot disease due to some aspects, such as the availability of sufficient data to be used for training and testing the model. This study is intended to explore the use of pre-trained visual geometry group–16 (VGG16), visual geometry group–19 (VGG19), InceptionV3, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 architectures and deep learning optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Momentum, adaptive moment estimation (Adam), root mean square propagation (RMSProp), and adaptive gradient algorithm (Adagrad) in creating a model that can identify leaf spot disease by using a total of 1,000 images of leaves captured using a mobile camera. Confusion matrix was used to assess the accuracy and precision of the results. The result of the study shows that DenseNet-169 trained using SGD with momentum, Adam, and RMSProp attained the highest accuracy of 98%, while DenseNet-169 trained using RMSProp achieved the highest precision of 98% among pre-trained deep convolutional neural network architectures. Furthermore, this result could be beneficial in agricultural automation and disease identification systems for peanut or groundnut plants.",2022.0,2022-06-01 00:00:00,20,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/409a0534830e225492c4150b7332a9eceb5debb6

We describe and propose approaches for assessing heterogeneity in predictor effects and predictions arising from models based on data from different sources. These methods are illustrated in a case study with patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, where we aim to predict 6‐month mortality based on individual patient data using meta‐analytic techniques (15 studies, n = 11 022 patients).

10.1136/bmj.i6,"Net benefit approaches to the evaluation of prediction models, molecular markers, and diagnostic tests","Many decisions in medicine involve trade-offs, such as between diagnosing patients with disease versus unnecessary additional testing for those who are healthy. Net benefit is an increasingly reported decision analytic measure that puts benefits and harms on the same scale. This is achieved by specifying an exchange rate, a clinical judgment of the relative value of benefits (such as detecting a cancer) and harms (such as unnecessary biopsy) associated with models, markers, and tests. The exchange rate can be derived by asking simple questions, such as the maximum number of patients a doctor would recommend for biopsy to find one cancer. As the answers to these sorts of questions are subjective, it is possible to plot net benefit for a range of reasonable exchange rates in a “decision curve.” For clinical prediction models, the exchange rate is related to the probability threshold to determine whether a patient is classified as being positive or negative for a disease. Net benefit is useful for determining whether basing clinical decisions on a model, marker, or test would do more good than harm. This is in contrast to traditional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are statistical abstractions not directly informative about clinical value. Recent years have seen an increase in practical applications of net benefit analysis to research data. This is a welcome development, since decision analytic techniques are of particular value when the purpose of a model, marker, or test is to help doctors make better clinical decisions.",2016.0,2016-01-25 00:00:00,748,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45d1e781dcdb5464fe0859888df799309c56fd46

10.3390/make5030061,Early Thyroid Risk Prediction by Data Mining and Ensemble Classifiers,"Thyroid disease is among the most prevalent endocrinopathies worldwide. As the thyroid gland controls human metabolism, thyroid illness is a matter of concern for human health. To save time and reduce error rates, an automatic, reliable, and accurate thyroid identification machine-learning (ML) system is essential. The proposed model aims to address existing work limitations such as the lack of detailed feature analysis, visualization, improvement in prediction accuracy, and reliability. Here, a public thyroid illness dataset containing 29 clinical features from the University of California, Irvine ML repository was used. The clinical features helped us to build an ML model that can predict thyroid illness by analyzing early symptoms and replacing the manual analysis of these attributes. Feature analysis and visualization facilitate an understanding of the role of features in thyroid prediction tasks. In addition, the overfitting problem was eliminated by 5-fold cross-validation and data balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Ensemble learning ensures prediction model reliability owing to the involvement of multiple classifiers in the prediction decisions. The proposed model achieved 99.5% accuracy, 99.39% sensitivity, and 99.59% specificity with the boosting method which is applicable to real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to ease diagnosis and promote early treatment.",2023.0,2023-09-18 00:00:00,15,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c19212cf929834232dc60baef0670dbea2b40adc

Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, 3194 SPECT thyroid images were collected for model training (n=2067), internal validation (n=514) and external validation (n=613). First, four pretrained DCNN models (AlexNet, ShuffleNetV2, MobileNetV3 and ResNet-34) for were tested multiple medical image classification of thyroid disease types (i.e., Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, thyroid tumor and normal thyroid). The best performing model was then subjected to fivefold cross-validation to further assess its performance, and the diagnostic performance of this model was compared with that of junior and senior nuclear medicine physicians. Finally, class-specific attentional regions were visualized with attention heatmaps using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Results Each of the four pretrained neural networks attained an overall accuracy of more than 0.85 for the classification of SPECT thyroid images. The improved ResNet-34 model performed best, with an accuracy of 0.944. For the internal validation set, the ResNet-34 model showed higher accuracy (p < 0.001) when compared to that of the senior nuclear medicine physician, with an improvement of nearly 10%. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.931 for the external dataset, a significantly higher accuracy than that of the senior physician (0.931 vs. 0.868, p < 0.001). Conclusion The DCNN-based model performed well in terms of diagnosing thyroid scintillation images. The DCNN model showed higher sensitivity and greater specificity in identifying Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid tumors compared to those of nuclear medicine physicians, illustrating the feasibility of deep learning models to improve the diagnostic efficiency for assisting clinicians.",2023.0,2023-08-11 00:00:00,14,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30007c2f405fe460cf0dd93ea2f4ea3266a4d165

10.3390/s21030930,Research on the Prediction of Green Plum Acidity Based on Improved XGBoost,"The acidity of green plum has an important influence on the fruit’s deep processing. Traditional physical and chemical analysis methods for green plum acidity detection are destructive, time-consuming, and unable to achieve online detection. In response, a rapid and non-destructive detection method based on hyperspectral imaging technology was studied in this paper. Research on prediction performance comparisons between supervised learning methods and unsupervised learning methods is currently popular. To further improve the accuracy of component prediction, a new hyperspectral imaging system was developed, and the kernel principle component analysis—linear discriminant analysis—extreme gradient boosting algorithm (KPCA-LDA-XGB) model was proposed to predict the acidity of green plum. The KPCA-LDA-XGB model is a supervised learning model combined with the extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental results proved that the KPCA-LDA-XGB model offers good acidity predictions for green plum, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.829 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.107 for the prediction set. Compared with the basic XGBoost model, the KPCA-LDA-XGB model showed a 79.4% increase in R and a 31.2% decrease in RMSE. The use of linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial (Poly) kernel functions were also compared and analyzed in this paper to further optimize the KPCA-LDA-XGB model.",2021.0,2021-01-30 00:00:00,21,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/034d860700ee788ff8d5513b5c6a80da66968b4a

10.1002/imt2.36,"Sangerbox: A comprehensive, interaction‐friendly clinical bioinformatics analysis platform","Abstract In recent decades, with the continuous development of high‐throughput sequencing technology, data volume in medical research has increased, at the same time, almost all clinical researchers have their own independent omics data, which provided a better condition for data mining and a deeper understanding of gene functions. However, for these large amounts of data, many common and cutting‐edge effective bioinformatics research methods still cannot be widely used. This has encouraged the establishment of many analytical platforms, a portion of databases or platforms were designed to solve the special analysis needs of users, for instance, MG RAST, IMG/M, Qiita, BIGSdb, and TRAPR were developed for specific omics research, and some databases or servers provide solutions for special problems solutions. Metascape was designed to only provide functional annotations of genes as well as function enrichment analysis; BioNumerics and RidomSeqSphere+ perform multilocus sequence typing; CARD provides only antimicrobial resistance annotations. Additionally, some web services are outdated, and inefficient interaction often fails to meet the needs of researchers, such as our previous versions of the platform. Therefore, the demand to complete massive data processing tasks urgently requires a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis platform. Hence, we have developed a website platform, Sangerbox 3.0 (http://vip.sangerbox.com/), a web‐based tool platform. On a user‐friendly interface that also supports differential analysis, the platform provides interactive customizable analysis tools, including various kinds of correlation analyses, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted correlation network analysis, and other common tools and functions, users only need to upload their own corresponding data into Sangerbox 3.0, select required parameters, submit, and wait for the results after the task has been completed. We have also established a new interactive plotting system that allows users to adjust the parameters in the image; moreover, optimized plotting performance enables users to adjust large‐capacity vector maps on the web site. At the same time, we have integrated GEO, TCGA, ICGC, and other databases and processed data in batches, greatly reducing the difficulty to obtain data and improving the efficiency of bioimformatics study for users. Finally, we also provide users with rich sources of bioinformatics analysis courses, offering a platform for researchers to share and exchange knowledge.",2022.0,2022-07-08 00:00:00,596,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fabff697cd0ec343490f89e8e6587200d97f378
10.3389/fimmu.2022.871312,Characterization of Two TNF-Related Subtypes Predicting Infliximab Therapy Responses in Crohn’s Disease,"Background Anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is widely used to treat Crohn’s disease (CD). Unfortunately, 10%–40% of patients have primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy. TNF family genes play crucial roles in inflammation and immune regulation; however, the effects of TNF family genes on CD remain unclear. Methods CD expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Unsupervised clustering was then used to identify the gene subtypes in CD based on the expressions of TNF family genes. The features of the gene subtypes were characterized using functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses, and biomarkers of the gene subtypes were identified. Results Patients with CD were divided on the basis of unsupervised clustering into two gene subtypes: immune and metabolic. Gene subtype A was significantly correlated with leukocyte migration and cytokine interactions, whereas gene subtype B was associated with metabolic pathways. Whereas 89.5% of the patients in gene subtype B responded to infliximab, only 16.7% of patients in gene subtype A responded. In addition, a combination of interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), interleukin 6 (IL6), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) can effectively distinguish between gene subtypes A and B. Conclusion Comprehensive analyses of the TNF family genes may reveal the underlying pathogenesis of CD. The classification of subtypes may provide new ideas for the personalized treatment of patients with CD.",2022.0,2022-04-22 00:00:00,4,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03327d34c5a42b422a0ce9596f4ca6c7767f1425

10.2147/JIR.S338053,Construction of ceRNA Network to Reveal Potential Biomarkers in Crohn’s Disease and Validation in a TNBS Induced Mice Model,"Purpose We aimed to construct a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and explore the potential biomarkers in Crohn’s disease (CD) via bioinformatics analysis. Validation of candidate biomarkers in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced experimental colitis model and ceRNA network in an HCT116 cell line was also an aim, along with purposing to reveal the pathogenesis of CD. Methods GSE102134 and GSE67106 datasets were obtained and used to screen the differentially expressed genes. WCGNA was applied to identify the relative model to construct the ceRNA network. Furthermore, the relationship between candidate gene and immune infiltration was investigated. Then, the expression of potential biomarkers was validated via qRT-PCR in a TNBS induced experimental colitis model. Finally, the ceRNA network was confirmed by RNAi experiments in an HCT116 cell line. Results The ceRNA network, consisting of four lncRNAs, four miRNAs, and eight mRNAs, was constructed and the ROC analysis showed four mRNAs (PTGS2, LPL, STAT1, and TRIB2) had high diagnostic accuracy (AUC>0.9). In addition, upregulated PTGS2 was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including Natural killer cells, exhausted T-cells, monocytes, and Dendritic cells. The outcome of this TNBS induced experimental colitis model verified that the expression of PTGS2 and mir-429 was consistent with results of previous bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the predicted ceRNA network MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 were validated via RNA interference. Knockout of MIR3142HG decreased the mRNA level of PTGS2, whereas inhibition of mir-429 increased the mRNA level of PTGS2 in the HCT116 cell line. Conclusion The exploration of the ceRNA network in this work might contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of CD. The constructed MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 ceRNA network may play a role in CD, and PTGS2 can be a potential immune-related biomarker in CD.",2021.0,2021-12-01 00:00:00,7,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a80c4f36fffb31d3ec222d31aba34a185d35e2d
10.4049/jimmunol.2100220,Regulation and Role of αE Integrin and Gut Homing Integrins in Migration and Retention of Intestinal Lymphocytes during Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Key Points Adhesion molecules are upregulated in inflamed intestinal mucosa in IBD patients. Baseline β7 expression does not impact αE induction or gene expression in T cells. Phospho-SMAD3 is increased in inflamed mucosa in IBD. Targeting interactions between α4β7 integrin and endothelial adhesion molecule MAdCAM-1 to inhibit lymphocyte migration to the gastrointestinal tract is an effective therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Following lymphocyte entry into the mucosa, a subset of these cells expresses αEβ7 integrin, which is expressed on proinflammatory lymphocytes, to increase cell retention. The factors governing lymphocyte migration into the intestinal mucosa and αE integrin expression in healthy subjects and IBD patients remain incompletely understood. We evaluated changes in factors involved in lymphocyte migration and differentiation within tissues. Both ileal and colonic tissue from active IBD patients showed upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1 at the gene and protein levels compared with healthy subjects and/or inactive IBD patients. β1 and β7 integrin expression on circulating lymphocytes was similar across groups. TGF-β1 treatment induced expression of αE on both β7+ and β7− T cells, suggesting that cells entering the mucosa independently of MAdCAM-1/α4β7 can become αEβ7+. ITGAE gene polymorphisms did not alter protein induction following TGF-β1 stimulation. Increased phospho-SMAD3, which is directly downstream of TGF-β, and increased TGF-β–responsive gene expression were observed in the colonic mucosa of IBD patients. Finally, in vitro stimulation experiments showed that baseline β7 expression had little effect on cytokine, chemokine, transcription factor, and effector molecule gene expression in αE+ and αE− T cells. These findings suggest cell migration to the gut mucosa may be altered in IBD and α4β7−, and α4β7+ T cells may upregulate αEβ7 in response to TGF-β once within the gut mucosa.",2021.0,2021-09-24 00:00:00,36,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d0dfd779771e884ac2d8b53e5c6c4e2f45a4bd4

10.3390/w14203242,Assessment of Activating Reservoir Emergency Storage in Climate-Change-Fueled Extreme Drought,"With exacerbating climate change, the current reservoir storage capacity in South Korea is insufficient to meet the future scheduled water demand. No study has yet evaluated the effects of applying the water supply adjustment standard (Standard) and activating the reservoir emergency storage in response to extreme drought. The main objective is to assess the effects of applying Standard and activating emergency storage in meeting the water demand under extreme drought at six multipurpose reservoirs (Andong, Gimcheon-Buhang, Gunwi, Hapcheon, Imha, and Milyang) in the Nakdong River Basin, South Korea. We built a reservoir simulation model (HEC-ResSim), determined the extreme drought scenarios, and emergency storage capacity. We evaluated three reservoir operation cases (general operation, regular Standard, and revised Standard) from 2011 to 2100. The results show that applying the Standard and activating the emergency storage are effective in meeting the future water demand during extreme drought. In conclusion, we need to secure 110 million cubic meters (MCM) (Hapcheon reservoir) and 8 MCM (Gunwi reservoir) of water to reduce the number of days in the emergency stage. This research serves as a fundamental study that can help establish Standard and emergency storage activation criteria for other multipurpose reservoirs in preparation for extreme drought.",2022.0,2022-10-14 00:00:00,5,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36562749b4b402552304535868d9a929e0d8c01f

10.3390/bioengineering10010027,Advancement in the Cuffless and Noninvasive Measurement of Blood Pressure: A Review of the Literature and Open Challenges,"Hypertension is a chronic condition that is one of the prominent reasons behind cardiovascular disease, brain stroke, and organ failure. Left unnoticed and untreated, the deterioration in a health condition could even result in mortality. If it can be detected early, with proper treatment, undesirable outcomes can be avoided. Until now, the gold standard is the invasive way of measuring blood pressure (BP) using a catheter. Additionally, the cuff-based and noninvasive methods are too cumbersome or inconvenient for frequent measurement of BP. With the advancement of sensor technology, signal processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms, researchers are trying to find the perfect relationships between biomedical signals and changes in BP. This paper is a literature review of the studies conducted on the cuffless noninvasive measurement of BP using biomedical signals. Relevant articles were selected using specific criteria, then traditional techniques for BP measurement were discussed along with a motivation for cuffless measurement use of biomedical signals and machine learning algorithms. The review focused on the progression of different noninvasive cuffless techniques rather than comparing performance among different studies. The literature survey concluded that the use of deep learning proved to be the most accurate among all the cuffless measurement techniques. On the other side, this accuracy has several disadvantages, such as lack of interpretability, computationally extensive, standard validation protocol, and lack of collaboration with health professionals. Additionally, the continuing work by researchers is progressing with a potential solution for these challenges. Finally, future research directions have been provided to encounter the challenges.",2022.0,2022-12-24 00:00:00,17,236,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e2ec188e6b058e8a7b42bc0da00c79d218d6bc2
10.3390/s22166195,Recent Advances in Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring and Prediction Using a Machine Learning Approach,"Blood pressure (BP) monitoring can be performed either invasively via arterial catheterization or non-invasively through a cuff sphygmomanometer. However, for conscious individuals, traditional cuff-based BP monitoring devices are often uncomfortable, intermittent, and impractical for frequent measurements. Continuous and non-invasive BP (NIBP) monitoring is currently gaining attention in the human health monitoring area due to its promising potentials in assessing the health status of an individual, enabled by machine learning (ML), for various purposes such as early prediction of disease and intervention treatment. This review presents the development of a non-invasive BP measuring tool called sphygmomanometer in brief, summarizes state-of-the-art NIBP sensors, and identifies extended works on continuous NIBP monitoring using commercial devices. Moreover, the NIBP predictive techniques including pulse arrival time, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, and ML are elaborated on the basis of bio-signals acquisition from these sensors. Additionally, the different BP values (systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure) of the various ML models adopted in several reported studies are compared in terms of the international validation standards developed by the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) for clinically-approved BP monitors. Finally, several challenges and possible solutions for the implementation and realization of continuous NIBP technology are addressed.",2022.0,2022-08-01 00:00:00,27,118,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/906ee6b00500d1dda9c9472d5dfcc8e6320b0127

However, in practice, there is no universal FHE scheme that is effi-cient in all possible use cases. In this work, we show that FHE schemes suitable for arithmetic circuits (e.g. BGV or BFV) have a similar performance as FHE schemes for non-arithmetic circuits (TFHE) in basic comparison tasks such as less-than, maximum and minimum operations. Our implementation of the less-than function in the HElib library is up to 3 times faster than the prior work based on BGV/BFV.

This work demonstrates a new hollow core optical fiber based on a different guiding mechanism, which confines light with a cladding made of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material through total internal reflection. We show that the addition of a layer of ENZ material coating (e.g. indium tin oxide layer) significantly reduces the loss of the waveguide compared to the structure without the ENZ layer. We also show that the propagation loss of the ENZ hollow core fiber can be further improved by integrating ENZ materials with lower loss. This study presents a novel type of hollow core fiber, and can find advanced in-fiber photonic applications such as laser surgery/spectroscopy, novel gas-filled/discharge laser, in-fiber molecular/gas sensing, and low-latency optical fiber communication.",2024.0,2024-03-01 00:00:00,2,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d14e92544be4cf2129ea004e1d3a0fec9388eb2e

Up until now, no discussion of phase transitions of nodal lines in photonic crystals using the Euler class has been reported, despite the fact that the Euler class and topological phase transition have recently been addressed in metallic or acoustic crystals. Here, we show how the deformation of a photonic crystal causes topological phase transitions in the nodal lines, and the Euler class can be used to theoretically predict the nodal lines’ stability based on the non-Abelian topological charge theory. Specifically, by manipulating the separation between the two single diamond structures and the extent of structural distortion, we numerically demonstrate the topological transition of nodal lines, e.g., from nodal lines to nodal rings. We then demonstrate that the range of surface states is strongly influenced by the topological phase transition of nodal lines. Moreover, the Zak phase was used to explain the surface states’ existence.",2024.0,2024-02-23 00:00:00,1,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03865e2c2ba5702ae1ecdbb08d9f2e1f199b3849
10.1515/nanoph-2023-0824,Thermally tunable binary-phase VO2 metasurfaces for switchable holography and digital encryption,"Abstract Metasurface holography has aroused immense interest in producing holographic images with high quality, higher-order diffraction-free, and large viewing angles by using a planar artificial sheet consisting of subwavelength nanostructures. Despite remarkable progress, dynamically tunable metasurface holography in the visible band has rarely been reported due to limited available tuning methods. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate a thermally tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanofin based binary-phase metasurface, which generates holographic information in the visible varying with temperature. The insulator-to-metal phase transition in VO2 nanofins allows two independent binary-phase holograms generated by machine learning to be encoded in the respective phases of VO2 and switched under thermal regulation. By elaborately designing the dimensions and compensated phase of VO2 nanofins, high-quality images are reconstructed at corresponding temperatures under appropriate chiral illumination. In contrast, much poorer images are produced under inappropriate chiral illumination. We further demonstrate the advantage of applying the VO2 phase-compensated metasurface in high-security digital encryption, where two desired character combinations are read out with appropriate excitations and temperatures, whereas one identical fraudulent message is received with inappropriate excitations. Our design approach offers a new and efficient method to realize tunable metasurfaces, which is promisingly adopted in dynamic display, information encryption, optical anti-counterfeiting, etc.",2024.0,2024-02-21 00:00:00,14,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21004e072bc910d007350615765b2f6bf49ac5e8

10.1371/journal.pone.0215030,"Pilots and athletes: Different concerns, similar concussion non-disclosure","Objectives Concussion non-disclosure research has focused almost exclusively on athletes. The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes’ demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons. Methods We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy. Results The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p < 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.50).

10.3390/en16062628,A Future with Machine Learning: Review of Condition Assessment of Structures and Mechanical Systems in Nuclear Facilities,"The nuclear industry is exploring applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including autonomous control and management of reactors and components. A condition assessment framework that utilizes AI and sensor data is an important part of such an autonomous control system. A nuclear power plant has various structures, systems, and components (SSCs) such as piping-equipment that carries coolant to the reactor. Piping systems can degrade over time because of flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion. Any cracks and leakages can cause loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The current industry standards for conducting maintenance of vital SSCs can be time and cost-intensive. AI can play a greater role in the condition assessment and can be extended to recognize concrete degradation (chloride-induced damage and alkali–silica reaction) before cracks develop. This paper reviews developments in condition assessment and AI applications of structural and mechanical systems. The applicability of existing techniques to nuclear systems is somewhat limited because its response requires characterization of high and low-frequency vibration modes, whereas previous studies focus on systems where a single vibration mode can define the degraded state. Data assimilation and storage is another challenging aspect of autonomous control. Advances in AI and data mining world can help to address these challenges.",2023.0,2023-03-10 00:00:00,18,180,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d7da5e49d1458ca419393a872913da9aa092c62

10.1371/journal.pone.0265598,Sub-micrometer morphology of human atherosclerotic plaque revealed by synchrotron radiation-based μCT—A comparison with histology,"Histology is a long standing and well-established gold standard for pathological characterizations. In recent years however, synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SRμCT) has become a tool for extending the imaging of two-dimensional thin sections into three-dimensional imaging of tissue blocks, enabling so-called virtual histology with arbitrary clipping planes, volumetric rendering and automatic segmentation. In this study, we present a thorough characterization of human carotid plaques after endarterectomy of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), investigating several different pathologic structures using both SRμCT and histology. Phase-contrast SRμCT was performed with two different magnifications (voxel sizes 6.5 μm and 0.65 μm, respectively), and histology was performed with multiple different stainings (Alpha-actin, Glycophorin A, von Kossa, Movat, CD68). The 0.65 μm high-resolution SRμCT was performed on selected areas with plaque typical relevant morphology, identified on the 6.5 μm low-resolution SRμCT. The tomography datasets were reconstructed with additional 3D volume rendering and compared to histology. In total, nine different regions with typical pathologic structures were identified and imaged with high-resolution SRμCT. The results show many characteristics typical for advanced atherosclerotic plaques, clinically relevant, namely ruptures with thrombosis, neo-vascularization, inflammatory infiltrates in shoulder regions, lipid rich necrotic cores (LRNC), thin fibrous cap, calcifications, lumen irregularities, and changes in vessel wall structures such as the internal elastic membrane. This method’s non-destructive nature renders details of micro-structures with an excellent visual likeness to histology, with the additional strength of multiplanar and 3D visualization and the possibility of multiple re-scans.",2022.0,2022-04-26 00:00:00,4,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db47e2993091431e419e8ce59ac9a3e20f6aa4eb

Most beers are produced in modern and technologically advanced breweries that use high quality raw materials, thus resulting in minor differences of physical–chemical properties between various beers (of the same style). However, consumers focus on constant quality and sensory properties of their chosen beer. Sensory evaluation is not an easy task and involves flexible methods for determination of differences and changes between beers.

A human taste panel was conducted to assess the potential of infant formula milk (Aptamil® 1) to mask the taste of two model WHO priority medicines, zinc sulfate and paracetamol, manufactured as dispersible tablets. Simultaneously, the palatability of powder blends of the tablet platforms was assessed. Twenty healthy adult volunteers performed a swirl-and-spit assessment of placebos and API-containing blends in either a lactose-based or a mannitol-based dispersible tablet platform, reconstituted in 10 mL of either water or Aptamil® 1. Eighteen samples were rated for aversion using a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale, grittiness using a 5-point Likert scale, and “acceptability-as-a-medicine” evaluated as: “Would you find this sample acceptable to swallow as a medicine?” with binary answers of Yes/No. The API-containing formulations were more aversive than the placebos; the paracetamol-containing samples being more aversive than zinc sulfate samples. The platforms themselves were not aversive. Non-gritty samples had four-fold greater odds of being acceptable as a medicine. Aptamil® 1 masked the taste of zinc sulfate in the mannitol-based formulation but did not mask the taste of paracetamol in either platform, suggesting a limited taste-masking ability, which may be API and formulation dependent.",2022.0,2022-02-01 00:00:00,4,47,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7fd12a9f8cdf0b88ca5016cba004138590aaf496
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004777,The Maximum Entropy Fallacy Redux?,"Protein structure can be predicted in silico given sufficiently good templates, as demonstrated in successive installments of the biannual Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition [1]. Since the number of known protein sequences currently increases much faster than the number of known protein structures, and is likely to continue to do so in the foreseeable future, reliable ab initio protein structure prediction, without recourse to templates, would be highly desirable. It is currently not possible to achieve sufficient sampling in unrestrained folding to achieve predictions close to the native structure. Recently, very important progress has been made on the restricted problem of predicting spatial amino acid contacts in proteins from many homologous sequences [2]. While it is not yet clear if these techniques, collectively known as direct coupling analysis (DCA), can be leveraged to systematically predict full protein structures, preliminary results indicate that this may be the case [3,4]. DCA has also been used with success for several related problems, such as predicting structures of protein complexes [4] or alternative protein conformations [5]. 
 
The central ingredient in DCA is to learn generative probabilistic models from a set of homologous protein sequences. These models are chosen from an exponential family with linear and quadratic interactions, commonly referred to as Potts models (see Eq 1) [6]. In the literature, this procedure has been motivated by maximum entropy arguments [7–10]. In this Perspective, I will point out that these arguments are mistaken and that the successes of DCA can have nothing to do with maximum entropy. To the contrary, maximum entropy hides the real nature and questions raised by DCA and is thus an obstacle to progress. In addition, maximum entropy has a long and contested history in statistical physics, the field in which it was first introduced [11,12]. Definite and precise results derived in the last decade and a half have here conclusively falsified maximum entropy. Appeals to maximum entropy are therefore prejudicial to a more general acceptance and adoption of DCA.",2016.0,2016-05-01 00:00:00,21,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10ab4835c2d9517f6f94086beb81cc07aa34a9b6

10.1093/nar/gkv1344,The Pfam protein families database: towards a more sustainable future,"In the last two years the Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org) has undergone a substantial reorganisation to reduce the effort involved in making a release, thereby permitting more frequent releases. Arguably the most significant of these changes is that Pfam is now primarily based on the UniProtKB reference proteomes, with the counts of matched sequences and species reported on the website restricted to this smaller set. Building families on reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the website, whilst still providing access to many important model organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however, still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB sequences can still be retrieved. Some Pfam entries (1.6%) which have no matches to reference proteomes remain; we are working with UniProt to see if sequences from them can be incorporated into reference proteomes. Pfam-B, the automatically-generated supplement to Pfam, has been removed. The current release (Pfam 29.0) includes 16 295 entries and 559 clans.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btu791,MetaPSICOV: combining coevolution methods for accurate prediction of contacts and long range hydrogen bonding in proteins,"Motivation: Recent developments of statistical techniques to infer direct evolutionary couplings between residue pairs have rendered covariation-based contact prediction a viable means for accurate 3D modelling of proteins, with no information other than the sequence required. To extend the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta-predictor (MetaPSICOV) which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence alignments, considers a broad range of other sequence-derived features and, uniquely, a range of metrics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues. Results: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range contacts—around 60% higher than PSICOV, and around 40% better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range hydrogen bonding, MetaPSICOV-HB achieves a precision of 0.69 for the top-L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 for the baseline MetaPSICOV. Availability and implementation: MetaPSICOV is available as a freely available web server at http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/MetaPSICOV.

10.3389/fphys.2022.870657,"Construction of an HLA Classifier for Early Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Recognition of Immunosuppression in Sepsis by Multiple Transcriptome Datasets","Background: Sepsis is a clinical syndrome, due to a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection. Accumulating evidence shows that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play a key role in the immune responses to sepsis. Nevertheless, the effects of HLA genes in sepsis have still not been comprehensively understood. Methods: A systematical search was performed in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases from inception to 10 September 2021. Random forest (RF) and modified Lasso penalized regression were conducted to identify hub genes in multi-transcriptome data, thus we constructed a prediction model, namely the HLA classifier. ArrayExpress databases, as external validation, were utilized to evaluate its diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive performance. Immune cell infiltration score was calculated via CIBERSORTx tools and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and ssGSEA were conducted to determine the pathways that are significantly enriched in different subgroups. Next, we systematically correlated the HLA classifier with immunological characteristics from multiple perspectives, such as immune-related cell infiltration, pivotal molecular pathways, and cytokine expression. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate the expression level of HLA genes in clinical samples. Results: A total of nine datasets comprising 1,251 patients were included. Based on RF and modified Lasso penalized regression in multi-transcriptome datasets, five HLA genes (B2M, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2) were identified as hub genes, which were used to construct an HLA classifier. In the discovery cohort, the HLA classifier exhibited superior diagnostic value (AUC = 0.997) and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.716) than clinical characteristics or endotypes. Encouragingly, similar results were observed in the ArrayExpress databases. In the E-MTAB-7581 dataset, the use of hydrocortisone in the HLA high-risk subgroup (OR: 2.84, 95% CI 1.07–7.57, p = 0.037) was associated with increased risk of mortality, but not in the HLA low-risk subgroup. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis by CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA revealed that B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and infiltrating lymphocytes (ILs) were significantly richer in HLA low-risk phenotypes, while Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were more abundant in HLA high-risk phenotypes. The HLA classifier was significantly negatively correlated with B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and ILs, yet was significantly positively correlated with Tregs and MDSCs. Subsequently, molecular pathways analysis uncovered that cytokine-cytokine receptor (CCR) interaction, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and antigen-presenting cell (APC) co-stimulation were significantly enriched in HLA low-risk endotypes, which was significantly negatively correlated with the HLA classifier in multi-transcriptome data. Finally, the expression levels of several cytokines (IL-10, IFNG, TNF) were significantly different between the HLA subgroups, and the ratio of IL-10/TNF was significantly positively correlated with HLA score in multi-transcriptome data. Results of qRT-PCR validated the higher expression level of B2M as well as lower expression level of HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2 in sepsis samples compared to control sample. Conclusion: Based on five HLA genes, a diagnostic and prognostic model, namely the HLA classifier, was established, which is closely correlated with responses to hydrocortisone and immunosuppression status and might facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",2022.0,2022-05-24 00:00:00,15,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca1c6603c34da30ed23d89a312a9906215a28b9b
10.1002/eji.202149410,Innate immune signaling and immunothrombosis: New insights and therapeutic opportunities,"Activation of the coagulation cascade is a critical, evolutionarily conserved mechanism that maintains hemostasis by rapidly forming blood clots in response to blood‐borne infections and damaged blood vessels. Coagulation is a key component of innate immunity since it prevents bacterial dissemination and can provoke inflammation. The term immunothrombosis describes the process by which the innate immune response drives aberrant coagulation, which can result in a lethal condition termed disseminated intravascular coagulation, often seen in sepsis. In this review, we describe the recently uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying inflammasome‐ and STING‐driven immunothrombosis induced by bacterial and viral infections, culminating in tissue factor (TF) activation and release. Current anticoagulant therapeutics, while effective, are associated with a life‐threatening bleeding risk, requiring the urgent development of new treatments. Targeting immunothrombosis may provide a safer option. Thus, we highlight preclinical tools which target TF and/or block canonical (NLRP3) or noncanonical (caspase‐11) inflammasome activation as well as STING‐driven TF release and discuss clinically approved drugs which block key immunothrombotic processes and, therefore, may be redeployed as safer anticoagulants.",2022.0,2022-05-15 00:00:00,19,139,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c7e8de990aca1881ae30bcf3ae751152c787d42

Five cross-sectional surveys (February 2021 to May 2022) were performed during the pandemic assessing physical activity, smartphone usage, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), sleep quality (ISI-7), and stress (PSS-10). In total, N = 7201 adolescents (age: 14–20 years ((MW±SD): 16.63 ± 1.49 years); 70.2% female, 18.8% migration background) participated. A strong increase in mobile phone usage as well as a decrease in physical activity as compared to pre-pandemic data were observed (p < 0.001). Compared to the lowest smartphone user group (<1 h/d), the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for all investigated mental health symptoms increased with increasing smartphone usage up to 3.2–6.8 in high-utilizers (>8 h/d). The aORs for depressive, anxiety, insomnia, and stress symptoms decreased in physically active compared to inactive adolescents. Results highlight the need for measures to promote responsible smartphone usage as well as to increase physical activity, so as to promote mental health in adolescence.",2022.0,2022-07-25 00:00:00,14,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b649f47913b3db21f2c2c6867b24782883ca302
10.3389/fpsyt.2022.870128,Conspiratorial Beliefs About COVID-19 Pandemic - Can They Pose a Mental Health Risk? The Relationship Between Conspiracy Thinking and the Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Adult Poles,"The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic, tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms among the surveyed Poles. The study was conducted via the Internet in a group of 700 people aged 24.8 ± 6.3 years (mean ± SD). 585 females and 110 males were involved. Scales such as Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the original questionnaire COVID-19 Conspiratorial Beliefs Scale (COVID-19 CBS) designed to measure the tendency to believe in false information about COVID-19 pandemic were used. A positive correlation was observed between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 CBS) and the tendency to believe in general conspiracy theories (GCBS) (r = 0.768; p < 0.001). Moreover, both COVID-19 CBS and GCBS positively correlated with the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study group. For COVID-19 CBS, the correlation coefficients were 0.087 (p < 0.021) and.108 (p < 0.004) for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, while for GCBS the coefficients were 0.132 (p < 0.001) and 0.147 (p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the increased tendency to believe in false beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in the severity of anxiety (b = 0.04; p = 0.021) and depression (b = 0.06; p < 0.001) symptoms. It can be hypothesized that the tendency to believe in false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is positively associated with the tendency to general belief in conspiracy theories. False beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may, at least to some extent, influence the development of anxiety and depression symptoms.",2022.0,2022-05-13 00:00:00,9,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4ac35bcaaabe6ea8e9a72c88c0edcf4fa87e903
10.1613/jair.816,An Analysis of Reduced Error Pruning,"Top-down induction of decision trees has been observed to suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase. In particular, it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows linearly with the sample size, even though the accuracy of the tree does not improve. Reduced Error Pruning is an algorithm that has been used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems of decision tree learning. 
 
In this paper we present analyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three different settings. First we study the basic algorithmic properties of the method, properties that hold independent of the input decision tree and pruning examples. Then we examine a situation that intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be replaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute values of the pruning examples are independent of each other. This analysis is conducted under two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis we assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This assumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do not receive any pruning examples. 
 
This paper clarifies the different variants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its algorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis.",2001.0,2001-07-01 00:00:00,124,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01bf75c26b238aea72231f9224f6dbff450c0e7e

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106873,Multi-Source Multi-Domain Data Fusion for Cyberattack Detection in Power Systems,"Modern power systems equipped with advanced communication infrastructure are cyber-physical in nature. The traditional approach of leveraging physical measurements for detecting cyber-induced physical contingencies is insufficient to reflect the accurate cyber-physical states. Moreover, deploying conventional rule-based and anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for cyberattack detection results in higher false positives. Hence, independent usage of detection tools of cyberattacks in cyber and physical sides has a limited capability. In this work, a mechanism to fuse real-time data from cyber and physical domains, to improve situational awareness of the whole system is developed. It is demonstrated how improved situational awareness can help reduce false positives in intrusion detection. This cyber and physical data fusion results in cyber-physical state space explosion which is addressed using different feature transformation and selection techniques. Our fusion engine is further integrated into a cyber-physical power system testbed as an application that collects cyber and power system telemetry from multiple sensors emulating real-world data sources found in a utility. These are synthesized into features for algorithms to detect cyber intrusions. Results are presented using the proposed data fusion application to infer False Data and Command Injection (FDI and FCI)-based Man-in-The-Middle attacks. Post collection, the data fusion application uses time-synchronized merge and extracts features. This is followed by pre-processing such as imputation, categorical encoding, and feature reduction, before training supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning models to evaluate the performance of the intrusion detection system. A major finding is the improvement of detection accuracy by fusion of features from cyber, security, and physical domains. Additionally, it is observed that the semi-supervised co-training technique performs at par with supervised learning methods with the proposed feature vector. The approach and toolset, as well as the dataset that is generated can be utilized to prevent threats such as false data or command injection attacks from being carried out by identifying cyber intrusions accurately.",2021.0,2021-01-18 00:00:00,61,105,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02316c3515bd5e98a78a1b87554196c08fbdedcc

Contrary to what might be expected, the models derived from the CheqSol experimental data are not more accurate than those derived from the ""noisy"" literature data. The results suggest that, at the present time, it is the deficiency of QSPR methods (algorithms and/or descriptor sets), and not, as is commonly quoted, the uncertainty in the experimental measurements, which is the limiting factor in accurately predicting aqueous solubility for pharmaceutical molecules.",2014.0,2014-07-09 00:00:00,101,64,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bfe7b56a06ed995be00b3fb3011b18a8290296ab

We make predictions of solution free energy using physics-based theory alone and using machine learning/quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) models. We also develop machine learning models where the theoretical energies and cheminformatics descriptors are used as combined input. These models are used to predict solvation free energy. While direct theoretical calculation does not give accurate results in this approach, machine learning is able to give predictions with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼1.1 log S units in a 10-fold cross-validation for our Drug-Like-Solubility-100 (DLS-100) dataset of 100 druglike molecules. We find that a model built using energy terms from our theoretical methodology as descriptors is marginally less predictive than one built on Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) descriptors. Combining both sets of descriptors allows a further but very modest improvement in the predictions. However, in some cases, this is a statistically significant enhancement. These results suggest that there is little complementarity between the chemical information provided by these two sets of descriptors, despite their different sources and methods of calculation.

10.1515/cdbme-2022-1026,A Large-scale Virtual Patient Cohort to Study ECG Features of Interatrial Conduction Block,"Abstract Interatrial conduction block refers to a disturbance in the propagation of electrical impulses in the conduction pathways between the right and the left atrium. It is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, stroke, and premature death. Clinical diagnostic criteria comprise an increased P wave duration and biphasic P waves in lead II, III and aVF due to retrograde activation of the left atrium. Machine learning algorithms could improve the diagnosis but require a large-scale, well-controlled and balanced dataset. In silico electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, optimally obtained from a statistical shape model to cover anatomical variability, carry the potential to produce an extensive database meeting the requirements for successful machine learning application. We generated the first in silico dataset including interatrial conduction block of 9,800 simulated ECG signals based on a bi-atrial statistical shape model. Automated feature analysis was performed to evaluate P wave morphology, duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1. Increased P wave duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1 were found for models with interatrial conduction block compared to healthy models. A wide variability of P wave morphology was detected for models with interatrial conduction block. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results suggest that a biphasic P wave morphology seems to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of interatrial conduction block.

10.1101/2022.02.13.22270835,AugmentA: Patient-specific Augmented Atrial model Generation Tool,"Digital twins of patients' hearts are a promising tool to assess arrhythmia vulnerability and to personalize therapy. However, the process of building personalized computational models can be challenging and requires a high level of human interaction. A pipeline to standardize the generation of a patient's atrial digital twin from clinical data is therefore desirable. We propose a patient-specific Augmented Atria generation pipeline (AugmentA) as a highly automated framework which, starting from clinical geometrical data, provides ready-to-use atrial personalized computational models. AugmentA consists firstly of a pre-processing step applied to the input geometry. Secondly, the atrial orifices are identified and labelled using only one reference point per atrium. If the user chooses to fit a statistical shape model (SSM) to the input geometry, it is first rigidly aligned with the given mean shape before a non-rigid fitting procedure is applied. AugmentA automatically generates the fiber orientation and finds local conduction velocities by minimizing the error between the simulated and clinical local activation time (LAT) map. The pipeline was tested on a cohort of 29 patients on both segmented magnetic resonance images (MRI) and electroanatomical maps of the left atrium. Moreover, the pipeline was applied to a bi-atrial volumetric mesh derived from MRI. The pipeline robustly integrated fiber orientation and anatomical region annotations in 38.4+-5.7 s. The error between in-silico and clinical LAT maps was on average 12.7 ms. In conclusion, AugmentA offers an automated and comprehensive pipeline delivering atrial digital twins from clinical data in procedural time.",2022.0,2022-02-15 00:00:00,27,59,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63f36f814fffbb5582b67bfc6a54ec747952a4cf
10.1093/europace/euab322,Hybrid machine learning to localize atrial flutter substrates using the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram,"Abstract Aims Atrial flutter (AFlut) is a common re-entrant atrial tachycardia driven by self-sustainable mechanisms that cause excitations to propagate along pathways different from sinus rhythm. Intra-cardiac electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation are often performed without detailed prior knowledge of the mechanism perpetuating AFlut, likely prolonging the procedure time of these invasive interventions. We sought to discriminate the AFlut location [cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent (CTI), peri-mitral, and other left atrium (LA) AFlut classes] with a machine learning-based algorithm using only the non-invasive signals from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Methods and results Hybrid 12-lead ECG dataset of 1769 signals was used (1424 in silico ECGs, and 345 clinical ECGs from 115 patients—three different ECG segments over time were extracted from each patient corresponding to single AFlut cycles). Seventy-seven features were extracted. A decision tree classifier with a hold-out classification approach was trained, validated, and tested on the dataset randomly split after selecting the most informative features. The clinical test set comprised 38 patients (114 clinical ECGs). The classifier yielded 76.3% accuracy on the clinical test set with a sensitivity of 89.7%, 75.0%, and 64.1% and a positive predictive value of 71.4%, 75.0%, and 86.2% for CTI, peri-mitral, and other LA class, respectively. Considering majority vote of the three segments taken from each patient, the CTI class was correctly classified at 92%. Conclusion Our results show that a machine learning classifier relying only on non-invasive signals can potentially identify the location of AFlut mechanisms.

Although a 3D patient-specific model (PSM) can be obtained from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the fiber orientation of cardiac muscle, which significantly affects the electrophysiological and mechanical characteristics of the heart, can hardly be obtained in vivo. Several approaches have been suggested to solve this problem. However, most of them require a considerable amount of human interaction, which is both time-consuming and a potential source of error.

Methods We retrospectively collected electronic medical records of enrolled patients from the data warehouse of China Medical University Hospital, a tertiary medical center in central Taiwan, from January 2012 to November 2018. We included patients who underwent a documented carotid ultrasound within 30 days of experiencing an acute first stroke during the study period. We classified these participants into two groups: those with non-recurrent stroke (those who has not been diagnosed with acute stroke again during the study period) and those with recurrent stoke (those who has been diagnosed with acute stroke during the study period). A total of 1,235 carotid sonographic parameters were analyzed. Data on the patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities were also collected. Python 3.7 was used as the programming language, and the scikit-learn toolkit was used to complete the derivation and verification of the machine learning methods. Results In total, 2,411 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 1,896 and 515 had non-recurrent and recurrent stroke, respectively. After extraction, 43 features of carotid sonography (36 carotid sonographic parameters and seven transcranial color Doppler sonographic parameter) were analyzed. For predicting recurrent stroke, CatBoost achieved the highest area under the curve (0.844, CIs 95% 0.824–0.868), followed by the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (0.832, CIs 95% 0.813–0.851), random forest (0.819, CIs 95% 0.802–0.846), support-vector machine (0.759, CIs 95% 0.739–0.781), logistic regression (0.781, CIs 95% 0.764–0.800), and decision tree (0.735, CIs 95% 0.717–0.755) models. Conclusion When using the CatBoost model, the top three features for predicting recurrent stroke were determined to be the use of anticoagulation medications, the use of NSAID medications, and the resistive index of the left subclavian artery.

We wished to validate this effect and explore potential mechanisms of action. Methods In a multicentre inception cohort of eRA patients (n=191), we examined the whole blood IGS (MxA, IFI44L, OAS1, IFI6, ISG15) with reference to circulating IFN proteins, clinical outcomes and epigenetic influences on circulating CD19+ B and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Results We reproduced our previous findings demonstrating a raised baseline IGS. We additionally showed, for the first time, that the IGS in eRA reflects circulating IFN-α protein. Paired longitudinal analysis demonstrated a significant reduction between baseline and 6-month IGS and IFN-α levels (p<0.0001 for both). Despite this fall, a raised baseline IGS predicted worse 6-month clinical outcomes such as increased disease activity score (DAS-28, p=0.025) and lower likelihood of a good EULAR clinical response (p=0.034), which was independent of other conventional predictors of disease activity and clinical response. Molecular analysis of CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells demonstrated differentially methylated CPG sites and dysregulated expression of disease relevant genes, including PARP9, STAT1, and EPSTI1, associated with baseline IGS/IFNα levels. Differentially methylated CPG sites implicated altered transcription factor binding in B cells (GATA3, ETSI, NFATC2, EZH2) and T cells (p300, HIF1α). Conclusions Our data suggest that, in eRA, IFN-α can cause a sustained, epigenetically mediated, pathogenic increase in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and that the IGS is, therefore, a robust prognostic biomarker. Its persistent harmful effects provide a rationale for the initial therapeutic targeting of IFN-α in selected patients with eRA.",2022.0,2022-06-09 00:00:00,27,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3bc9b4799545d7211d53539705206db2d7b2672

Monocytes (MOs) and macrophages, largely associated with arthritis, are contributors and sensors of inflammation through epigenetic modifications. In this study, we investigated associations between clinical features and DNA methylation in blood and synovial fluid (SF) MOs in a prospective cohort of patients with early inflammatory arthritis. DNA methylation profiles of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) blood MOs exhibited marked alterations in comparison with those from healthy donors. We identified additional differences both in blood and SF MOs after comparing patients with UA grouped by their future outcomes, i.e., good versus poor. Patient profiles in subsequent visits revealed a reversion toward a healthy level in both groups, those requiring disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and those who remitted spontaneously. Changes in disease activity between visits also affected DNA methylation, which was partially concomitant in the SF of UA and in blood MOs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Epigenetic similarities between arthritis types allow a common prediction of disease activity. Our results constitute a resource of DNA methylation–based biomarkers of poor prognosis, disease activity, and treatment efficacy for the personalized clinical management of early inflammatory arthritis.",2022.0,2022-03-24 00:00:00,12,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/639926891e3f96e6adce443d5a4944cdd09ae22f

This potential is encapsulated by the concept of a quantum advantage, which is contingent on a reduction in the consumption of a computational resource, such as time, space or data. Here, we distill the concept of a quantum advantage into a simple framework to aid researchers in biology and medicine pursuing the development of quantum applications. We then apply this framework to a wide variety of computational problems relevant to these domains in an effort to (i) assess the potential of practical advantages in specific application areas and (ii) identify gaps that may be addressed with novel quantum approaches. In doing so, we provide an extensive survey of the intersection of biology and medicine with the current landscape of quantum algorithms and their potential advantages. While we endeavour to identify specific computational problems that may admit practical advantages throughout this work, the rapid pace of change in the fields of quantum computing, classical algorithms and biological research implies that this intersection will remain highly dynamic for the foreseeable future.",2021.0,2021-12-01 00:00:00,48,466,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/718924aaa37a9af821f521930e1055c0290d74ef

10.3390/s23031315,Development of a Machine-Learning Intrusion Detection System and Testing of Its Performance Using a Generative Adversarial Network,"Intrusion detection and prevention are two of the most important issues to solve in network security infrastructure. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) protect networks by using patterns to detect malicious traffic. As attackers have tried to dissimulate traffic in order to evade the rules applied, several machine learning-based IDSs have been developed. In this study, we focused on one such model involving several algorithms and used the NSL-KDD dataset as a benchmark to train and evaluate its performance. We demonstrate a way to create adversarial instances of network traffic that can be used to evade detection by a machine learning-based IDS. Moreover, this traffic can be used for training in order to improve performance in the case of new attacks. Thus, a generative adversarial network (GAN)—i.e., an architecture based on a deep-learning algorithm capable of creating generative models—was implemented. Furthermore, we tested the IDS performance using the generated adversarial traffic. The results showed that, even in the case of the GAN-generated traffic (which could successfully evade IDS detection), by using the adversarial traffic in the testing process, we could improve the machine learning-based IDS performance.",2023.0,2023-01-24 00:00:00,13,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12856e9925f5b18c710e401e452aa39ca43f7d68

The MCTS algorithm enables the generation model to provide a reward value that reflects the probability of generative examples bypassing the detector. To guarantee the antagonism and feasibility of the generative adversarial examples, the bypassing rules are restricted. The experimental results indicate that the missed detection rate of adversarial examples is significantly improved after the MCTS-T generation algorithm. Additionally, we construct a generative adversarial network (GAN) to optimize the detector and improve the detection rate when dealing with adversarial examples.

10.3389/ffutr.2021.688482,Automotive Intelligence Embedded in Electric Connected Autonomous and Shared Vehicles Technology for Sustainable Green Mobility,"The automotive sector digitalization accelerates the technology convergence of perception, computing processing, connectivity, propulsion, and data fusion for electric connected autonomous and shared (ECAS) vehicles. This brings cutting-edge computing paradigms with embedded cognitive capabilities into vehicle domains and data infrastructure to provide holistic intrinsic and extrinsic intelligence for new mobility applications. Digital technologies are a significant enabler in achieving the sustainability goals of the green transformation of the mobility and transportation sectors. Innovation occurs predominantly in ECAS vehicles’ architecture, operations, intelligent functions, and automotive digital infrastructure. The traditional ownership model is moving toward multimodal and shared mobility services. The ECAS vehicle’s technology allows for the development of virtual automotive functions that run on shared hardware platforms with data unlocking value, and for introducing new, shared computing-based automotive features. Facilitating vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is accomplished by the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), cellular/wireless connectivity, edge computing, the Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of intelligent things (IoIT), digital twins (DTs), virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Vehicles become more intelligent, connected, functioning as edge micro servers on wheels, powered by sensors/actuators, hardware (HW), software (SW) and smart virtual functions that are integrated into the digital infrastructure. Electrification, automation, connectivity, digitalization, decarbonization, decentralization, and standardization are the main drivers that unlock intelligent vehicles' potential for sustainable green mobility applications. ECAS vehicles act as autonomous agents using swarm intelligence to communicate and exchange information, either directly or indirectly, with each other and the infrastructure, accessing independent services such as energy, high-definition maps, routes, infrastructure information, traffic lights, tolls, parking (micropayments), and finding emergent/intelligent solutions. The article gives an overview of the advances in AI technologies and applications to realize intelligent functions and optimize vehicle performance, control, and decision-making for future ECAS vehicles to support the acceleration of deployment in various mobility scenarios. ECAS vehicles, systems, sub-systems, and components are subjected to stringent regulatory frameworks, which set rigorous requirements for autonomous vehicles. An in-depth assessment of existing standards, regulations, and laws, including a thorough gap analysis, is required. Global guidelines must be provided on how to fulfill the requirements. ECAS vehicle technology trustworthiness, including AI-based HW/SW and algorithms, is necessary for developing ECAS systems across the entire automotive ecosystem. The safety and transparency of AI-based technology and the explainability of the purpose, use, benefits, and limitations of AI systems are critical for fulfilling trustworthiness requirements. The article presents ECAS vehicles’ evolution toward domain controller, zonal vehicle, and federated vehicle/edge/cloud-centric based on distributed intelligence in the vehicle and infrastructure level architectures and the role of AI techniques and methods to implement the different autonomous driving and optimization functions for sustainable green mobility.",2021.0,2021-08-26 00:00:00,38,121,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91e81b3bd18626b0d6800d365129389e8aced7e4

The goal of this research work is to develop a system that can effectively detect fall/collapse and classify other discrete daily living activities such as sitting, standing, walking, drinking, and bending. For this paper, a publicly accessible dataset is employed, which is captured at various geographical locations using a 5.8 GHz Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) RADAR. A total of ninety-nine participants, including young and elderly individuals, took part in the experimental campaign. During data acquisition, each aforementioned activity was recorded for 5–10 s. Through the obtained data, we generated the micro-doppler signatures using short-time Fourier transform by exploiting MATLAB tools. Subsequently, the micro-doppler signatures are validated, trained, and tested using a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm called Residual Neural Network or ResNet. The ResNet classifier is developed in Python, which is utilised to classify six distinct human activities in this study. Furthermore, the metrics used to analyse the trained model’s performance are precision, recall, F1-score, classification accuracy, and confusion matrix. To test the resilience of the proposed method, two separate experiments are carried out. The trained ResNet models are put to the test by subject-independent scenarios and unseen data of the above-mentioned human activities at diverse geographical spaces.

10.3390/s21113881,Radar Sensing for Activity Classification in Elderly People Exploiting Micro-Doppler Signatures Using Machine Learning,"The health status of an elderly person can be identified by examining the additive effects of aging along with disease linked to it and can lead to ‘unstable incapacity’. This health status is determined by the apparent decline of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs). Detecting ADLs provides possibilities of improving the home life of elderly people as it can be applied to fall detection systems. This paper presents fall detection in elderly people based on radar image classification by examining their daily routine activities, using radar data that were previously collected for 99 volunteers. Machine learning techniques are used classify six human activities, namely walking, sitting, standing, picking up objects, drinking water and fall events. Different machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, long short-term memory, bi-directional long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks, were used for data classification. To obtain optimum results, we applied data processing techniques, such as principal component analysis and data augmentation, to the available radar images. The aim of this paper is to improve upon the results achieved using a publicly available dataset to further improve upon research of fall detection systems. It was found out that the best results were obtained using the CNN algorithm with principal component analysis and data augmentation together to obtain a result of 95.30% accuracy. The results also demonstrated that principal component analysis was most beneficial when the training data were expanded by augmentation of the available data.

10.1109/JSEN.2020.3006386,Continuous Human Activity Classification From FMCW Radar With Bi-LSTM Networks,"Recognition of human movements with radar for ambient activity monitoring is a developed area of research that yet presents outstanding challenges to address. In real environments, activities and movements are performed with seamless motion, with continuous transitions between activities of different duration and a large range of dynamic motions, compared with discrete activities of fixed-time lengths which are typically analysed in the literature. This paper proposes a novel approach based on recurrent LSTM and Bi-LSTM network architectures for continuous activity monitoring and classification. This approach uses radar data in the form of a continuous temporal sequence of micro-Doppler or range-time information, differently from from other conventional approaches based on convolutional networks that interpret the radar data as images. Experimental radar data involving 15 participants and different sequences of 6 actions are used to validate the proposed approach.

10.3390/s20205948,IR-UWB Sensor Based Fall Detection Method Using CNN Algorithm,"Falls are the leading cause of fatal injuries in the elderly such as fractures, and secondary damage from falls can lead to death. As such, fall detection is a crucial topic. However, due to the trade-off relationship between privacy preservation, user convenience, and fall detection performance, it is generally difficult to develop a fall detection system that simultaneously satisfies all conditions. The main goal of this study is to build a practical fall detection framework that can effectively classify the various behavior types into “Fall” and “Activities of daily living (ADL)” while securing privacy preservation and user convenience. For this purpose, signal data containing the motion information of objects was collected using a non-contact, unobtrusive, and non-restraint impulse-radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) radar. These data were then applied to a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to create an object behavior type classifier that can classify the behavior types of objects into “Fall” and “ADL.” The data were collected by actually performing various activities of daily living, including falling. The performance of the classifier yielded satisfactory results. By combining an IR-UWB and CNN algorithm, this study demonstrates the feasibility of building a practical fall detection system that exceeds a certain level of detection accuracy while also ensuring privacy preservation and user convenience.",2020.0,2020-10-01 00:00:00,31,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a9a0b22f131c996dc9cf1e24046d79a8f9d9ba

-parity violating supersymmetry searches at the LHC","Supersymmetry with hadronic R-parity violation in which the lightest neutralino decays into three quarks is still weakly constrained. This work aims to further improve the current search for this scenario by the boosted decision tree method with additional information from jet substructure. In particular, we find a deep neural network turns out to perform well in characterizing the neutralino jet substructure. We first construct a convolutional neutral network (CNN) which is capable of tagging the neutralino jet in any signal process by using the idea of jet image. When applied to pure jet samples, such a CNN outperforms the N-subjettiness variable by a factor of a few in tagging efficiency. Moreover, we find the method, which combines the CNN output and jet invariant mass, can perform better and is applicable to a wider range of neutralino mass than the CNN alone. Finally, the ATLAS search for the signal of gluino pair production with subsequent decay g˜→qqχ˜10(→qqq) is recast as an application. In contrast to the pure sample, the heavy contamination among jets in this complex final state renders the discriminating powers of the CNN and N subjettiness similar. By analyzing the jets substructure in events which pass the ATLAS cuts with our CNN method, the exclusion limit on gluino mass can be pushed up by ∼200  GeV for neutralino mass ∼100  GeV.",2018.0,2018-05-27 00:00:00,19,63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da88d9a10a39305902356c0be707bd963b293df2

This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent research into novel methods for cyber threat detection, encompassing diverse approaches such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, behavioral analysis and anomaly detection. Machine learning plays a central role in cyber threat detection, highlighting the effectiveness of deep neural networks in identifying evolving threats. Their adaptability to changing attack patterns is emphasized, underlining their importance for real-time security monitoring. In parallel, ensemble learning is explored, combining multiple models to improve overall detection accuracy and create a robust defense against a spectrum of cyber threats. The literature reviewed highlights the importance of behavioral analysis, with a novel approach that integrates user behaviour profiling with anomaly detection. This has proven effective in identifying suspicious activity within a network, particularly insider threats and stealthy attacks. Another behavioral framework using User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is presented for enhanced anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of context-aware monitoring in improving threat detection accuracy. Collaborative defense mechanisms emerge as a major focus of the research papers reviewed, exploring the potential of sharing threat information between organisations to enhance collective security monitoring. Their findings underscore the importance of a collaborative approach to staying ahead of rapidly evolving cyber threats. Some types of cyber-attacks are also analysed in the context of a security operations centre (SOC) monitoring environment using a security information and event management (SIEM) tool - Splunk. In conclusion, this survey paper synthesizes recent advances in cyber threat detection methods in security monitoring that integrate machine learning, behavioral analysis, and collaborative defense strategies.

The majority of current research relies on feature-ready datasets that heavily depend on feature engineering. Conversely, the increasing complexity of network traffic and the ongoing evolution of attack techniques lead to a diminishing distinction between benign and malicious network behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end intrusion detection framework based on a contrastive learning approach. We design a hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to facilitate the automated extraction of spatiotemporal features from raw traffic data. The integration of contrastive learning amplifies the distinction between benign and malicious network traffic in the representation space. The proposed method exhibits enhanced detection capabilities for unknown attacks in comparison to the approaches trained using the cross-entropy loss function. Experiments are carried out on the public datasets CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, demonstrating that our method can attain a detection accuracy of 99.9% for known attacks, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance.

XAI has emerged as a pivotal focus in achieving a zero-trust cybersecurity strategy within marine communication networks. This article presents the development of a zero-trust NIDS framework designed to detect contemporary marine cyberattacks, utilizing two modern datasets (2023 Edge-IIoTset and 2023 CICIoT). The zero-trust NIDS model achieves an optimal Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of 97.33% and an F1-score of 99% in a multi-class experiment. The XAI approach leverages visual and quantitative XAI methods, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithms, to enhance explainability and interpretability.

10.3390/app132413310,Evaluating Ensemble Learning Mechanisms for Predicting Advanced Cyber Attacks,"With the increased sophistication of cyber-attacks, there is a greater demand for effective network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to protect against various threats. Traditional NIDS are incapable of detecting modern and sophisticated attacks due to the fact that they rely on pattern-matching models or simple activity analysis. Moreover, Intelligent NIDS based on Machine Learning (ML) models are still in the early stages and often exhibit low accuracy and high false positives, making them ineffective in detecting emerging cyber-attacks. On the other hand, improved detection and prediction frameworks provided by ensemble algorithms have demonstrated impressive outcomes in specific applications. In this research, we investigate the potential of ensemble models in the enhancement of NIDS functionalities in order to provide a reliable and intelligent security defense. We present a NIDS hybrid model that uses ensemble ML techniques to identify and prevent various intrusions more successfully than stand-alone approaches. A combination of several distinct machine learning methods is integrated into a hybrid framework. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is pre-processed, and its features are engineered prior to being used to train and evaluate the proposed model structure. The performance evaluation of the ensemble of various ML classifiers demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms individual model approaches. Using all the employed experimental combination forms, the designed model significantly enhances the detection accuracy attaining more than 99%, while false positives are reduced to less than 1%.",2023.0,2023-12-16 00:00:00,4,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fbf387974cef504a7ecb37c6ac10046346db4a2

10.3389/fbinf.2022.866902,Cronos: A Machine Learning Pipeline for Description and Predictive Modeling of Microbial Communities Over Time,"Microbial time-series analysis, typically, examines the abundances of individual taxa over time and attempts to assign etiology to observed patterns. This approach assumes homogeneous groups in terms of profiles and response to external effectors. These assumptions are not always fulfilled, especially in complex natural systems, like the microbiome of the human gut. It is actually established that humans with otherwise the same demographic or dietary backgrounds can have distinct microbial profiles. We suggest an alternative approach to the analysis of microbial time-series, based on the following premises: 1) microbial communities are organized in distinct clusters of similar composition at any time point, 2) these intrinsic subsets of communities could have different responses to the same external effects, and 3) the fate of the communities is largely deterministic given the same external conditions. Therefore, tracking the transition of communities, rather than individual taxa, across these states, can enhance our understanding of the ecological processes and allow the prediction of future states, by incorporating applied effects. We implement these ideas into Cronos, an analytical pipeline written in R. Cronos’ inputs are a microbial composition table (e.g., OTU table), their phylogenetic relations as a tree, and the associated metadata. Cronos detects the intrinsic microbial profile clusters on all time points, describes them in terms of composition, and records the transitions between them. Cluster assignments, combined with the provided metadata, are used to model the transitions and predict samples’ fate under various effects. We applied Cronos to available data from growing infants’ gut microbiomes, and we observe two distinct trajectories corresponding to breastfed and formula-fed infants that eventually converge to profiles resembling those of mature individuals.

10.1002/wics.1575,Stability estimation for unsupervised clustering: A review,"Cluster analysis remains one of the most challenging yet fundamental tasks in unsupervised learning. This is due in part to the fact that there are no labels or gold standards by which performance can be measured. Moreover, the wide range of clustering methods available is governed by different objective functions, different parameters, and dissimilarity measures. The purpose of clustering is versatile, often playing critical roles in the early stages of exploratory data analysis and as an endpoint for knowledge and discovery. Thus, understanding the quality of a clustering is of critical importance. The concept of stability has emerged as a strategy for assessing the performance and reproducibility of data clustering. The key idea is to produce perturbed data sets that are very close to the original, and cluster them. If the clustering is stable, then the clusters from the original data will be preserved in the perturbed data clustering. The nature of the perturbation, and the methods for quantifying similarity between clusterings, are nontrivial, and ultimately what distinguishes many of the stability estimation methods apart. In this review, we provide an overview of the very active research area of cluster stability estimation and discuss some of the open questions and challenges that remain in the field.",2022.0,2022-01-09 00:00:00,29,99,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07e1871d453de64cf3d70c3db47b48243e28ba4b

10.3390/s17071513,Analysis of Public Datasets for Wearable Fall Detection Systems,"Due to the boom of wireless handheld devices such as smartwatches and smartphones, wearable Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) have become a major focus of attention among the research community during the last years. The effectiveness of a wearable FDS must be contrasted against a wide variety of measurements obtained from inertial sensors during the occurrence of falls and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). In this regard, the access to public databases constitutes the basis for an open and systematic assessment of fall detection techniques. This paper reviews and appraises twelve existing available data repositories containing measurements of ADLs and emulated falls envisaged for the evaluation of fall detection algorithms in wearable FDSs. The analysis of the found datasets is performed in a comprehensive way, taking into account the multiple factors involved in the definition of the testbeds deployed for the generation of the mobility samples. The study of the traces brings to light the lack of a common experimental benchmarking procedure and, consequently, the large heterogeneity of the datasets from a number of perspectives (length and number of samples, typology of the emulated falls and ADLs, characteristics of the test subjects, features and positions of the sensors, etc.). Concerning this, the statistical analysis of the samples reveals the impact of the sensor range on the reliability of the traces. In addition, the study evidences the importance of the selection of the ADLs and the need of categorizing the ADLs depending on the intensity of the movements in order to evaluate the capability of a certain detection algorithm to discriminate falls from ADLs.",2017.0,2017-06-27 00:00:00,116,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13d425987501e4ce59db5cddda299df525c5c234

However, sepsis-associated ICU-acquired infections have not been fully characterized. The study aims to assess the risk factors and develop a model that predicts the risk of ICU-acquired infections in patients with sepsis. Methods We retrieved data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors that could predict ICU-acquired infection. We also assessed its discrimination and calibration abilities and compared them with classical score systems. Results Of 16,808 included septic patients, 2,871 (17.1%) developed ICU-acquired infection. These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725–0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 95% CI, 0.734–0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models. Conclusions ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic mortality.

10.1145/3540250.3549103,Adaptive fairness improvement based on causality analysis,"Given a discriminating neural network, the problem of fairness improvement is to systematically reduce discrimination without significantly scarifies its performance (i.e., accuracy). Multiple categories of fairness improving methods have been proposed for neural networks, including pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing. Our empirical study however shows that these methods are not always effective (e.g., they may improve fairness by paying the price of huge accuracy drop) or even not helpful (e.g., they may even worsen both fairness and accuracy). In this work, we propose an approach which adaptively chooses the fairness improving method based on causality analysis. That is, we choose the method based on how the neurons and attributes responsible for unfairness are distributed among the input attributes and the hidden neurons. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is effective (i.e., always identify the best fairness improving method) and efficient (i.e., with an average time overhead of 5 minutes).",2022.0,2022-09-15 00:00:00,29,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8f4bfaca3ebf42128226182d6f303ae22d244bb
10.1145/3510003.3510080,Causality-Based Neural Network Repair,"Neural networks have had discernible achievements in a wide range of applications. The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern of their dependability and reliability. Similar to traditional decision-making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to be repaired. The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security concerns or unjust societal impacts. In this work, we address the problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to construct a neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting the given neural network's parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically, we propose CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a causality-based neural network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault localization to identify the ‘guilty’ neurons and 2) optimizes the parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior. We have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE successfully improves fairness by 61.91 % on average. For backdoor removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over 98% to less than 1 %. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation rate to less than 1 %. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based fault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of the neural networks.",2022.0,2022-04-20 00:00:00,73,70,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cb0bd9f5927403bf29c3b9ccd25a79daac55194

Using encryption approaches and algorithms is one of the best ways to secure more sensitive data from cyber-attacks. In order to effectively defend against cybersecurity assaults, this research study attempts to give an analysis of the function that encryption methods and approaches serve.

10.3390/su14127375,Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Malicious Domains Detection Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),"With the expansion of the internet, a major threat has emerged involving the spread of malicious domains intended by attackers to perform illegal activities aiming to target governments, violating privacy of organizations, and even manipulating everyday users. Therefore, detecting these harmful domains is necessary to combat the growing network attacks. Machine Learning (ML) models have shown significant outcomes towards the detection of malicious domains. However, the “black box” nature of the complex ML models obstructs their wide-ranging acceptance in some of the fields. The emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has successfully incorporated the interpretability and explicability in the complex models. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI model has enabled the interpretability without affecting the performance of the models. This study aimed to propose an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model to detect malicious domains on a recent dataset containing 45,000 samples of malicious and non-malicious domains. In the current study, initially several interpretable ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB), and black box ensemble models, such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), AdaBoost (AB), and Cat Boost (CB) algorithms, were implemented and found that XGB outperformed the other classifiers. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI global surrogate model (Shapley additive explanations) and local surrogate LIME were used to generate the explanation of the XGB prediction. Two sets of experiments were performed; initially the model was executed using a preprocessed dataset and later with selected features using the Sequential Forward Feature selection algorithm. The results demonstrate that ML algorithms were able to distinguish benign and malicious domains with overall accuracy ranging from 0.8479 to 0.9856. The ensemble classifier XGB achieved the highest result, with an AUC and accuracy of 0.9991 and 0.9856, respectively, before the feature selection algorithm, while there was an AUC of 0.999 and accuracy of 0.9818 after the feature selection algorithm. The proposed model outperformed the benchmark study.",2022.0,2022-06-16 00:00:00,37,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0dd67335d80194e7ccf6c0ed275622bf60e5edce
10.3390/fi13120309,DNS Firewall Based on Machine Learning,"Nowadays there are many DNS firewall solutions to prevent users accessing malicious domains. These can provide real-time protection and block illegitimate communications, contributing to the cybersecurity posture of the organizations. Most of these solutions are based on known malicious domain lists that are being constantly updated. However, in this way, it is only possible to block malicious communications for known malicious domains, leaving out many others that are malicious but have not yet been updated in the blocklists. This work provides a study to implement a DNS firewall solution based on ML and so improve the detection of malicious domain requests on the fly. For this purpose, a dataset with 34 features and 90 k records was created based on real DNS logs. The data were enriched using OSINT sources. Exploratory analysis and data preparation steps were carried out, and the final dataset submitted to different Supervised ML algorithms to accurately and quickly classify if a domain request is malicious or not. The results show that the ML algorithms were able to classify the benign and malicious domains with accuracy rates between 89% and 96%, and with a classification time between 0.01 and 3.37 s. The contributions of this study are twofold. In terms of research, a dataset was made public and the methodology can be used by other researchers. In terms of solution, the work provides the baseline to implement an in band DNS firewall.",2021.0,2021-11-30 00:00:00,11,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8bdb4900b207c7b1f5cfd5dd4752997f9765e738

Currently, NMTF learns a representation of a dataset through an optimization procedure that typically uses multiplicative update rules. This procedure has had limited success, and its failure cases have not been well understood. We here perform an empirical study involving six large datasets comparing multiplicative update rules with three alternative optimization methods, including alternating least squares, projected gradients, and coordinate descent. We find that methods based on projected gradients and coordinate descent converge up to twenty-four times faster than multiplicative update rules. Furthermore, alternating least squares method can quickly train NMTF models on sparse datasets but often fails on dense datasets. Coordinate descent-based NMTF converges up to sixteen times faster compared to well-established methods.",2019.0,2019-06-11 00:00:00,20,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a77a52af69292650363829e81e55ef31a7bcce5

The objective of this mixed research is to analyze the impact of the flipped classroom in the teaching-learning process on statistics considering data science and machine learning (linear regression). The sample consists of 61 students who took the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course during the 2018 school year. This research proposes the consultation of the YouTube videos before the class, performance of the collaborative exercises and use of the spreadsheet to check the results during the class and performance of the laboratory practices through the spreadsheet after the class. The results of machine learning (70%, 80% and 90% of training) indicate that the participation of the students before, during and after the class positively influences the assimilation of knowledge and development of mathematical skills about the frequencies and measures of central tendency. On the other hand, the decision tree technique identifies 6 predictive models on the use of the flipped classroom. Also, the students of the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course are motivated and satisfied to use the technological tools in the Introduction to statistics Unit.

Machine learning based techniques, in particular deep neural networks, can provide a viable alternative to maximum-likelihood methods. However, most common neural network architectures were developed for other domains such as image recogntion. While these methods can enhance the reconstruction performance in IceCube, there is much potential for tailored techniques. In the typical physics use-case, many symmetries, invariances and prior knowledge exist in the data, which are not fully exploited by current network architectures. Novel and specialized deep learning based reconstruction techniques are desired which can leverage the physics potential of experiments like IceCube.
A reconstruction method using convolutional neural networks is presented which can significantly increase the reconstruction accuracy while greatly reducing the runtime in comparison to standard reconstruction methods in Ice- Cube.

Similar to the 2015 task, the goal of the shared task is to identify individual discourse relations that are present in natural language text. Given a natural language text, participating teams are asked to locate the discourse connectives (explicit or implicit) and their arguments as well as predicting the sense of the discourse connectives. Based on the success of the previous year, we continued to ask participants to deploy their systems on TIRA, a web-based platform on which participants can run their systems on the test data for evaluation. This evaluation methodology preserves the integrity of the shared task. We have also made a few changes and additions in the 2016 shared task based on the feedback from 2015. The first is that teams could choose to carry out the task on Chinese texts, or English texts, or both. We have also allowed participants to focus on parts of the shared task (rather than the whole thing) as a typical system requires substantial investment of effort. Finally, we have modified the scorer so that it can report results based on partial matches of the arguments. 23 teams participated in this year’s shared task, using a wide variety of approaches. In this overview paper, we present the task definition, the training and test sets, and the evaluation protocol and metric used during this shared task.

10.18653/v1/D15-1264,Closing the Gap: Domain Adaptation from Explicit to Implicit Discourse Relations,"Many discourse relations are explicitly marked with discourse connectives, and these examples could potentially serve as a plentiful source of training data for recognizing implicit discourse relations. However, there are important linguistic differences between explicit and implicit discourse relations, which limit the accuracy of such an approach. We account for these differences by applying techniques from domain adaptation, treating implicitly and explicitly-marked discourse relations as separate domains. The distribution of surface features varies across these two domains, so we apply a marginalized denoising autoencoder to induce a dense, domain-general representation. The label distribution is also domain-specific, so we apply a resampling technique that is similar to instance weighting. In combination with a set of automatically-labeled data, these improvements eliminate more than 80% of the transfer loss incurred by training an implicit discourse relation classifier on explicitly-marked discourse relations.",2015.0,2015-09-01 00:00:00,29,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b8d7847251fa73e78e0cad9ef78e25490345539

10.1101/2020.02.03.932350,Machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures for rapid classification of novel pathogens: COVID-19 case study,"As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to 30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.",2020.0,2020-02-04 00:00:00,496,110,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4387d52b5c48f386a1fa3e11d529c3a89ee0717

10.7717/peerj.14311,Comparison of iCOR and Rayleigh atmospheric correction methods on Sentinel-3 OLCI images for a shallow eutrophic reservoir,"Remote sensing of inland waters is challenging, but also important, due to the need to monitor the ever-increasing harmful algal blooms (HABs), which have serious effects on water quality. The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) of the Sentinel-3 satellites program is capable of providing images for the monitoring of such waters. Atmospheric correction is a necessary process in order to retrieve the desired surface-leaving radiance signal and several atmospheric correction methods have been developed through the years. However, many of these correction methods require programming language skills, or function as commercial software plugins, limiting their possibility of use by end users. Accordingly, in this study, the free SNAP software provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to evaluate the possible differences between a partial atmospheric correction method accounting for Rayleigh scattering and a full atmospheric correction method (iCOR), applied on Sentinel-3 OLCI images of a shallow, highly eutrophic water reservoir. For the complete evaluation of the two methods, in addition to the comparison of the band reflectance values, chlorophyll (CHL) and cyanobacteria (CI) indices were also calculated and their values were intercompared. The results showed, that although the absolute values between the two correction methods did not coincide, there was a very good correlation between the two methods for both bands’ reflectance (r > 0.73) and the CHL and CI indices values (r > 0.95). Therefore, since iCOR correction image processing time is 25 times longer than Rayleigh correction, it is proposed that the Rayleigh partial correction method may be alternatively used for seasonal water monitoring, especially in cases of long time-series, enhancing time and resources use efficiency. Further comparisons of the two methods in other inland water bodies and evaluation with in situ chlorophyll and cyanobacteria measurements will enhance the applicability of the methodology.",2022.0,2022-11-04 00:00:00,4,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca24992933a93aad400eaffa4c4ee9e2297aa3a8
10.1071/mf21081,Climate change and cyanobacteria harmful algae blooms: adaptation practices for developing countries,"Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are increasingly being reported worldwide owing to several reasons, including widespread eutrophication and enhanced scientific monitoring. Catchment and water management, organisations, industry, farmers and local governments are all confronting the effects of climate change, which stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria and affect the efficacy of adaptation measures in water systems. To tackle climate change and CyanoHABs growth, actors at different levels require both ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ assessments to help them in formulating and implementing adaptation measures. Potential solutions must also be assessed locally to limit associated adverse effects, in particular, negative effects on water quality. Thus, having a better understanding of the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between adaptation practices and climate-change effects on CyanoHABs makes a valuable contribution to a more integrated climate policy and the effective climate-proofing of our water bodies. This article examines adaptation practices focused on tackling CyanoHABs occurrence in a changing climate. It fills an important gap between a major environmental problem and potential solutions. The practices and measures advanced as a result of the analysis can be used by persons with different expertise and skill levels for improving the relevant institutional frameworks and policies to protect their local water bodies.",2021.0,2021-08-26 00:00:00,8,111,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4cc2b4dac85c7523287e4c86eb6fb1ecf5abb4da

10.3390/life4040988,Mitigating Harmful Cyanobacterial Blooms in a Human- and Climatically-Impacted World,"Bloom-forming harmful cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs) are harmful from environmental, ecological and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, creating low oxygen conditions (hypoxia, anoxia), and by producing cyanotoxins. Cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence, global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. CyanoHABs are regulated by synergistic effects of nutrient (nitrogen:N and phosphorus:P) supplies, light, temperature, vertical stratification, water residence times, and biotic interactions. In most instances, nutrient control strategies should focus on reducing both N and P inputs. Strategies based on physical, chemical (nutrient) and biological manipulations can be effective in reducing CyanoHABs; however, these strategies are largely confined to relatively small systems, and some are prone to ecological and environmental drawbacks, including enhancing release of cyanotoxins, disruption of planktonic and benthic communities and fisheries habitat. All strategies should consider and be adaptive to climatic variability and change in order to be effective for long-term control of CyanoHABs. Rising temperatures and greater hydrologic variability will increase growth rates and alter critical nutrient thresholds for CyanoHAB development; thus, nutrient reductions for bloom control may need to be more aggressively pursued in response to climatic changes globally.",2014.0,2014-12-01 00:00:00,251,120,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2eb9d8b4755edee5d0db8fbb5720bca518d20de3

10.3390/e21020184,Bayesian Recurrent Neural Network Models for Forecasting and Quantifying Uncertainty in Spatial-Temporal Data,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are nonlinear dynamical models commonly used in the machine learning and dynamical systems literature to represent complex dynamical or sequential relationships between variables. Recently, as deep learning models have become more common, RNNs have been used to forecast increasingly complicated systems. Dynamical spatio-temporal processes represent a class of complex systems that can potentially benefit from these types of models. Although the RNN literature is expansive and highly developed, uncertainty quantification is often ignored. Even when considered, the uncertainty is generally quantified without the use of a rigorous framework, such as a fully Bayesian setting. Here we attempt to quantify uncertainty in a more formal framework while maintaining the forecast accuracy that makes these models appealing, by presenting a Bayesian RNN model for nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting. Additionally, we make simple modifications to the basic RNN to help accommodate the unique nature of nonlinear spatio-temporal data. The proposed model is applied to a Lorenz simulation and two real-world nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting applications.",2017.0,2017-11-02 00:00:00,96,70,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca625e2bfed10069873f5bbd314836fe05fa1eb7

10.3390/jcm11061740,The Role of Radiomics in the Era of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A New Protagonist in the Jungle of Response Criteria,"Simple Summary The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has represented a milestone in cancer treatment. Despite PD-L1 expression being the standard biomarker used before the start of therapy, there is still a strict need to identify complementary non-invasive biomarkers in order to better select patients. In this context, radiomics is an emerging approach for examining medical images and clinical data by capturing multiple features hidden from human eye and is potentially able to predict response assessment and survival in the course of immunotherapy. We reviewed the available studies investigating the role of radiomics in cancer patients, focusing on non-small cell lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although preliminary research shows encouraging results, different issues need to be solved before radiomics can enter into clinical practice. Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have demonstrated encouraging results in terms of durable clinical benefit and survival in several malignancies. Nevertheless, the search to identify an “ideal” biomarker for predicting response to ICI is still far from over. Radiomics is a new translational field of study aiming to extract, by dedicated software, several features from a given medical image, ranging from intensity distribution and spatial heterogeneity to higher-order statistical parameters. Based on these premises, our review aims to summarize the current status of radiomics as a potential predictor of clinical response following immunotherapy treatment. A comprehensive search of PubMed results was conducted. All studies published in English up to and including December 2021 were selected, comprising those that explored computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) for radiomic analyses in the setting of ICI. Several studies have demonstrated the potential applicability of radiomic features in the monitoring of the therapeutic response beyond the traditional morphologic and metabolic criteria, as well as in the prediction of survival or non-invasive assessment of the tumor microenvironment.

10.3389/fimmu.2021.773581,Radiomics Assessment of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment to Predict Outcomes in Breast Cancer,"Background The immune microenvironment of tumors provides information on prognosis and prediction. A prior validation of the immunoscore for breast cancer (ISBC) was made on the basis of a systematic assessment of immune landscapes extrapolated from a large number of neoplastic transcripts. Our goal was to develop a non-invasive radiomics-based ISBC predictive factor. Methods Immunocell fractions of 22 different categories were evaluated using CIBERSORT on the basis of a large, open breast cancer cohort derived from comprehensive information on gene expression. The ISBC was constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model derived from the Immunocell type scores, with 479 quantified features in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions as observed from DCE-MRI. A radiomics signature [radiomics ImmunoScore (RIS)] was developed for the prediction of ISBC using a random forest machine-learning algorithm, and we further evaluated its relationship with prognosis. Results An ISBC consisting of seven different immune cells was established through the use of a LASSO model. Multivariate analyses showed that the ISBC was an independent risk factor in prognosis (HR=2.42, with a 95% CI of 1.49–3.93; P<0.01). A radiomic signature of 21 features of the ISBC was then exploited and validated (the areas under the curve [AUC] were 0.899 and 0.815). We uncovered statistical associations between the RIS signature with recurrence-free and overall survival rates (both P<0.05). Conclusions The RIS is a valuable instrument with which to assess the immunoscore, and offers important implications for the prognosis of breast cancer.",2022.0,2022-01-03 00:00:00,29,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbb601d194933864c61fbea787ba526401a172f9

Flavonoids have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antiviral activities. Although most of the research or applications of flavonoids are focused on human diseases, flavonoids also show potential applicability against porcine virus infection. This review focuses on the recent progress in antiviral mechanisms of potential flavonoids against the most common porcine viruses. The mechanism discussed in this paper may provide a theoretical basis for drug screening and application of natural flavonoid compounds and flavonoid-containing herbs to control porcine virus infection and guide the research and development of pig feed additives.",2022.0,2022-08-26 00:00:00,11,131,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40dda5a0f267742ed28cd1b86d0b358e5b490a55
10.3390/ijms222413414,Identification of African Swine Fever Virus Inhibitors through High Performance Virtual Screening Using Machine Learning,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a highly contagious virus that causes severe hemorrhagic viral disease resulting in high mortality in domestic and wild pigs, until few antiviral agents can inhibit ASFV infections. Thus, new anti-ASFV drugs need to be urgently identified. Recently, we identified pentagastrin as a potential antiviral drug against ASFVs using molecular docking and machine learning models. However, the scoring functions are easily influenced by properties of protein pockets, resulting in a scoring bias. Here, we employed the 5′-P binding pocket of AsfvPolX as a potential binding site to identify antiviral drugs and classified 13 AsfvPolX structures into three classes based on pocket parameters calculated by the SiteMap module. We then applied principal component analysis to eliminate this scoring bias, which was effective in making the SP Glide score more balanced between 13 AsfvPolX structures in the dataset. As a result, we identified cangrelor and fostamatinib as potential antiviral drugs against ASFVs. Furthermore, the classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein can provide an alternative approach to identify novel antiviral drugs by optimizing the scoring function of the docking programs. Here, we report a machine learning-based novel approach to generate high binding affinity compounds that are individually matched to the available classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein.",2021.0,2021-12-01 00:00:00,6,34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e77c20cd0807b026fb60afd7725547425720857f
10.3390/v13112124,Structures and Functional Diversities of ASFV Proteins,"African swine fever virus (ASFV), the causative pathogen of the recent ASF epidemic, is a highly contagious double-stranded DNA virus. Its genome is in the range of 170~193 kbp and encodes 68 structural proteins and over 100 non-structural proteins. Its high pathogenicity strains cause nearly 100% mortality in swine. Consisting of four layers of protein shells and an inner genome, its structure is obviously more complicated than many other viruses, and its multi-layered structures play different kinds of roles in ASFV replication and survival. Each layer possesses many proteins, but very few of the proteins have been investigated at a structural level. Here, we concluded all the ASFV proteins whose structures were unveiled, and explained their functions from the view of structures. Those structures include ASFV AP endonuclease, dUTPases (E165R), pS273R protease, core shell proteins p15 and p35, non-structural proteins pA151R, pNP868R (RNA guanylyltransferase), major capsid protein p72 (gene B646L), Bcl-2-like protein A179L, histone-like protein pA104R, sulfhydryl oxidase pB119L, polymerase X and ligase. These novel structural features, diverse functions, and complex molecular mechanisms promote ASFV to escape the host immune system easily and make this large virus difficult to control.",2021.0,2021-10-21 00:00:00,65,60,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d688f78e4ad7d7a65c2e84fda02f40324d25b51d
10.3389/fmicb.2021.736780,Flavonoid Library Screening Reveals Kaempferol as a Potential Antiviral Agent Against African Swine Fever Virus,"Naturally occurring plant flavonoids are a promising class of antiviral agents to inhibit African swine fever virus (ASFV), which causes highly fatal disease in pigs and is a major threat to the swine industry. Currently known flavonoids with anti-ASFV activity demonstrate a wide range of antiviral mechanisms, which motivates exploration of new antiviral candidates within this class. The objective of this study was to determine whether other flavonoids may significantly inhibit ASFV infection in vitro. We performed a cell-based library screen of 90 flavonoids. Our screening method allowed us to track the development of virus-induced cytopathic effect by MTT in the presence of tested flavonoids. This screening method was shown to be robust for hit identification, with an average Z-factor of 0.683. We identified nine compounds that inhibit ASFV Ba71V strain in Vero cells. Among them, kaempferol was the most potent and exhibited dose-dependent inhibition, which occurred through a virostatic effect. Time-of-addition studies revealed that kaempferol acts on the entry and post-entry stages of the ASFV replication cycle and impairs viral protein and DNA synthesis. It was further identified that kaempferol induces autophagy in ASFV-infected Vero cells, which is related to its antiviral activity and could be partially abrogated by the addition of an autophagy inhibitor. Kaempferol also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of a highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate in porcine macrophages. Together, these findings support that kaempferol is a promising anti-ASFV agent and has a distinct antiviral mechanism compared to other anti-ASFV flavonoids.",2021.0,2021-10-21 00:00:00,30,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36caa5bf1e64ea55b4632b6bdd76ec3031cca7a6
10.3389/fimmu.2021.715582,Structure of African Swine Fever Virus and Associated Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Infection and Immunosuppression: A Review,"African swine fever (ASF) is an acute, highly contagious, and deadly infectious disease. The mortality rate of the most acute and acute ASF infection is almost 100%. The World Organization for Animal Health [Office International des épizooties (OIE)] lists it as a legally reported animal disease and China lists it as class I animal epidemic. Since the first diagnosed ASF case in China on August 3, 2018, it has caused huge economic losses to animal husbandry. ASF is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), which is the only member of Asfarviridae family. ASFV is and the only insect-borne DNA virus belonging to the Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) family with an icosahedral structure and an envelope. Till date, there are still no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs for the prevention or treatment of ASF. The complex viral genome and its sophisticated ability to regulate the host immune response may be the reason for the difficulty in developing an effective vaccine. This review summarizes the recent findings on ASFV structure, the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection and immunosuppression, and ASFV-encoded proteins to provide comprehensive proteomic information for basic research on ASFV. In addition, it also analyzes the results of previous studies and speculations on the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection, which aids the study of the mechanism of clinical pathological phenomena, and provides a possible direction for an intensive study of ASFV infection mechanism. By summarizing the findings on molecular mechanism of ASFV- regulated host cell immune response, this review provides orientations and ideas for fundamental research on ASFV and provides a theoretical basis for the development of protective vaccines against ASFV.",2021.0,2021-09-06 00:00:00,102,92,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8a3a0c5275b158456f72c750baa7ffdc7e0c900

In this work, we show how deep learning can be used to advance the research field of photochemistry by learning all important properties—multiple energies, forces, and different couplings—for photodynamics simulations. We simplify such simulations substantially by (i) a phase-free training skipping costly preprocessing of raw quantum chemistry data; (ii) rotationally covariant nonadiabatic couplings, which can either be trained or (iii) alternatively be approximated from only ML potentials, their gradients, and Hessians; and (iv) incorporating spin–orbit couplings. As the deep-learning method, we employ SchNet with its automatically determined representation of molecular structures and extend it for multiple electronic states. In combination with the molecular dynamics program SHARC, our approach termed SchNarc is tested on two polyatomic molecules and paves the way toward efficient photodynamics simulations of complex systems.",2020.0,2020-02-17 00:00:00,128,121,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b05342ee8cc6b45f88741b3000ca0671f063edb7

However, the pervasiveness of web browsing in our daily life does not come without security risks. This widespread practice of web browsing in combination with web users’ low situational awareness against cyber attacks, exposes them to a variety of threats, such as phishing, malware and profiling. Phishing attacks can compromise a target, individual or enterprise, through social interaction alone. Moreover, in the current threat landscape phishing attacks typically serve as an attack vector or initial step in a more complex campaign. To make matters worse, past work has demonstrated the inability of denylists, which are the default phishing countermeasure, to protect users from the dynamic nature of phishing URLs. In this context, our work uses supervised machine learning to block phishing attacks, based on a novel combination of features that are extracted solely from the URL. We evaluate our performance over time with a dataset which consists of active phishing attacks and compare it with Google Safe Browsing (GSB), i.e., the default security control in most popular web browsers. We find that our work outperforms GSB in all of our experiments, as well as performs well even against phishing URLs which are active one year after our model’s training.",2021.0,2021-06-13 00:00:00,39,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ecff4b51c63a7cf6fd1d6379a117292a3c1bfa5c

As a result, an enormous amount of personal information and financial transactions become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Phishing is an example of a highly effective form of cybercrime that enables criminals to deceive users and steal important data. Since the first reported phishing attack in 1990, it has been evolved into a more sophisticated attack vector. At present, phishing is considered one of the most frequent examples of fraud activity on the Internet. Phishing attacks can lead to severe losses for their victims including sensitive information, identity theft, companies, and government secrets. This article aims to evaluate these attacks by identifying the current state of phishing and reviewing existing phishing techniques. Studies have classified phishing attacks according to fundamental phishing mechanisms and countermeasures discarding the importance of the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing. This article proposes a new detailed anatomy of phishing which involves attack phases, attacker’s types, vulnerabilities, threats, targets, attack mediums, and attacking techniques. Moreover, the proposed anatomy will help readers understand the process lifecycle of a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of these phishing attacks and the techniques being used; also, it helps in developing a holistic anti-phishing system.

The financial sector is the primary target of phishing, and there are many different approaches to combat phishing attacks. Software-based detection approaches are more prominent in phishing detection; however, still, there is no robust solution that can stable for a long period. The primary purpose of this paper is to propose a novel solution to detect phishing attacks using a combined model of LSTM and CNN deep networks with the use of both URLs and HTML pages. The URLs are learned using an LSTM network with 1D convolutional, and another 1D convolutional network is used to learn the HTML features. These two networks were trained separately and combined through a sigmoid layer by dropping the last layer of each model to have the proposed model. The proposed model reached 98.34% in terms of accuracy, and that is above the previously recorded highest accuracy of 97.3% among the detection models used both URL and HTML features in the explored literature. The solution requires feature extraction only with HTML pages, and URLs were directly fed with a minimum pre-processing. Although the proposed solution uses extracted HTML features, those do not depend on third-party services. Therefore, an efficient real-time application can be implemented using the proposed model to detect phishing attacks to safeguard Internet users.",2020.0,2020-07-01 00:00:00,16,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0b3ed9172c5c011cd578b895fed056e28fa20da

Based on observations from four monitoring wells, the persistence and periodicities of the loose porous aquifers, and the interrelation between precipitation and groundwater levels was examined based on a number of tools including autocorrelation, cross-correlation, spectral analysis, and wavelet transform. The results show that the groundwater levels at W1 and W2 present a downward trend while those at W3 and W4 show an upward trend. The dominant time period increases from 2.1 years (upstream) to 3.7 years (downstream). The time lags between aquifers and rainfall at W1, W2, W3 and W4 are 139.14 ± 59.76 days (2008–2020), 23.27 ± 12.03 days (2005–2014), 145.01 ± 68.00 days (2007–2020), and 59.22 ± 26.14 days (2005–2019), respectively. The lags for the pumping years are 1.2~2.1 times of those during the years without pumping. The recharge ratio overestimated by the water table fluctuation method decreases from 0.32 at W2 to 0.17 at W4, suggesting that the site W2 has a good potentiality for groundwater recharge. This research helps us better understand the local groundwater circulation and provide references for groundwater management.",2023.0,2023-03-13 00:00:00,5,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2b34f16c18b81e2c8490155f9988ebae5208cfc
10.3390/app13042743,"A Comprehensive Review of Conventional, Machine Leaning, and Deep Learning Models for Groundwater Level (GWL) Forecasting","Groundwater level (GWL) refers to the depth of the water table or the level of water below the Earth’s surface in underground formations. It is an important factor in managing and sustaining the groundwater resources that are used for drinking water, irrigation, and other purposes. Groundwater level prediction is a critical aspect of water resource management and requires accurate and efficient modelling techniques. This study reviews the most commonly used conventional numerical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting GWL. Significant advancements have been made in terms of prediction efficiency over the last two decades. However, while researchers have primarily focused on predicting monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly GWL, water managers and strategists require multi-year GWL simulations to take effective steps towards ensuring the sustainable supply of groundwater. In this paper, we consider a collection of state-of-the-art theories to develop and design a novel methodology and improve modelling efficiency in this field of evaluation. We examined 109 research articles published from 2008 to 2022 that investigated different modelling techniques. Finally, we concluded that machine learning and deep learning approaches are efficient for modelling GWL. Moreover, we provide possible future research directions and recommendations to enhance the accuracy of GWL prediction models and improve relevant understanding.",2023.0,2023-02-20 00:00:00,40,108,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f10f08144948ca306a21cd992020fef016e7c689

10.1002/cai2.136,Explainable artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection and risk prediction: A systematic scoping review,"Abstract With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), data‐driven algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain. However, due to the nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision‐making by such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black‐box process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on peer‐reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets. Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top model‐agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage, explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model primarily explained tree‐based ensemble machine learning models. The most common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as tree‐based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability, fairness, and trustworthiness of AI‐enabled health systems and medical devices and, ultimately, the quality of care and outcomes.",2024.0,2024-07-03 00:00:00,8,146,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/305546cb41590a9566f8c812bb9a0537b598981b

First, the classification and regression tree featuring Gini index is applied to explore the classification criteria of high potassium glass and lead barium glass, and the accuracy of the model is tested by 10-fold cross-validation. Secondly, subclasses were classified for the collected sample data. In this paper, Two Step Cluster Algorithm is used to divide the high potassium glass into four subclasses and the lead barium glass into five subclasses based on the Euclidean distance between the samples.

10.3390/math11071650,Predictive Modeling of the Uniaxial Compressive Strength of Rocks Using an Artificial Neural Network Approach,"Sedimentary rocks provide information on previous environments on the surface of the Earth. As a result, they are the principal narrators of the former climate, life, and important events on the surface of the Earth. The complexity and cost of direct destructive laboratory tests adversely affect the data scarcity problem, making the development of intelligent indirect methods an integral step in attempts to address the problem faced by rock engineering projects. This study established an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to predict the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) in MPa of sedimentary rocks using different input parameters; i.e., dry density (ρd) in g/cm3, Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) in MPa, and wet density (ρwet) in g/cm3. The developed ANN models, M1, M2, and M3, were divided as follows: the overall dataset, 70% training dataset and 30% testing dataset, and 60% training dataset and 40% testing dataset, respectively. In addition, multiple linear regression (MLR) was performed for comparison to the proposed ANN models to verify the accuracy of the predicted values. The performance indices were also calculated by estimating the established models. The predictive performance of the M2 ANN model in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), variance accounts for (VAF), and a20-index was 0.831, 0.27672, 0.92, and 0.80, respectively, in the testing dataset, revealing ideal results, thus it was proposed as the best-fit prediction model for UCS of sedimentary rocks at the Thar coalfield, Pakistan, among the models developed in this study. Moreover, by performing a sensitivity analysis, it was determined that BTS was the most influential parameter in predicting UCS.",2023.0,2023-03-29 00:00:00,17,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34e6ee72e294c915f7218656fc779ec238bab019
10.3390/app13063718,Application of Support Vector Machine Algorithm Incorporating Slime Mould Algorithm Strategy in Ancient Glass Classification,"Glass products are important evidence of early East–West cultural exchanges. Ancient glass in China mostly consisted of lead glass, and potassium glass is widely believed to be imported abroad. In order to figure out the origin of glass artefacts, it is crucial to define the type of glass products accurately. In contemporary research on the chemical composition of ancient glass products, potassium glass is separated from lead glass primarily by the weight ratio of oxides or the proportion of lead-containing compounds. This approach can be excessively subjective and prone to mistakes while calculating the mass fraction of compounds containing potassium. So, it is better to find out the link between the proportion of glass’s chemical composition and its classifications during the weathering process of the glass products, to develop an effective classification model using machine learning techniques. In this research, we suggest employing the slime mould approach to optimise the parameters of a support vector machine and examine a 69-group glass chemical composition dataset. In addition, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared to those of commonly used classification models: decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and support vector machines optimised by genetic algorithms (GA-SVM). The results of this research indicated that the support vector machine method with the sticky slime mould algorithm strategy is the most effective. On the training set, 100% accuracy was attained, while on the test set, 97.50% accuracy was attained in this research. The research results demonstrate that the support vector machine algorithm combining the slime mould algorithm strategy is capable of providing a trustworthy classification reference for future glass artefacts.",2023.0,2023-03-14 00:00:00,15,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3291d5f8212a1e38afeb5efba6af06244befccba
10.3390/pr11010174,Research on Gas Concentration Prediction Based on the ARIMA-LSTM Combination Model,"The current single gas prediction model is not sufficient for identifying and processing all the characteristics of mine gas concentration time series data. This paper proposes an ARIMA-LSTM combined forecasting model based on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. In the ARIMA-LSTM model, the ARIMA model is used to process the historical data of gas time series and obtain the corresponding linear prediction results and residual series. The LSTM model is used in further analysis of the residual series, predicting the nonlinear factors in the residual series. The prediction results of the combined model are compared separately with those of the two single models. Finally, RMSE, MAPE and R2 are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the three models. The results of the study show that the metrics of the combined ARIMA-LSTM model are R2 = 0.9825, MAPE = 0.0124 and RMSE = 0.083. The combined model has the highest prediction accuracy and the lowest error and is more suitable for the predictive analysis of gas data. By comparing the prediction results of a single model and the combined model on gas time series data, the applicability, validity and scientificity of the combined model proposed in this paper are verified, which is of great importance to accurate prediction and early warning of underground gas danger in coal mines.",2023.0,2023-01-05 00:00:00,10,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8da2b038706241b3f30aef9027bdf116c0cac4a7

Cloud computing provides different services over the internet, thus eliminating the need for personalized hardware and other resources. Cloud computing environments face some challenges in terms of resource utilization, energy efficiency, heterogeneous resources, etc. Tasks scheduling and virtual machines (VMs) are used as consolidation techniques in order to tackle these issues. Tasks scheduling has been extensively studied in the literature. The problem has been studied with different parameters and objectives. In this article, we address the problem of energy consumption and efficient resource utilization in virtualized cloud data centers. The proposed algorithm is based on task classification and thresholds for efficient scheduling and better resource utilization. In the first phase, workflow tasks are pre-processed to avoid bottlenecks by placing tasks with more dependencies and long execution times in separate queues. In the next step, tasks are classified based on the intensities of the required resources. Finally, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to select the best schedules. Experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Comparative results obtained on benchmark datasets are presented.

10.3390/s17112556,Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Human Activity Recognition,"Adopting deep learning methods for human activity recognition has been effective in extracting discriminative features from raw input sequences acquired from body-worn sensors. Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time, typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However, the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result, typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity-recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper, we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional, bidirectional, and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on miscellaneous benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform methods employing conventional machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Additionally, the proposed models yield better performance than other deep learning techniques, such as deep believe networks (DBNs) and CNNs.",2017.0,2017-11-01 00:00:00,382,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/899db02ba28ef2479b5bea3e51627685be5b3865

10.3389/fpubh.2023.1024195,Toward explainable AI-empowered cognitive health assessment,"Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is of paramount importance to various domains, including healthcare, fitness, skill assessment, and personal assistants, to understand and explain the decision-making process of the artificial intelligence (AI) model. Smart homes embedded with smart devices and sensors enabled many context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. This study presents XAI-HAR, a novel XAI-empowered human activity recognition (HAR) approach based on key features identified from the data collected from sensors located at different places in a smart home. XAI-HAR identifies a set of new features (i.e., the total number of sensors used in a specific activity), as physical key features selection (PKFS) based on weighting criteria. Next, it presents statistical key features selection (SKFS) (i.e., mean, standard deviation) to handle the outliers and higher class variance. The proposed XAI-HAR is evaluated using machine learning models, namely, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and deep learning models such as deep neural network (DNN), convolution neural network (CNN), and CNN-based long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of XAI-HAR using RF classifier over all other machine learning and deep learning models. For explainability, XAI-HAR uses Local Interpretable Model Agnostic (LIME) with an RF classifier. XAI-HAR achieves 0.96% of F-score for health and dementia classification and 0.95 and 0.97% for activity recognition of dementia and healthy individuals, respectively.",2023.0,2023-03-09 00:00:00,15,72,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7d6bc4107361d00851fa71e954af0bee8e21515

10.3390/s22030706,Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using Fine-Tuned Convolutional Neural Network,"Hand gesture recognition is one of the most effective modes of interaction between humans and computers due to being highly flexible and user-friendly. A real-time hand gesture recognition system should aim to develop a user-independent interface with high recognition performance. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show high recognition rates in image classification problems. Due to the unavailability of large labeled image samples in static hand gesture images, it is a challenging task to train deep CNN networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet from scratch. Therefore, inspired by CNN performance, an end-to-end fine-tuning method of a pre-trained CNN model with score-level fusion technique is proposed here to recognize hand gestures in a dataset with a low number of gesture images. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOO CV) and regular CV tests on two benchmark datasets.

The process of evaluating a value for the GMFM index can be time consuming. It typically takes 45 to 60 min for the patient to complete all tasks, sometimes in two or more sessions. The diagnostic procedure requires trained and specialized therapists. The paper presents the estimation of the GMFM measure for patients with cerebral palsy based on the results of the Zebris FDM-T treadmill. For this purpose, the regression analysis was used. Estimations based on the Generalized Linear Regression were assessed using different error metrics. The results obtained showed that the GMFM score can be estimated with acceptable accuracy. Because the Zebris FDM-T is a widely used device in gait rehabilitation, our method has the potential to be widely adopted for objective diagnostics of children with cerebral palsy.",2022.0,2022-02-01 00:00:00,5,71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ee0bdbb1395ac1ba4e428b0fa00365776790c2a

10.36227/techrxiv.16718788,A-GAS: A Probabilistic Approach for Generating Automated Gait Assessment Score for Cerebral Palsy Children,"Gait disorders in children with cerebral palsy (CP) affect their mental, physical, economic, and social lives. Gait assessment is one of the essential steps of gait management. It has been widely used for clinical decision making and evaluation of different treatment outcomes. However, most of the present methods of gait assessment are subjective, less sensitive to small pathological changes, time-taking and need a great effort of an expert. This work proposes an automated, comprehensive gait assessment score (A-GAS) for gait disorders in CP. Kinematic data of 356 CP and 41 typically developing subjects is used to validate the performance of A-GAS. For the computation of A-GAS, instance abnormality index (AII) and abnormality index (AI) are calculated. AII quantifies gait abnormality of a gait cycle instance, while AI quantifies gait abnormality of a joint angle profile during walking. AII is calculated for all gait cycle instances by performing probabilistic and statistical analyses. Abnormality index (AI) is a weighted sum of AII, computed for each joint angle profile. A-GAS is a weighted sum of AI, calculated for a lower limb. Moreover, a graphical representation of the gait assessment report, including AII, AI, and A-GAS is generated for providing a better depiction of the assessment score. Furthermore, the work compares A-GAS with a present rating-based gait assessment scores to understand fundamental differences. Finally, A-GAS’s performance is verified for a high-cost multi-camera set-up using nine joint angle profiles and a low-cost single camera set-up using three joint angle profiles. Results show no significant differences in performance of A-GAS for both the set-ups. Therefore, A-GAS for both the set-ups can be used interchangeably.",2021.0,2021-10-05 00:00:00,9,48,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dac867f746dc5420a41f4b88cfe8fe4df083f5b2

A large number of them are installed using trenchless Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) technology. The aim of this work was to develop and compare new machine learning models dedicated for risk assessment in HDD projects. The data from 133 HDD projects from eight countries of the world were gathered, profiled, and preprocessed. Three machine learning models, logistic regression, random forests, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were developed to predict the overall HDD project outcome (failure free installation or installation likely to fail), and the occurrence of identified unwanted events. The best performance in terms of recall and accuracy was achieved for the developed ANN model, which proved to be efficient, fast and robust in predicting risks in HDD projects. Machine learning applications in the proposed models enabled eliminating the involvement of a group of experts in the risk assessment process and therefore significantly lower the costs associated with the risk assessment process. Future research may be oriented towards developing a comprehensive risk management system, which will enable dynamic risk assessment taking into account various combinations of risk mitigation actions.",2021.0,2021-01-07 00:00:00,13,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4232ee48e7c2408f8c6dddca3d4fca3cee4a7cd8

Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixty-eight individuals (mean age 13.3 ± 5.7 years; 35% female, 92% Caucasian) were randomized to HCLC followed by SAP therapy (intensive group; N = 48) or to the usual-care group treated with multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy (N = 20). Primary outcome was C-peptide concentrations during mixed-meal tolerance tests at 12 months. RESULTS Intensive-group participants initiated HCLC a median of 6 days after diagnosis for a median duration of 71.3 h, during which median participant mean glucose concentration was 140 mg/dL (interquartile range 134–153 mg/dL). During outpatient SAP, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use decreased over time, and at 12 months, only 33% of intensive participants averaged sensor use ≥6 days/week. In the usual-care group, insulin pump and CGM use were initiated prior to 12 months by 15 and 5 participants, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were similar in both groups throughout the study. At 12 months, the geometric mean (95% CI) of C-peptide area under the curve was 0.43 (0.34–0.52) pmol/mL in the intensive group and 0.52 (0.32–0.75) pmol/mL in the usual-care group (P = 0.49). Thirty-seven (79%) intensive and 16 (80%) usual-care participants had a peak C-peptide concentration ≥0.2 pmol/mL (P = 0.30).

10.1371/journal.pone.0046935,"Non-Gaussian Distributions Affect Identification of Expression Patterns, Functional Annotation, and Prospective Classification in Human Cancer Genomes","Introduction Gene expression data is often assumed to be normally-distributed, but this assumption has not been tested rigorously. We investigate the distribution of expression data in human cancer genomes and study the implications of deviations from the normal distribution for translational molecular oncology research. Methods We conducted a central moments analysis of five cancer genomes and performed empiric distribution fitting to examine the true distribution of expression data both on the complete-experiment and on the individual-gene levels. We used a variety of parametric and nonparametric methods to test the effects of deviations from normality on gene calling, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification using a sixth cancer genome. Results Central moments analyses reveal statistically-significant deviations from normality in all of the analyzed cancer genomes. We observe as much as 37% variability in gene calling, 39% variability in functional annotation, and 30% variability in prospective, molecular tumor subclassification associated with this effect. Conclusions Cancer gene expression profiles are not normally-distributed, either on the complete-experiment or on the individual-gene level. Instead, they exhibit complex, heavy-tailed distributions characterized by statistically-significant skewness and kurtosis. The non-Gaussian distribution of this data affects identification of differentially-expressed genes, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification. These effects may be reduced in some circumstances, although not completely eliminated, by using nonparametric analytics. This analysis highlights two unreliable assumptions of translational cancer gene expression analysis: that “small” departures from normality in the expression data distributions are analytically-insignificant and that “robust” gene-calling algorithms can fully compensate for these effects.",2012.0,2012-10-31 00:00:00,30,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/687186174d2fb660e182edd489be50cbf649a4b3

10.3390/bioengineering10121421,A Critical Assessment of Generative Models for Synthetic Data Augmentation on Limited Pneumonia X-ray Data,"In medical imaging, deep learning models serve as invaluable tools for expediting diagnoses and aiding specialized medical professionals in making clinical decisions. However, effectively training deep learning models typically necessitates substantial quantities of high-quality data, a resource often lacking in numerous medical imaging scenarios. One way to overcome this deficiency is to artificially generate such images. Therefore, in this comparative study we train five generative models to artificially increase the amount of available data in such a scenario. This synthetic data approach is evaluated on a a downstream classification task, predicting four causes for pneumonia as well as healthy cases on 1082 chest X-ray images. Quantitative and medical assessments show that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach significantly outperforms more recent diffusion-based approaches on this limited dataset with better image quality and pathological plausibility. We show that better image quality surprisingly does not translate to improved classification performance by evaluating five different classification models and varying the amount of additional training data. Class-specific metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score show a substantial improvement by using synthetic images, emphasizing the data rebalancing effect of less frequent classes. However, overall performance does not improve for most models and configurations, except for a DreamBooth approach which shows a +0.52 improvement in overall accuracy. The large variance of performance impact in this study suggests a careful consideration of utilizing generative models for limited data scenarios, especially with an unexpected negative correlation between image quality and downstream classification improvement.",2023.0,2023-12-01 00:00:00,4,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db5ccb1d7e75c23995a42806e8ea2e03b074269d

10.2478/popets-2021-0071,Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption from Ring-Learning-with-Errors,"Abstract We propose and evaluate a secure-multiparty-computation (MPC) solution in the semi-honest model with dishonest majority that is based on multiparty homomorphic encryption (MHE). To support our solution, we introduce a multiparty version of the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic cryptosystem and implement it in an open-source library. MHE-based MPC solutions have several advantages: Their transcript is public, their o~ine phase is compact, and their circuit-evaluation procedure is noninteractive. By exploiting these properties, the communication complexity of MPC tasks is reduced from quadratic to linear in the number of parties, thus enabling secure computation among potentially thousands of parties and in a broad variety of computing paradigms, from the traditional peer-to-peer setting to cloud-outsourcing and smart-contract technologies. MHE-based approaches can also outperform the state-of-the-art solutions, even for a small number of parties. We demonstrate this for three circuits: private input selection with application to private-information retrieval, component-wise vector multiplication with application to private-set intersection, and Beaver multiplication triples generation. For the first circuit, privately selecting one input among eight thousand parties’ (of 32 KB each) requires only 1.31 MB of communication per party and completes in 61.7 seconds. For the second circuit with eight parties, our approach is 8.6 times faster and requires 39.3 times less communication than the current methods. For the third circuit and ten parties, our approach generates 20 times more triples per second while requiring 136 times less communication per-triple than an approach based on oblivious transfer.

This study aimed at developing a predictor model to estimate time on a kidney transplant waiting list using a machine learning approach. Methods A retrospective cohort study including data of patients registered, between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, in the waiting list of São Paulo State Organ Allocation System (SP-OAS) /Brazil. Data were randomly divided into two groups: 75% for training and 25% for testing. A Cox regression model was fitted with deceased donor transplant as the outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different Cox models. Cox hazard ratios were used to develop the risk-prediction equations. Results Of 54,055 records retrieved, 48,153 registries were included in the final analysis. During the study period, approximately 1/3 of the patients were transplanted with a deceased donor. The major characteristics associated with changes in the likelihood of transplantation were age, subregion, cPRA, and frequency of HLA-DR, -B and -A. The model developed was able to predict waiting time with good agreement in internal validation (c-index = 0.70). Conclusion The kidney transplant waiting time calculator developed shows good predictive performance and provides information that may be valuable in assisting candidates and their providers.

We retrospectively evaluated the data of kidney transplant procedures until hospital discharge, according to kidney function recovery after the procedure. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the non-sensitized, 1st KTx from deceased donors performed between Jan/2010 to Dec/2017. Results: Out of the 1300 KTx from deceased donors performed in this period, 730 patients were studied and divided into 3 groups: Immediate Renal Function (IRF) - decrease in serum creatinine ≥ 10% on two consecutive days; Delayed Graft Function (DGF) - decrease in serum creatinine <10% on two consecutive days, without the need for dialysis, and Dialysis (D) - need for dialysis during the first week. Patients in group D stayed longer in the hospital compared to DGF and IRF (21, 11 and 8 days respectively, p < 0.001). More D patients (21%) were admitted to the ICU and performed a greater number of laboratory tests (p < 0.001) and renal biopsies (p < 0.001), in addition to receiving a higher amount of immunosuppressants. Total hospital costs were higher in group D and DGF compared to IRF (U$ 7.021,48; U$ 3.603,42 and U$ 2.642,37 respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The costs of the transplant procedure is impacted by the recovery of kidney function after the transplant.

Despite this success, the high risk of premature death and frequent occurrence of graft failure remain important clinical and research challenges. The current burst of studies and other innovative initiatives using artificial intelligence (AI) for a wide range of analytical and practical applications in biomedical areas seems to correlate with the same trend observed in publications in the kidney transplantation field, and points toward the potential of such novel approaches to address the aforementioned aim of improving long-term outcomes of kidney transplant recipients (KTR). However, at the same time, this trend underscores now more than ever the old methodological challenges and potential threats that the research and clinical community needs to be aware of and actively look after with regard to AI-driven evidence. The purpose of this narrative mini-review is to explore challenges for obtaining applicable and adequate kidney transplant data for analyses using AI techniques to develop prediction models, and to propose next steps in the field. We make a call to act toward establishing the strong collaborations needed to bring innovative synergies further augmented by AI, which have the potential to impact the long-term care of KTR.

Early prediction of subclinical mastitis can enable dairy farmers to perform interventions to mitigate its effect. The present study investigated how well predictive models built using machine learning techniques can detect subclinical mastitis up to 7 d before its occurrence. The data set used consisted of 1,346,207 milk-day (i.e., a day when milk was collected on both morning and evening) records spanning 9 yr from 2,389 cows producing on 7 Irish research farms. Individual cow composite milk yield and maximum milk flow were available twice daily, whereas milk composition (i.e., fat, lactose, protein) and somatic cell count (SCC) were collected once per week. Other features describing parity, calving dates, predicted transmitting ability for SCC, body weight, and history of subclinical mastitis were also available. The results of the study showed that a gradient boosting machine model trained to predict the onset of subclinical mastitis 7 d before a subclinical case occurs achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 69.45 and 95.64%, respectively. Reduced data collection frequency, where milk composition and SCC were recorded only every 15, 30, 45, and 60 d was simulated by masking data, to reflect the frequency of recording of this data on commercial dairy farms in Ireland. The sensitivity and specificity scores reduced as recording frequency reduced with respective scores of 66.93 and 80.43% when milk composition and SCC were recorded just every 60 d. Results demonstrate that models built on data that could be recorded routinely available on commercial dairy farms, can achieve useful predictive ability of subclinical mastitis even with reduced frequency of milk composition and SCC recording.",2023.0,2023-05-31 00:00:00,10,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49ba8208c07bfc0ca202ffdaecc406e0a4b504be

We studied the effect of mastitis on cow milk yield, the effect of mastitis on udder surface skin temperature, and the dependence between severity of mastitis and udder temperature. We determined the presence of a significant relationship between the udder surface skin temperature and the milk yield of mastitis cows (Coefficient of determination = 0.886, linear Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.96), as well as the absence of a significant relationship between the udder surface skin temperature and the milk yield of healthy cows (Coefficient of determination = 0.029, linear Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.16). We substantiated the temperature ranges of the udder surface of healthy cows [32–35.9 °C] and mastitis [36.1–39 °C]. The obtained data made it possible to form an algorithm that allows a quick assessment of the herd for the presence of udder disease, using infrared images of the udder surface skin temperature.",2022.0,2022-06-30 00:00:00,11,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc51d5c2a09651d13e1f7e12814b724b484d0d82

In this study, we adopt eight machine learning algorithms using an R software for analyzing a dataset of 14-dimensions of dairy cows with health disorders across the whole lactation period in intensive Chinese dairy farms, applying automatic monitoring systems and milking systems. The variables analyzed by the machine learning algorithms include milk yield, physical activity, changes in rumination time, and the electrical conductivity of milk. Six parameters were presented to evaluate the performance metrics of the models, with the Rpart algorithm outperforming others and indicating a strong generalization ability of this algorithm. A total of 10 variables of greater importance in three models of Rpart, eXtreme Gradient, and Adaboost demonstrated the consistency of those variables as predictors for disorders of dairy cows monitored by automatic systems. The results obtained in this study highlighted the importance of using big data on the farm to develop predictive and prescriptive decision support tools to boost the development of precision livestock farming. Abstract We use multidimensional data from automated monitoring systems and milking systems to predict disorders of dairy cows by employing eight machine learning algorithms. The data included the season, days in milking, parity, age at the time of disorders, milk yield (kg/day), activity (unitless), six variables related to rumination time, and two variables related to the electrical conductivity of milk. We analyze 131 sick cows and 149 healthy cows with identical lactation days and parity; all data are collected on the same day, which corresponds to the diagnosis day for disordered cows. For disordered cows, each variable, except the ratio of rumination time from daytime to nighttime, displays a decreasing/increasing trend from d-7 or d-3 to d0 and/or d-1, with the d0, d-1, or d-2 values reaching the minimum or maximum. The test data sensitivity for three algorithms exceeded 80%, and the accuracies of the eight algorithms ranged from 65.08% to 84.21%. The area under the curve (AUC) of the three algorithms was >80%. Overall, Rpart best predicts the disorders with an accuracy, precision, and AUC of 81.58%, 92.86%, and 0.908, respectively. The machine learning algorithms may be an appropriate and powerful decision support and monitoring tool to detect herds with common health disorders.",2022.0,2022-05-01 00:00:00,27,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f1cd241a20b3cd0445a4b8892208baca8df5cfe
10.15316/sjafs.2021.237,Early Detection of Mastitis by using Infrared Thermography in Holstein-Friesian Dairy Cows via Classification and Regression Tree (CART) Analysis,"Subclinical mastitis is an important udder disease that negatively affects both the animal health and reduces profitability in dairy farms. The increasing performance of thermal cameras over time and their usability in different areas increase their use in livestocks. Infrared thermography (IRT) technology is a noninvasive method that can estimate the surface temperature of objects. The objective of this study was to evaluate early detection of mastitis in Holstein-Friesian dairy cattle by using both udder surface temperatures (Tmax) from images obtained with the help of a FLIR One Pro thermal camera and some parameters such as Lab (CIE L*, a*, b*), HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness), RGB (Red, Green, Blue) by processing thermal images with the help of ImageJ program via classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. According to CMT by using CART analysis in this study, 64.9% of cows with udder surface temperature lower than 38.85 were healthy, and 73.3% of cows higher than 38.85 were determined as unhealthy. As for SCC, 77.6% of cows with udder surface temperature lower than 38.65 were healthy and 58.6% of cows with higher than 38.65 were determined as unhealthy.

10.7759/cureus.40767,Ninjin’yoeito Improves Genitourinary Symptoms in Patients With Frailty,"Introduction In geriatric medicine, there is currently significant attention on frailty, a condition commonly associated with aging and characterized by muscle weakness and other age-related changes. Within the fields of urology and gynecology, conditions such as overactive bladder (OAB) and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) have been identified as crucial concerns due to their negative impact on the quality of life of elderly individuals. In this study, we investigated the potential of Ninjin'yoeito (NYT), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, as a viable treatment option for frailty. Additionally, we hypothesized that NYT may also contribute to the improvement of symptoms associated with OAB and GSM, and potentially help in reducing the dosage of OAB medications. Methods In this retrospective cohort study conducted from November 2016 to November 2022, we created a website describing the relationship between frailty and genitourinary symptoms in frail patients aged ≥ 65 years with GSM who underwent pelvic floor muscle training. The patients were divided into two propensity score-matched groups: NYT group (received NYT for one year) and no-NYT group (did not receive NYT), based on their wishes. The fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight (FRAIL) scale was used to assess frailty status. Urinary symptoms were evaluated using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). Genital symptoms were investigated using the vaginal health index score and vulvodynia swab test. The value of each score was obtained before (T0) and 12 months after (T12) treatment, and the difference (ΔT0/T12) was calculated. Results During the study period, 985 outpatients visited our clinic, of whom 725 were considered frail/pre-frail; 402 women with frailty/pre-frailty (mean age 77.5 ± 6.49 years) were included, with a median follow-up of 14.5 months. The NYT and no-NYT groups had 220 and 182 patients, respectively. After propensity score matching, each group had 159 patients. ΔT0/T12FRAIL scale score was significantly higher in the NYT group (0.13 ± 0.37) than in the no-NYT (0.01 ± 0.10) group (p=0.001.) However, urinary symptoms improved in the NYT group more than in the no-NYT in terms of the following parameters: ΔT0/T12OABSS (NYT: 0.89 ± 1.65; no-NYTl: 0.36 ± 1.14, p=0.001) and ΔT0/T12ICIQ-SF score (NYT: 1.51 ± 1.75; no-NYT: 0.42 ± 1.18, p<0.001). Genital symptoms were better in the NYT group in terms of ΔT0/T12VHIS (NYT: 0.58 ±1.08; no-NYT: 0.21 ±0.65, p<0.001). The vulvodynia swab test showed improvements in left para-hymen evoked pain in both groups. In the NYT group, 5% of the patients underwent antimuscarinic drug dose reduction for overactive bladder treatment. NYT use was not associated with significant side effects, and only 0.6% of patients reported drug allergies. Conclusion NYT improved activity levels in frail/pre-frail patients. Moreover, NYT use improved various genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with frailty/pre-frailty. Treatment with NYT may reduce the dose of overactive bladder medications. The anticholinergic load-reducing effect of NYT may help solve the problem of polypharmacy.",2023.0,2023-06-01 00:00:00,7,30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/942eef8c9af358a582335a2ebc78fe513a726913

However, its therapeutic efficacy and safety have not been thoroughly reviewed in elderly patients. This study aims to provide treatment outcomes for patients aged ≥75 years, and to identify factors associated with unfavorable outcomes. Patients receiving intradetrusor injections of 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA for refractory OAB between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Urodynamic parameters, underlying comorbidities, subjective success, and unfavorable outcomes were assessed. A total of 192 patients were included, and 65 of them were classified into the elderly group. For the elderly group, 60.0% experienced subjective dryness, and 84.6% remained subjective success at 6 months after the injections. The prevalence rates of common unfavorable outcomes, including urinary tract infections, large post-void residual urine volume, and urinary retention, were 9.2%, 27.7%, and 12.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that female, baseline urodynamic parameters, and diabetes mellitus were associated with unfavorable outcomes in the elderly group. Intravesical BoNT-A injections provide comparable therapeutic efficacy and safety concerns in elderly patients with refractory OAB. A thorough consultation for treatment benefits and possible adverse events is mandatory before the procedure.",2023.0,2023-01-19 00:00:00,7,64,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/769d1c2c6ba34e7df6a2e1d5dc52c7d08dd8de81
10.3389/fcimb.2022.1030315,Unraveling the impact of Lactobacillus spp. and other urinary microorganisms on the efficacy of mirabegron in female patients with overactive bladder,"Objective Overactive bladder (OAB) is a disease that seriously affects patients’ quality of life and mental health. To address this issue, more and more researchers are examining the relationship between OAB treatment and urinary microecology. In this study, we sought to determine whether differences in treatment efficacy were related to microbiome diversity and composition as well as the abundance of specific genera. Machine learning algorithms were used to construct predictive models for urine microbiota-based treatment of OAB. Methods Urine samples were obtained from 64 adult female OAB patients for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients’ overactive bladder symptom scores (OABSS) were collected before and after mirabegron treatment and patients were divided into effective and ineffective groups. The relationship between the relative abundance of certain genera and OABSS were analyzed. Three machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), supporting vector machine (SVM) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were utilized to predict the therapeutic effect of mirabegron based on the relative abundance of certain genera in OAB patients’ urine microbiome. Results The species composition of the two groups differed. For one, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly higher in the effective group than in the ineffective group. In addition, the relative abundance of Gardnerella and Prevotella in the effective group was significantly lower than in the ineffective group. Alpha-diversity and beta-diversity differed significantly between the two groups. LEfSe analysis revealed that Lactobacillus abundance increased while Prevotella and Gardnerella abundance decreased in the effective group. The Lactobacillus abundance ROC curve had high predictive accuracy. The OABSS after treatment was negatively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus, whereas the relationship between OABSS and Prevotella and Gardnerella showed the opposite trend. In addition, RF, SVM and XGBoost models demonstrated high predictive ability to assess the effect of mirabegron in OAB patients in the test cohort. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that urinary microbiota might influence the efficacy of mirabegron, and that Lactobacillus might be a potential marker for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of mirabegron in OAB patients.",2022.0,2022-11-14 00:00:00,6,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f556c0f2e508e3f1bff1a5d0e0fe50247223108

Methods A total of 233 lung adenocarcinoma patients were investigated and randomly divided into the training and test cohorts. In this study, 2300 radiomic features were extracted from original and filtered (Exponential, Laplacian of Gaussian, Logarithm, Gabor, Wavelet) CT images. The radiomic features were divided into four categories, including histogram, volumetric, morphologic, and texture features. An RF-BFE algorithm was developed to select the features for building the prediction models. Clinicopathological features (including age, gender, smoking status, TNM staging, maximum diameter, location, and growth pattern) were combined to establish an integrated model with radiomic features. ROC curve and AUC quantified the effectiveness of the predictor of EGFR mutation status and subtypes. Results A set of 10 features were selected to predict EGFR mutation status between EGFR mutant and wild type, while 9 selected features were used to predict mutation subtypes between exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation. To predict the EGFR mutation status, the AUC of the training cohort was 0.778 and the AUC of the test cohort was 0.765. To predict the EGFR mutation subtypes, the AUC of training cohort was 0.725 and the AUC of test cohort was 0.657. The integrated model showed the most optimal predictive performance with EGFR mutation status (AUC = 0.870 and 0.759) and subtypes (AUC = 0.797 and 0.554) in the training and test cohorts. Conclusion CT-based radiomic features can extract information on tumor heterogeneity in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we have established a radiomic model and an integrated model to non-invasively predict the EGFR mutation status and subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, which is conducive to saving clinical costs and guiding targeted therapy.",2022.0,2022-05-01 00:00:00,5,37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3982d999631bf9cd2f5918791a6f7f02a7583646

10.18653/v1/2021.acl-long.336,PairRE: Knowledge Graph Embeddings via Paired Relation Vectors,"Distance based knowledge graph embedding methods show promising results on link prediction task, on which two topics have been widely studied: one is the ability to handle complex relations, such as N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N, the other is to encode various relation patterns, such as symmetry/antisymmetry. However, the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same time, which leads to unsatisfactory results. To mitigate this problem, we propose PairRE, a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. The paired vectors enable an adaptive adjustment of the margin in loss function to fit for different complex relations. Besides, PairRE is capable of encoding three important relation patterns, symmetry/antisymmetry, inverse and composition. Given simple constraints on relation representations, PairRE can encode subrelation further. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities of PairRE.

10.3390/ijms21072563,SAAMBE-3D: Predicting Effect of Mutations on Protein–Protein Interactions,"Maintaining wild type protein–protein interactions is essential for the normal function of cell and any mutation that alter their characteristics can cause disease. Therefore, the ability to correctly and quickly predict the effect of amino acid mutations is crucial for understanding disease effects and to be able to carry out genome-wide studies. Here, we report a new development of the SAAMBE method, SAAMBE-3D, which is a machine learning-based approach, resulting in accurate predictions and is extremely fast. It achieves the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 0.82 depending on the training protocol in benchmarking five-fold validation test against the SKEMPI v2.0 database and outperforms currently existing algorithms on various blind-tests. Furthermore, optimized and tested via five-fold cross-validation on the Cornell University dataset, the SAAMBE-3D achieves AUC of 1.0 and 0.96 on a homo and hereto-dimer test datasets. Another important feature of SAAMBE-3D is that it is very fast, it takes less than a fraction of a second to complete a prediction. SAAMBE-3D is available as a web server and as well as a stand-alone code, the last one being another important feature allowing other researchers to directly download the code and run it on their local computer. Combined all together, SAAMBE-3D is an accurate and fast software applicable for genome-wide studies to assess the effect of amino acid mutations on protein–protein interactions. The webserver and the stand-alone codes (SAAMBE-3D for predicting the change of binding free energy and SAAMBE-3D-DN for predicting if the mutation is disruptive or non-disruptive) are available.",2020.0,2020-04-01 00:00:00,69,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e88829e362d6b8ec8b908a89f9287a5e7d220a48

10.3390/s21134605,Received Signal Strength Fingerprinting-Based Indoor Location Estimation Employing Machine Learning,"The fingerprinting technique is a popular approach to reveal location of persons, instruments or devices in an indoor environment. Typically based on signal strength measurement, a power level map is created first in the learning phase to align with measured values in the inference. Second, the location is determined by taking the point for which the recorded received power level is closest to the power level actually measured. The biggest limit of this technique is the reliability of power measurements, which may lack accuracy in many wireless systems. To this end, this work extends the power level measurement by using multiple anchors and multiple radio channels and, consequently, considers different approaches to aligning the actual measurements with the recorded values. The dataset is available online. This article focuses on the very popular radio technology Bluetooth Low Energy to explore the possible improvement of the system accuracy through different machine learning approaches. It shows how the accuracy–complexity trade-off influences the possible candidate algorithms on an example of three-channel Bluetooth received signal strength based fingerprinting in a one dimensional environment with four static anchors and in a two dimensional environment with the same set of anchors.

10.1093/gigascience/giab065,SimFFPE and FilterFFPE: improving structural variant calling in FFPE samples,"Abstract Background Artifact chimeric reads are enriched in next-generation sequencing data generated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Previous work indicated that these reads are characterized by erroneous split-read support that is interpreted as evidence of structural variants. Thus, a large number of false-positive structural variants are detected. To our knowledge, no tool is currently available to specifically call or filter structural variants in FFPE samples. To overcome this gap, we developed 2 R packages: SimFFPE and FilterFFPE. Results SimFFPE is a read simulator, specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data from FFPE samples. A mixture of characteristic artifact chimeric reads, as well as normal reads, is generated. FilterFFPE is a filtration algorithm, removing artifact chimeric reads from sequencing data while keeping real chimeric reads. To evaluate the performance of FilterFFPE, we performed structural variant calling with 3 common tools (Delly, Lumpy, and Manta) with and without prior filtration with FilterFFPE. After applying FilterFFPE, the mean positive predictive value improved from 0.27 to 0.48 in simulated samples and from 0.11 to 0.27 in real samples, while sensitivity remained basically unchanged or even slightly increased. Conclusions FilterFFPE improves the performance of SV calling in FFPE samples. It was validated by analysis of simulated and real data.",2021.0,2021-09-01 00:00:00,5,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f115ab3c9738a1ebe13aebd7332f6a6a76c2cb07

These genes have the greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have diverse molecular functions that include the formation, structure, and function of the synapse. The associations of NMDA receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for the dysfunction of the glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We find significant evidence for an overlap of rare variant risk between schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and severe neurodevelopmental disorders (DD/ID), supporting a neurodevelopmental etiology for schizophrenia. We show that protein-truncating variants in GRIN2A, TRIO, and CACNA1G confer risk for schizophrenia whereas specific missense mutations in these genes confer risk for DD/ID. Nevertheless, few of the strongly associated schizophrenia genes appear to confer risk for DD/ID. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare variant risk, suggesting that common and rare genetic risk factors at least partially converge on the same underlying pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry a substantial excess of URVs, implying that more schizophrenia risk genes await discovery using this approach.",2020.0,2020-09-18 00:00:00,108,80,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0700d2bf8e5a7f57f262a574f1d6005795936054

In this study, we conducted a TWAS using gene expression data from GTEx and summary statistics from the hitherto largest GWAS meta-analysis conducted for breast cancer overall, and by estrogen receptor subtypes (ER+ and ER−). We further compared associations with ER+ and ER− subtypes, using a case-only TWAS approach. We also conducted multigene conditional analyses in regions with multiple TWAS associations. Two genes, STXBP4 and HIST2H2BA, were specifically associated with ER+ but not with ER− breast cancer. We further identified 30 TWAS-significant genes associated with overall breast cancer risk, including four that were not identified in previous studies.

10.3390/EN14092524,Short-Term Load Forecasting Using Encoder-Decoder WaveNet: Application to the French Grid,"The prediction of time series data applied to the energy sector (prediction of renewable energy production, forecasting prosumers’ consumption/generation, forecast of country-level consumption, etc.) has numerous useful applications. Nevertheless, the complexity and non-linear behaviour associated with such kind of energy systems hinder the development of accurate algorithms. In such a context, this paper investigates the use of a state-of-art deep learning architecture in order to perform precise load demand forecasting 24-h-ahead in the whole country of France using RTE data. To this end, the authors propose an encoder-decoder architecture inspired by WaveNet, a deep generative model initially designed by Google DeepMind for raw audio waveforms. WaveNet uses dilated causal convolutions and skip-connection to utilise long-term information. This kind of novel ML architecture presents different advantages regarding other statistical algorithms. On the one hand, the proposed deep learning model’s training process can be parallelized in GPUs, which is an advantage in terms of training times compared to recurrent networks. On the other hand, the model prevents degradations problems (explosions and vanishing gradients) due to the residual connections. In addition, this model can learn from an input sequence to produce a forecast sequence in a one-shot manner. For comparison purposes, a comparative analysis between the most performing state-of-art deep learning models and traditional statistical approaches is presented: Autoregressive-Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-Short-Term-Memory, Gated-Recurrent-Unit (GRU), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), causal 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) and ConvLSTM (Encoder-Decoder).

An accurate prediction of power load can provide a reliable decision for power system management. To solve the limitation of the existing load forecasting methods in dealing with time-series data, causing the poor stability and non-ideal forecasting accuracy, this paper proposed an attention-based encoder-decoder network with Bayesian optimization to do the accurate short-term power load forecasting. Proposed model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with a gated recurrent units (GRU) recurrent neural network with high robustness on time-series data modeling. The temporal attention layer focuses on the key features of input data that play a vital role in promoting the prediction accuracy for load forecasting. Finally, the Bayesian optimization method is used to confirm the model’s hyperparameters to achieve optimal predictions. The verification experiments of 24 h load forecasting with real power load data from American Electric Power (AEP) show that the proposed model outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy and algorithm stability, providing an effective approach for migrating time-serial power load prediction by deep-learning technology.",2021.0,2021-03-13 00:00:00,119,63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca47d9ba0902cdd27ac7b54ed7c94b605da3ecf5

Moreover, a push for electrical vehicle and other economic developments are expected to further increase energy use. To combat these challenges, electrical load forecasting is essential as it supports energy production planning and scheduling, assists with budgeting, and helps identify saving opportunities. Machine learning approaches commonly used for energy forecasting such as feedforward neural networks and support vector regression encounter challenges with capturing time dependencies. Consequently, this paper proposes Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Network (S2S RNN) with Attention for electrical load forecasting. The S2S architecture from language translation is adapted for load forecasting and a corresponding sample generation approach is designed. RNN enables capturing time dependencies present in the load data and S2S model further improves time modeling by combining two RNNs: encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism alleviates the burden of connecting encoder and decoder. The experiments evaluated attention mechanisms with different RNN cells (vanilla, LSTM, and GRU) and with varied time horizons. Results show that S2S with Bahdanau attention outperforms other models. Accuracy decreases as forecasting horizon increases; however, longer input sequences do not always increase accuracy.",2020.0,2020-02-21 00:00:00,131,39,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3c897df9bbdc2fd32f99e5d9fa2ffadff0820e8

10.3390/rs15163999,Exploring Random Forest Machine Learning and Remote Sensing Data for Streamflow Prediction: An Alternative Approach to a Process-Based Hydrologic Modeling in a Snowmelt-Driven Watershed,"Physically based hydrologic models require significant effort and extensive information for development, calibration, and validation. The study explored the use of the random forest regression (RFR), a supervised machine learning (ML) model, as an alternative to the physically based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for predicting streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters near Del Norte, a snowmelt-dominated mountainous watershed of the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Remotely sensed data were used for the random forest machine learning analysis (RFML) and RStudio for data processing and synthesizing. The RFML model outperformed the SWAT model in accuracy and demonstrated its capability in predicting streamflow in this region. We implemented a customized approach to the RFR model to assess the model’s performance for three training periods, across 1991–2010, 1996–2010, and 2001–2010; the results indicated that the model’s accuracy improved with longer training periods, implying that the model trained on a more extended period is better able to capture the parameters’ variability and reproduce streamflow data more accurately. The variable importance (i.e., IncNodePurity) measure of the RFML model revealed that the snow depth and the minimum temperature were consistently the top two predictors across all training periods. The paper also evaluated how well the SWAT model performs in reproducing streamflow data of the watershed with a conventional approach. The SWAT model needed more time and data to set up and calibrate, delivering acceptable performance in annual mean streamflow simulation, with satisfactory index of agreement (d), coefficient of determination (R2), and percent bias (PBIAS) values, but monthly simulation warrants further exploration and model adjustments. The study recommends exploring snowmelt runoff hydrologic processes, dust-driven sublimation effects, and more detailed topographic input parameters to update the SWAT snowmelt routine for better monthly flow estimation. The results provide a critical analysis for enhancing streamflow prediction, which is valuable for further research and water resource management, including snowmelt-driven semi-arid regions.",2023.0,2023-08-11 00:00:00,19,107,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff3900344bb26b5820f482fe889f59787da01fed

10.3390/w14111828,Multi-Variables-Driven Model Based on Random Forest and Gaussian Process Regression for Monthly Streamflow Forecasting,"Due to the inherent non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of original streamflow and the complicated relationship between multi-scale predictors and streamflow, accurate and reliable monthly streamflow forecasting is quite difficult. In this paper, a multi-scale-variables-driven streamflow forecasting (MVDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy and provide more information for decision-making. This framework was realized by integrating random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with multi-scale variables (hydrometeorological and climate predictors) as inputs and is referred to as RF-GPR-MV. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the RF-GPR-MV model, it was implemented for multi-step-ahead monthly streamflow forecasts with horizons of 1 to 12 months for two key hydrological stations in the Jinsha River basin, Southwest China. Other MVDSF models based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and GPR with/without multi-scale variables or the PCC and a backpropagation neural network (BP) or general regression neural network (GRNN), with only previous streamflow and precipitation, namely, PCC-GPR-MV, PCC-GPR-QP, PCC-BP-QP, and PCC-GRNN-QP, respectively, were selected as benchmarks. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model was superior to the other benchmark models in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for almost all forecasting scenarios, especially for forecasting with longer lead times. Additionally, the results also confirmed that the addition of large-scale climate and circulation factors was beneficial for promoting the streamflow forecasting ability, with an average contribution rate of about 15%. The RF in the MVDSF framework improved the forecasting performance, with an average contribution rate of about 25%. This improvement was more pronounced when the lead time exceeded 3 months. Moreover, the proposed model could also provide prediction intervals (PIs) to characterize forecast uncertainty, as supplementary information to further help decision makers in relevant departments to avoid risks in water resources management.",2022.0,2022-06-06 00:00:00,22,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c57b2d4dd51fe40e5b7266dcd750af64f79f5c3

10.1167/iovs.61.6.29,Quasi-Static Optical Coherence Elastography to Characterize Human Corneal Biomechanical Properties,"Purpose Quasi-static optical coherence elastography (OCE) is an emerging technology to investigate corneal biomechanical behavior in situations similar to physiological stress conditions. Herein OCE was applied to evaluate previously inaccessible biomechanical characteristics of human corneal tissue and to study the role of Bowman's layer in corneal biomechanics. Methods Human corneal donor buttons (n = 23) were obtained and Descemet's membrane and endothelium were removed. In 11 corneas, Bowman's layer was ablated by a 20 µm stromal excimer laser ablation. Buttons were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber and subjected to a pressure modulation from 10 to 30 mm Hg, and back to 10 mm Hg, in steps of 1 mm Hg. At each step, a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scan was obtained. Displacements were analyzed by optical flow tracking, and strain over the entire stromal depth was retrieved from the phase gradient of the complex interference signal. Results During pressure increase, corneal tissue moved upward (486–585 nm/mm Hg) but did not fully recover (Δ= 2.63 to 8.64 µm) after pressure decrease. Vertical corneal strain distribution was negative in the anterior and positive in the posterior cornea, indicating simultaneous corneal compression and expansion, respectively.

10.3389/fpubh.2021.619429,Predicting the Risk of Hypertension Based on Several Easy-to-Collect Risk Factors: A Machine Learning Method,"Hypertension is a widespread chronic disease. Risk prediction of hypertension is an intervention that contributes to the early prevention and management of hypertension. The implementation of such intervention requires an effective and easy-to-implement hypertension risk prediction model. This study evaluated and compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms on predicting the risk of hypertension based on easy-to-collect risk factors. A dataset of 29,700 samples collected through a physical examination was used for model training and testing. Firstly, we identified easy-to-collect risk factors of hypertension, through univariate logistic regression analysis. Then, based on the selected features, 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to optimize four models, random forest (RF), CatBoost, MLP neural network and logistic regression (LR), to find the best hyper-parameters on the training set. Finally, the performance of models was evaluated by AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on the test set. The experimental results showed that the RF model outperformed the other three models, and achieved an AUC of 0.92, an accuracy of 0.82, a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.81. In addition, Body Mass Index (BMI), age, family history and waist circumference (WC) are the four primary risk factors of hypertension. These findings reveal that it is feasible to use machine learning algorithms, especially RF, to predict hypertension risk without clinical or genetic data. The technique can provide a non-invasive and economical way for the prevention and management of hypertension in a large population.",2021.0,2021-09-24 00:00:00,32,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e24c87ea6ebb4a8ff106e1e173708f2f807398c1
10.1371/journal.pone.0240370,Predicting hypertension using machine learning: Findings from Qatar Biobank Study,"Background and objective Hypertension, a global burden, is associated with several risk factors and can be treated by lifestyle modifications and medications. Prediction and early diagnosis is important to prevent related health complications. The objective is to construct and compare predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using 987 records of Qataris and long-term residents aged 18+ years from Qatar Biobank. Percentages were used to summarize data and chi-square tests to assess associations. Predictive models of hypertension were constructed and compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of algorithms was assessed using accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Stata and Weka were used for analysis. Results Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother’s history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. All algorithms showed more or less similar performances: Random forest (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.4%, sensitivity = 82.1%), logistic regression (accuracy = 81.1%, PPV = 80.1%, sensitivity = 81.1%) and decision tree (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.2%, sensitivity = 82.1%. In terms of AUC, compared to logistic regression, while random forest performed similarly, decision tree had a significantly lower discrimination ability (p-value<0.05) with AUC’s equal to 85.0, 86.9, and 79.9, respectively. Conclusions Machine learning provides the chance of having a rapid predictive model using non-invasive predictors to screen for hypertension. Future research should consider improving the predictive accuracy of models in larger general populations, including more important predictors and using a variety of algorithms.",2020.0,2020-10-16 00:00:00,56,67,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e561fb94d7840885b96ae884340ead670604092e

10.1198/tech.2003.s770,The Elements of Statistical Learning,"Chapter 11 includes more case studies in other areas, ranging from manufacturing to marketing research. Chapter 12 concludes the book with some commentary about the scienti c contributions of MTS. The Taguchi method for design of experiment has generated considerable controversy in the statistical community over the past few decades. The MTS/MTGS method seems to lead another source of discussions on the methodology it advocates (Montgomery 2003). As pointed out by Woodall et al. (2003), the MTS/MTGS methods are considered ad hoc in the sense that they have not been developed using any underlying statistical theory. Because the “normal” and “abnormal” groups form the basis of the theory, some sampling restrictions are fundamental to the applications. First, it is essential that the “normal” sample be uniform, unbiased, and/or complete so that a reliable measurement scale is obtained. Second, the selection of “abnormal” samples is crucial to the success of dimensionality reduction when OAs are used. For example, if each abnormal item is really unique in the medical example, then it is unclear how the statistical distance MD can be guaranteed to give a consistent diagnosis measure of severity on a continuous scale when the larger-the-better type S/N ratio is used. Multivariate diagnosis is not new to Technometrics readers and is now becoming increasingly more popular in statistical analysis and data mining for knowledge discovery. As a promising alternative that assumes no underlying data model, The Mahalanobis–Taguchi Strategy does not provide suf cient evidence of gains achieved by using the proposed method over existing tools. Readers may be very interested in a detailed comparison with other diagnostic tools, such as logistic regression and tree-based methods. Overall, although the idea of MTS/MTGS is intriguing, this book would be more valuable had it been written in a rigorous fashion as a technical reference. There is some lack of precision even in several mathematical notations. Perhaps a follow-up with additional theoretical justi cation and careful case studies would answer some of the lingering questions.",2003.0,2003-08-01 00:00:00,17827,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0

Here, we report assessments of RNA structure predictions in CASP15, the first CASP exercise that involved RNA structure modeling. Forty two predictor groups submitted models for at least one of twelve RNA-containing targets. These models were evaluated by the RNA-Puzzles organizers and, separately, by a CASP-recruited team using metrics (GDT, lDDT) and approaches (Z-score rankings) initially developed for assessment of proteins and generalized here for RNA assessment. The two assessments independently ranked the same predictor groups as first (AIchemy_RNA2), second (Chen), and third (RNAPolis and GeneSilico, tied); predictions from deep learning approaches were significantly worse than these top ranked groups, which did not use deep learning. Further analyses based on direct comparison of predicted models to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps and X-ray diffraction data support these rankings. With the exception of two RNA-protein complexes, models submitted by CASP15 groups correctly predicted the global fold of the RNA targets. Comparisons of CASP15 submissions to designed RNA nanostructures as well as molecular replacement trials highlight the potential utility of current RNA modeling approaches for RNA nanotechnology and structural biology, respectively. Nevertheless, challenges remain in modeling fine details such as non- canonical pairs, in ranking among submitted models, and in prediction of multiple structures resolved by cryo-EM or crystallography.",2023.0,2023-04-26 00:00:00,38,84,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2113db76fbf1c547d671917ebaf7d0687f4a34d4

Objective The objective of this study was to develop a new method, based on an app for mobile phones called e-EPIDEMIOLOGY, which was designed to collect individual consumption data for a series of foods/drinks, and to compare this app with a previously validated paper food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Methods University students >18 years of age recorded the consumption of certain foods/drinks using e-EPIDEMIOLOGY during 28 consecutive days and then filled out a paper FFQ at the end of the study period. To evaluate the agreement between the categories of habitual consumption for each of the foods/drinks included in the study, cross-classification analysis and a weighted kappa statistic were used. Results A total of 119 participants completed the study (71% female, 85/119; 29% male, 34/119). Cross-classification analysis showed that 79.8% of the participants were correctly classified into the same category and just 1.1% were misclassified into opposite categories. The average weighted kappa statistic was good (κ=.64).

Using this technology, scientists and physicians can observe the entire human genome comprehensively, generating a plethora of new sequencing data. Modern computational analysis entails advanced algorithms for variant detection, as well as complex models for classification. Data science and machine learning play a crucial role in the processing and interpretation of results, using enormous databases and statistics to discover new and support current genotype–phenotype correlations. In clinical practice, this technology has greatly enabled the development of personalized medicine, approaching each patient individually and in accordance with their genetic and biochemical profile. The most propulsive areas include rare disease genomics, oncogenomics, pharmacogenomics, neonatal screening, and infectious disease genomics. Another crucial application of WGS lies in the field of multi-omics, working towards the complete integration of human biomolecular data.

10.3390/sym13040706,X-SDD: A New Benchmark for Hot Rolled Steel Strip Surface Defects Detection,"It is important to accurately classify the defects in hot rolled steel strip since the detection of defects in hot rolled steel strip is closely related to the quality of the final product. The lack of actual hot-rolled strip defect data sets currently limits further research on the classification of hot-rolled strip defects to some extent. In real production, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm has some difficulties, for example, the algorithm is not particularly accurate in classifying some uncommon defects. Therefore, further research is needed on how to apply deep learning to the actual detection of defects on the surface of hot rolled steel strip. In this paper, we proposed a hot rolled steel strip defect dataset called Xsteel surface defect dataset (X-SDD) which contains seven typical types of hot rolled strip defects with a total of 1360 defect images. Compared with the six defect types of the commonly used NEU surface defect database (NEU-CLS), our proposed X-SDD contains more types. Then, we adopt the newly proposed RepVGG algorithm and combine it with the spatial attention (SA) mechanism to verify the effect on the X-SDD. Finally, we apply multiple algorithms to test on our proposed X-SDD to provide the corresponding benchmarks. The test results show that our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 95.10% on the testset, which exceeds other comparable algorithms by a large margin. Meanwhile, our algorithm achieves the best results in Macro-Precision, Macro-Recall and Macro-F1-score metrics.",2021.0,2021-04-17 00:00:00,98,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff8ad53f6591409b3dd1c7947ca32d49ca3dc569
10.3390/ma14081957,Wavelet Scattering and Neural Networks for Railhead Defect Identification,"Accurate and automatic railhead inspection is crucial for the operational safety of railway systems. Deep learning on visual images is effective in the automatic detection of railhead defects, but either intensive data requirements or ignoring defect sizes reduce its applicability. This paper developed a machine learning framework based on wavelet scattering networks (WSNs) and neural networks (NNs) for identifying railhead defects. WSNs are functionally equivalent to deep convolutional neural networks while containing no parameters, thus suitable for non-intensive datasets. NNs can restore location and size information. The publicly available rail surface discrete defects (RSDD) datasets were analyzed, including 67 Type-I railhead images acquired from express tracks and 128 Type-II images captured from ordinary/heavy haul tracks. The ultimate validation accuracy reached 99.80% and 99.44%, respectively. WSNs can extract implicit signal features, and the support vector machine classifier can improve the learning accuracy of NNs by over 6%. Three criteria, namely the precision, recall, and F-measure, were calculated for comparison with the literature. At the pixel level, the developed approach achieved three criteria of around 90%, outperforming former methods. At the defect level, the recall rates reached 100%, indicating all labeled defects were identified. The precision rates were around 75%, affected by the insignificant misidentified speckles (smaller than 20 pixels). Nonetheless, the developed learning framework was effective in identifying railhead defects.",2021.0,2021-04-01 00:00:00,10,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca41132c7a80c07ca516e236dc3bad527e5a9cb1
10.3390/MET11030388,Automatic Detection and Classification of Steel Surface Defect Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Automatic detection of steel surface defects is very important for product quality control in the steel industry. However, the traditional method cannot be well applied in the production line, because of its low accuracy and slow running speed. The current, popular algorithm (based on deep learning) also has the problem of low accuracy, and there is still a lot of room for improvement. This paper proposes a method combining improved ResNet50 and enhanced faster region convolutional neural networks (faster R-CNN) to reduce the average running time and improve the accuracy. Firstly, the image input into the improved ResNet50 model, which add the deformable revolution network (DCN) and improved cutout to classify the sample with defects and without defects. If the probability of having a defect is less than 0.3, the algorithm directly outputs the sample without defects. Otherwise, the samples are further input into the improved faster R-CNN, which adds spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), enhanced feature pyramid networks (FPN), and matrix NMS. The final output is the location and classification of the defect in the sample or without defect in the sample. By analyzing the data set obtained in the real factory environment, the accuracy of this method can reach 98.2%. At the same time, the average running time is faster than other models.",2021.0,2021-02-26 00:00:00,113,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f7c5252b1225008916c3c098bd1f17d6025333e
10.1155/2020/3215681,Wavelet Scattering Transform for ECG Beat Classification,"An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart; it contains rich pathological information on cardiovascular diseases, such as arrhythmia. However, it is difficult to visually analyze ECG signals due to their complexity and nonlinearity. The wavelet scattering transform can generate translation-invariant and deformation-stable representations of ECG signals through cascades of wavelet convolutions with nonlinear modulus and averaging operators. We proposed a novel approach using wavelet scattering transform to automatically classify four categories of arrhythmia ECG heartbeats, namely, nonectopic (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V), and fusion (F) beats. In this study, the wavelet scattering transform extracted 8 time windows from each ECG heartbeat. Two dimensionality reduction methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and time window selection, were applied on the 8 time windows. These processed features were fed to the neural network (NN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifiers for classification. The 4th time window in combination with KNN (k = 4) has achieved the optimal performance with an averaged accuracy, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.3%, 99.6%, 99.5%, and 98.8%, respectively, using tenfold cross-validation. Thus, our proposed model is capable of highly accurate arrhythmia classification and will provide assistance to physicians in ECG interpretation.",2020.0,2020-10-09 00:00:00,82,42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1f4c1222c4d6cd30b6b5fff3fa8a5f4ac544344

This work aims to develop and pilot a methodology to help decision makers target and prioritize sampling investigations and identify contaminated natural resources. Here we use random forest models to predict ∑PFAS in fish tissue; understanding PFAS levels in fish is particularly important in the CRB because fish can be a major component of tribal and indigenous people diet. Geospatial data, including land cover and distances to known or potential PFAS sources and industries, were leveraged as predictors for modeling. Models were developed and evaluated for Washington state and Oregon using limited available empirical data. Mapped predictions show several areas where detectable concentrations of PFAS in fish tissue are predicted to occur, but prior sampling has not yet confirmed. Variable importance is analyzed to identify potentially important sources of PFAS in fish in this region. The cost-effective methodologies demonstrated here can help address sparsity of existing PFAS occurrence data in environmental media in this and other regions while also giving insights into potentially important drivers and sources of PFAS in fish.",2023.0,2023-09-05 00:00:00,10,29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ffbf5c6c0583ee1f4954e2e90be1b37bd4813b5

10.3390/math10244679,Predicting Fraud in Financial Payment Services through Optimized Hyper-Parameter-Tuned XGBoost Model,"Online transactions, medical services, financial transactions, and banking all have their share of fraudulent activity. The annual revenue generated by fraud exceeds $1 trillion. Even while fraud is dangerous for organizations, it may be uncovered with the help of intelligent solutions such as rules engines and machine learning. In this research, we introduce a unique hybrid technique for identifying financial payment fraud by combining nature-inspired-based Hyperparameter tuning with several supervised classifier models, as implemented in a modified version of the XGBoost Algorithm. At the outset, we split out a sample of the full financial payment dataset to use as a test set. We use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing.

10.3390/math10203808,High-Cardinality Categorical Attributes and Credit Card Fraud Detection,"Credit card transactions may contain some categorical attributes with large domains, involving up to hundreds of possible values, also known as high-cardinality attributes. The inclusion of such attributes makes analysis harder, due to results with poorer generalization and higher resource usage. A common practice is, therefore, to ignore such attributes, removing them, albeit wasting the information they provided. Contrariwise, this paper reports our findings on the positive impacts of using high-cardinality attributes on credit card fraud detection. Thus, we present a new algorithm for domain reduction that preserves the fraud-detection capabilities. Experiments applying a deep feedforward neural network on real datasets from a major Brazilian financial institution have shown that, when measured by the F-1 metric, the inclusion of such attributes does improve fraud-detection quality. As a main contribution, this proposed algorithm was able to reduce attribute cardinality, improving the training times of a model while preserving its predictive capabilities.",2022.0,2022-10-15 00:00:00,6,56,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4b3d74379a7c3cfa39f294785cdb496542d2fb2

10.3390/math10091480,Credit Card Fraud Detection Using a New Hybrid Machine Learning Architecture,"The negative effect of financial crimes on financial institutions has grown dramatically over the years. To detect crimes such as credit card fraud, several single and hybrid machine learning approaches have been used. However, these approaches have significant limitations as no further investigation on different hybrid algorithms for a given dataset were studied. This research proposes and investigates seven hybrid machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities with a real word dataset. The developed hybrid models consisted of two phases, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms were used first to detect credit card fraud, then, hybrid methods were constructed based on the best single algorithm from the first phase. Our findings indicated that the hybrid model Adaboost + LGBM is the champion model as it displayed the highest performance. Future studies should focus on studying different types of hybridization and algorithms in the credit card domain.",2022.0,2022-04-28 00:00:00,60,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f74cd160af6595ddeb5ef0d457bb93abfe7adb0a

Deep learning has been widely applied in medical imaging to help automate and improve medical image analysis. Medical imaging techniques such as MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays produce large amounts of data that can be difficult for human experts to accurately interpret and analyze. Deep learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns in medical images, identify abnormal features, and make predictions about patient outcomes. The present research work exposes an automatic classification model to detect brain tumors in brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). The data set is found in the Kaggle repository, which consists of 253 MRI images: 155 with brain tumors and 98 without. The proposed model can classify brain tumor MRI images with 91% accuracy.

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.",2018.0,2018-03-27 00:00:00,989,90,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6b3aeb29b5b4034d84598424b1edfb29acf2a6c

10.3390/math11143198,A Maximally Split and Adaptive Relaxed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Regularized Extreme Learning Machines,"One of the significant features of extreme learning machines (ELMs) is their fast convergence. However, in the big data environment, the ELM based on the Moore–Penrose matrix inverse still suffers from excessive calculation loads. Leveraging the decomposability of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a convex model-fitting problem can be split into a set of sub-problems which can be executed in parallel. Using a maximally splitting technique and a relaxation technique, the sub-problems can be split into multiple univariate sub-problems. On this basis, we propose an adaptive parameter selection method that automatically tunes the key algorithm parameters during training. To confirm the effectiveness of this algorithm, experiments are conducted on eight classification datasets. We have verified the effectiveness of this algorithm in terms of the number of iterations, computation time, and acceleration ratios. The results show that the method proposed by this paper can greatly improve the speed of data processing while increasing the parallelism.",2023.0,2023-07-21 00:00:00,4,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa3eac354d4a22ae12451148e33e774bdb37aebc

Design Prospective feasibility study. Setting The study was conducted in a university setting and participants’ homes. Participants Thirty-five volunteers ≥55 years old were recruited. Intervention Participants were asked to follow a balance exercise programme 7 days a week for 3 weeks using a phone application. Seventeen participants trained for a further 3 weeks. Outcome measures Postural sway measures during quiet standing with feet at shoulder width apart and feet together, one leg standing and tandem stance were measured at baseline, and at the end of the 3 and 6 training weeks; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) assessed participants’ physical activity level before training; and app acceptability was recorded using a user experience questionnaire. Results Participants on the 3 and 6-week programme on average completed 20 (±5) and 38 (±11) days of training, respectively, and all scored moderate to high on the IPAQ. Between baseline and the 3-week assessments, statistically significant improvements were observed for anteroposterior sway, mediolateral sway, sway area during tandem stance, for anteroposterior sway during one leg standing and for sway area during feet together stance. Improvements were observed at 6 week compared with baseline but those between 3 and 6 weeks were not significant. Based on the questionnaire, participants reported that the app is an appropriate tool for balance training (77%), they reported benefits from the training (50%) and found it easy to fit it into daily routine (88%). Conclusion The high level of adherence and improvements observed in the analysed measures demonstrate the feasibility of using an app to train balance in moderately to highly physically active older participants.

As a result, it is crucial for companies to implement robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive data from intrusion, which can lead to significant financial losses. Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) require further enhancements to reduce false positives as well as enhance overall accuracy. To minimize security risks, data analytics and machine learning can be utilized to create data-driven recommendations and decisions based on the input data. This study focuses on developing machine learning models that can identify cyber-attacks and enhance IDS system performance. This paper employed logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest algorithms on the UNSW-NB15 network traffic dataset, utilizing in-depth exploratory data analysis, and feature selection using correlation analysis and random sampling to compare model accuracy and effectiveness. The performance and confusion matrix results indicate that the Random Forest model is the best option for identifying cyber-attacks, with a remarkable F1 score of 97.80%, accuracy of 98.63%, and low false alarm rate of 1.36%, and thus should be considered to improve IDS system security.",2024.0,2024-02-01 00:00:00,18,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2cbb3a46fdd965ad41aeee97896183c5a6210708

A codebook of 198 variables related to different aspects of pre‐attack behavior is applied to a sample of 55 lone actor terrorists. Data were drawn from open‐source materials and complemented where possible with primary sources. Most lone actors are not highly lethal or surreptitious attackers. They are generally poor at maintaining operational security, leak their motivations and capabilities in numerous ways, and generally do so months and even years before an attack. Moreover, the “loneness” thought to define this type of terrorism is generally absent; most lone actors uphold social ties that are crucial to their adoption and maintenance of the motivation and capability to commit terrorist violence. The results offer concrete input for those working to detect and prevent this form of terrorism and argue for a re‐evaluation of the “lone actor” concept.",2018.0,2018-07-01 00:00:00,89,129,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d184695f728f769ea325df7bad6d9e96cecebe6

10.1101/2023.03.25.534208,Autism is Associated with in vivo Changes in Gray Matter Neurite Architecture,"Postmortem investigations in autism have identified anomalies in neural cytoarchitecture across limbic, cerebellar, and neocortical networks. These anomalies include narrow cell mini-columns and variable neuron density. However, difficulty obtaining sufficient post-mortem samples has often prevented investigations from converging on reproducible measures. Recent advances in processing magnetic resonance diffusion weighted images (DWI) make in vivo characterization of neuronal cytoarchitecture a potential alternative to post-mortem studies. Using extensive DWI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmentsm (ABCD®) study 142 individuals with an Autism diagnosis were compared with 8971 controls using a restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) framework that characterized total neurite density (TND), its component restricted normalized directional diffusion (RND), and restricted normalized isotropic diffusion (RNI). A significant decrease in TND was observed in Autism in the right cerebellar cortex (β=-0.005, SE =0.0015, p=0.0267), with significant decreases in RNI and significant increases in RND found diffusely throughout posterior and anterior aspects of the brain, respectively. Furthermore, these regions remained significant in post-hoc analysis when the ASD sample was compared against a subset of 1404 individuals with other psychiatric conditions (pulled from the original 8971). These findings highlight the importance of characterizing neuron cytoarchitecture in Autism and the significance of their incorporation as physiological covariates in future studies. Lay abstract Children with autism have differences in neuron structure unique from the general population and populations with attention, anxiety, and depression disorders. Brain imaging data on over 11,000 children was acquired at ages 9 and 11 years-of-age. Estimates of neuron density were derived from brain imaging data using recently validated techniques and comparative groups were composed using parent reported diagnosis of autism and other common psychiatric disorders. Consistent macro-structural changes in brain have been difficult to replicate and micro-structural changes have been historically difficult to acquire with other methodologies. We identified regional differences in the density of neuron cell bodies, neuron branching, and total neuron density in those with a reported diagnosis of ASD. Findings were consistent when compared against those with other psychiatric disorders in post-hoc analysis. These findings demonstrate the viability and importance of investigating in vivo changes to neurons in those with autism to advance our current understanding of related physiology.",2023.0,2023-03-26 00:00:00,3,86,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8915cc5701ac4bd4877be0c3797ae4057567027d

10.1155/2022/8598305,PAS: Performance-Aware Job Scheduling for Big Data Processing Systems,"Big data analytics has become increasingly vital in many modern enterprise applications such as user profiling and business process optimization. Today’s big data processing systems, such as Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Hive, treat big data applications as a batch of jobs for scheduling. Existing schedulers in production systems often maintain fair allocation without considering application performance and resource utilization simultaneously. It is challenging to perform job scheduling in big data systems to achieve both low turnaround time and high resource utilization due to the high complexity in data processing logics and the dynamic variation in workloads. In this article, we propose a performance-aware scheduler, referred to as PAS, which dynamically schedules big data jobs in Hadoop YARN and Spark and autonomously adjusts scheduling policies to improve application performance and resource utilization. Specifically, PAS schedules multiple concurrent jobs using different policies based on the predicted job completion time and employs a greedy approach and a one-step lookahead strategy to opportunistically maximize the average job performance while still maintaining a satisfactory level of resource utilization. We implement PAS in Hadoop YARN and evaluate its performance with HiBench, a well-known big data processing benchmark. Experimental results show that PAS reduces the average turnaround time by 25% and the makespan by 15% in comparison with four state-of-the-art schedulers.",2022.0,2022-04-12 00:00:00,5,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd131d2937b46e2790ff67241886e8be9efcce38

In recent years, attention has increasingly been paid to human resources (HR), since worker quality and skills represent a growth factor and a real competitive advantage for companies. After having been introduced to sales and marketing departments, artificial intelligence is also starting to guide employee-related decisions within HR management. The purpose is to support decisions that are based not on subjective aspects but on objective data analysis. The goal of this work is to analyse how objective factors influence employee attrition, in order to identify the main causes that contribute to a worker’s decision to leave a company, and to be able to predict whether a particular employee will leave the company. After the training, the obtained model for the prediction of employees’ attrition is tested on a real dataset provided by IBM analytics, which includes 35 features and about 1500 samples. Results are expressed in terms of classical metrics and the algorithm that produced the best results for the available dataset is the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. It reveals the best recall rate (0.54), since it measures the ability of a classifier to find all the positive instances and achieves an overall false negative rate equal to 4.5% of the total observations.",2020.0,2020-11-03 00:00:00,132,40,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a8cb4bf9fbeb3abf2daf5588b3f5bf5599dcea2

10.1002/widm.1312,Causability and explainability of artificial intelligence in medicine,"Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black‐box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use‐case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system",2019.0,2019-04-02 00:00:00,1002,91,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e80e4b2f2a09bdbc20c63af5d85e6fc333746a0

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder‐Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.

10.1155/2015/374391,A Machine Learning System for Routing Decision-Making in Urban Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks,"In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), network topology and communication links frequently change due to the high mobility of vehicles. Key challenges include how to shorten transmission delays and increase the stability of transmissions. When establishing routing paths, most research focuses on detecting traffic and selecting roads with higher vehicle densities in order to transmit packets, thus avoiding carry-and-forward scenarios and decreasing transmission delays; however, such approaches may not obtain accurate real-time traffic densities by periodically monitoring each road because vehicle densities change so rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel routing information system called the machine learning-assisted route selection (MARS) system to estimate necessary information for routing protocols. In MARS, road information is maintained in roadside units with the help of machine learning. We use machine learning to predict the moves of vehicles and then choose some suitable routing paths with better transmission capacity to transmit packets.

10.3389/fpsyt.2021.726038,Differences of Sleep Disorders Between Vestibular Migraine and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,"Introduction: Sleep disorders can affect the overall health and quality of life of patients. This study was conducted to compare the differences of sleep disorders in vestibular migraine (VM) patients and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patients. Methods: VM patients, BPPV patients, and healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Pittsburgh sleep quality index and polysomnography monitoring were used as subjective and objective, respectively, evaluation methods to evaluate the sleep quality of participants in the latest month. Results: Fifty-seven BPPV patients, 48 VM patients, and 42 HCs were included in this study. There were 79.16% VM patients, 54.39% BPPV patients, and 14.28% HCs with sleep disorders. The difference in the incidence rate of sleep disorders was significant between VM patients and BPPV patients (p = 0.008) and significantly higher in both the VM group (p < 0.00001) and BPPV group (p = 0.00004) than in the HC groups (14.28%). Compared with BPPV patients, the VM patients had the significantly lower sleep efficiency (p < 0.001) and N3 (p < 0.001) and the significantly higher time of wake-up after sleep onset (p < 0.001), N1 (p < 0.001), and N2 (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the VM patients had significantly higher incidence rates of severe obstructive sleep apnea hypoventilation syndrome (p = 0.001) and periodic leg movement in sleep (p = 0.016). Conclusion: The incidence rate of sleep disorders was significantly higher in both VM and BPPV patients than in the HC groups. To improve the curative effects, clinicians should pay more attention to the comorbidity of sleep disorders in treating VM and BPPV.",2021.0,2021-11-18 00:00:00,13,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a4edf0c77f3c41910a8269abaa805a517cfc5b6

10.3389/fneur.2021.681140,Using Base-ml to Learn Classification of Common Vestibular Disorders on DizzyReg Registry Data,"Background: Multivariable analyses (MVA) and machine learning (ML) applied on large datasets may have a high potential to provide clinical decision support in neuro-otology and reveal further avenues for vestibular research. To this end, we build base-ml, a comprehensive MVA/ML software tool, and applied it to three increasingly difficult clinical objectives in differentiation of common vestibular disorders, using data from a large prospective clinical patient registry (DizzyReg). Methods: Base-ml features a full MVA/ML pipeline for classification of multimodal patient data, comprising tools for data loading and pre-processing; a stringent scheme for nested and stratified cross-validation including hyper-parameter optimization; a set of 11 classifiers, ranging from commonly used algorithms like logistic regression and random forests, to artificial neural network models, including a graph-based deep learning model which we recently proposed; a multi-faceted evaluation of classification metrics; tools from the domain of “Explainable AI” that illustrate the input distribution and a statistical analysis of the most important features identified by multiple classifiers. Results: In the first clinical task, classification of the bilateral vestibular failure (N = 66) vs. functional dizziness (N = 346) was possible with a classification accuracy ranging up to 92.5% (Random Forest). In the second task, primary functional dizziness (N = 151) vs. secondary functional dizziness (following an organic vestibular syndrome) (N = 204), was classifiable with an accuracy ranging from 56.5 to 64.2% (k-nearest neighbors/logistic regression). The third task compared four episodic disorders, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (N = 134), vestibular paroxysmia (N = 49), Menière disease (N = 142) and vestibular migraine (N = 215). Classification accuracy ranged between 25.9 and 50.4% (Naïve Bayes/Support Vector Machine). Recent (graph-) deep learning models classified well in all three tasks, but not significantly better than more traditional ML methods. Classifiers reliably identified clinically relevant features as most important toward classification. Conclusion: The three clinical tasks yielded classification results that correlate with the clinical intuition regarding the difficulty of diagnosis. It is favorable to apply an array of MVA/ML algorithms rather than a single one, to avoid under-estimation of classification accuracy. Base-ml provides a systematic benchmarking of classifiers, with a standardized output of MVA/ML performance on clinical tasks. To alleviate re-implementation efforts, we provide base-ml as an open-source tool for the community.",2021.0,2021-08-02 00:00:00,8,70,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e761c938b3c437f756ea72d4e168fbb02d996a32

Intrinsic variability between cells, caused by manufacturing differences, occurs at all stages of life and increases with age. Researchers need to know the minimum number of cells they should test to give an accurate representation of population variability, since testing many cells is expensive. In this paper, empirical capacity versus time ageing models were fitted to various degradation datasets assuming that the model parameters could be drawn from a distribution describing a larger population. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we estimated the number of cells required to be tested. Depending on the complexity of the ageing model, models with 1, 2 or 3 parameters respectively required data from at least 9, 11 or 13 cells for a consistent fit. This implies that researchers will need to test at least these numbers of cells at each test point in their experiment to capture manufacturing variability.",2021.0,2021-07-04 00:00:00,21,45,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55213a9c5f4dbef56aea6c2c16033d4a1c148209

10.1136/injuryprev-2019-043534,"How does mode of travel affect risks posed to other road users? An analysis of English road fatality data, incorporating gender and road type","Background Most analysis of road injuries examines the risk experienced by people using different modes of transport, for instance, pedestrian fatalities per-head or per-km. A small but growing field analyses the impact that the use of different transport modes has on other road users, for instance, injuries to others per-km driven. Methods This paper moves the analysis of risk posed to others forward by comparing six different vehicular modes, separating road types (major vs minor roads in urban vs rural settings). The comparison of risk posed by men and women for all these modes is also novel. Results Per-vehicle kilometre, buses and lorries pose much the highest risk to others, while cycles pose the lowest. Motorcycles pose a substantially higher per-km risk to others than cars. The fatality risk posed by cars or vans to ORUs per km is higher in rural areas. Risk posed is generally higher on major roads, although not in the case of lorries, suggesting a link to higher speeds. Men pose higher per-km risk to others than women for all modes except buses, as well as being over-represented among users of the most dangerous vehicles. Conclusions Future research should examine more settings, adjust for spatial and temporal confounders, or examine how infrastructure or route characteristics affect risk posed to others. Although for most victims the other vehicle involved is a car, results suggest policy-makers should also seek to reduce disproportionate risks posed by the more dangerous vehicles, for instance, by discouraging motorcycling. Finally, given higher risk posed to others by men across five of six modes analysed, policy-makers should consider how to reduce persistent large gender imbalances in jobs involving driving.",2020.0,2020-03-30 00:00:00,20,19,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4161b85c3cf794a3562319e11dac607d02dc8c58

By analyzing the synergies between gender inequality (as a problem), and lack of sustainability (another problem), there is a potential to create an understanding of how these problems are linked. Our aim is to better understand how gendered norms find expression in transport policy and planning. Taking a starting point in gender studies we advance four ideal types on masculine and feminine norms and relate them to sustainability in transport. We advance a methodology for studying gender norms in relation to sustainability in terms of how they are expressed in the text. We contribute to a deeper understanding of transportation related to men and masculinity studies, and advance work by masculinity scholars to include sustainability in transportation issues. Through text analysis, we demonstrate empirically how four Swedish municipalities have developed their (sustainable) transport policies 2014–2018. Our results indicate that the level of sustainability, in plans and strategies, are related to the presence of diverse masculine and feminine norms rather than male and female bodies.",2020.0,2020-01-30 00:00:00,16,63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a304bc7a507a8b64023d15031a30e6110185742b

10.1101/709147,RootNav 2.0: Deep learning for automatic navigation of complex plant root architectures,"We present a new image analysis approach that provides fully-automatic extraction of complex root system architectures from a range of plant species in varied imaging setups. Driven by modern deep-learning approaches, RootNav 2.0 replaces previously manual and semi-automatic feature extraction with an extremely deep multi-task Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The network has been designed to explicitly combine local pixel information with global scene information in order to accurately segment small root features across high-resolution images. In addition, the network simultaneously locates seeds, and first and second order root tips to drive a search algorithm seeking optimal paths throughout the image, extracting accurate architectures without user interaction. The proposed method is evaluated on images of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from a seedling assay. The results are compared with semi-automatic analysis via the original RootNav tool, demonstrating comparable accuracy, with a 10-fold increase in speed. We then demonstrate the ability of the network to adapt to different plant species via transfer learning, offering similar accuracy when transferred to an Arabidopsis thaliana plate assay. We transfer for a final time to images of Brassica napus from a hydroponic assay, and still demonstrate good accuracy despite many fewer training images. The tool outputs root architectures in the widely accepted RSML standard, for which numerous analysis packages exist (http://rootsystemml.github.io/), as well as segmentation masks compatible with other automated measurement tools.",2019.0,2019-07-20 00:00:00,95,61,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/311e41cc669a49802275f72e5b49f4c524b15a81

10.3390/a17040150,Solar Irradiance Forecasting with Natural Language Processing of Cloud Observations and Interpretation of Results with Modified Shapley Additive Explanations,"Forecasting the generation of solar power plants (SPPs) requires taking into account meteorological parameters that influence the difference between the solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere calculated with high accuracy and the solar irradiance at the tilted plane of the solar panel on the Earth’s surface. One of the key factors is cloudiness, which can be presented not only as a percentage of the sky area covered by clouds but also many additional parameters, such as the type of clouds, the distribution of clouds across atmospheric layers, and their height. The use of machine learning algorithms to forecast the generation of solar power plants requires retrospective data over a long period and formalising the features; however, retrospective data with detailed information about cloudiness are normally recorded in the natural language format. This paper proposes an algorithm for processing such records to convert them into a binary feature vector. Experiments conducted on data from a real solar power plant showed that this algorithm increases the accuracy of short-term solar irradiance forecasts by 5–15%, depending on the quality metric used. At the same time, adding features makes the model less transparent to the user, which is a significant drawback from the point of view of explainable artificial intelligence. Therefore, the paper uses an additive explanation algorithm based on the Shapley vector to interpret the model’s output. It is shown that this approach allows the machine learning model to explain why it generates a particular forecast, which will provide a greater level of trust in intelligent information systems in the power industry.",2024.0,2024-04-02 00:00:00,6,31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b814128527051f29a7b6108ff4f82f6fec762cf

Therefore, it is necessary to develop and improve methods for forecasting of the power plants generation using the energy of the sun, wind and water flows. One of the ways to improve the accuracy of forecast models is a deep analysis of meteorological conditions as the main factor affecting the power generation. In this paper, a method for adapting of forecast models to the meteorological conditions of photovoltaic stations operation based on machine learning algorithms was proposed and studied. In this case, unsupervised learning is first performed using the k-means method to form clusters. For this, it is also proposed to use studied the feature space dimensionality reduction algorithm to visualize and estimate the clustering accuracy. Then, for each cluster, its own machine learning model was trained for generation forecasting and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm was built to attribute the current conditions at the model operation stage to one of the formed clusters. The study was conducted on hourly meteorological data for the period from 1985 to 2021. A feature of the approach is the clustering of weather conditions on hourly rather than daily intervals. As a result, the mean absolute percentage error of forecasting is reduced significantly, depending on the prediction model used. For the best case, the error in forecasting of a photovoltaic plant generation an hour ahead was 9 %.",2023.0,2023-08-08 00:00:00,9,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66b404da17d795583f0caf1d435b0bfd37470abf

One such requirement is the installed capacity utilization factor, which is extremely important for optimally placing power facilities based on renewable energy sources and for the successful development of renewable energy. Efficient placement maximizes the installed capacity utilization factor of a power facility, increasing energy efficiency and the payback period. The installed capacity utilization factor depends on the assumed meteorological factors relating to geographical location and the technical characteristics of power generation. However, the installed capacity utilization factor cannot be accurately predicted, since it is necessary to know the volume of electricity produced by the power facility. A novel approach to the optimization of placement of renewable energy source power plants and their capacity factor forecasting was proposed in this article. This approach combines a machine learning forecasting algorithm (random forest regressor) with a metaheuristic optimization algorithm (grey wolf optimizer). Although the proposed approach assumes the use of only open-source data, the simulations show better results than commonly used algorithms, such as random search, particle swarm optimizer, and firefly algorithm.",2023.0,2023-06-01 00:00:00,5,44,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/525683dd0168c15d4d4b8252bd46c86f15fc5bb3

10.3390/math10060999,A Modified Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm for an Intrusion Detection System,"Cyber-attacks and unauthorized application usage have increased due to the extensive use of Internet services and applications over computer networks, posing a threat to the service’s availability and consumers’ privacy. A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect aberrant traffic behavior that firewalls cannot detect. In IDSs, dimension reduction using the feature selection strategy has been shown to be more efficient. By reducing the data dimension and eliminating irrelevant and noisy data, several bio-inspired algorithms have been employed to improve the performance of an IDS. This paper discusses a modified bio-inspired algorithm, which is the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), that enhances the efficacy of the IDS in detecting both normal and anomalous traffic in the network. The main improvements cover the smart initialization phase that combines the filter and wrapper approaches to ensure that the informative features will be included in early iterations. In addition, we adopted a high-speed classification method, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and used the modified GWO to tune the ELM’s parameters. The proposed technique was tested against various meta-heuristic algorithms using the UNSWNB-15 dataset. Because the generic attack is the most common attack type in the dataset, the primary goal of this paper was to detect generic attacks in network traffic. The proposed model outperformed other methods in minimizing the crossover error rate and false positive rate to less than 30%.

10.1136/bmjhci-2022-100731,A natural language processing approach to categorise contributing factors from patient safety event reports,"Objectives The objective of this study was to explore the use of natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to categorise contributing factors from patient safety event (PSE). Contributing factors are elements in the healthcare process (eg, communication failures) that instigate an event or allow an event to occur. Contributing factors can be used to further investigate why safety events occurred. Methods We used 10 years of self-reported PSE reports from a multihospital healthcare system in the USA. Reports were first selected by event date. We calculated χ2 values for each ngram in the bag-of-words then selected N ngrams with the highest χ2 values. Then, PSE reports were filtered to only include the sentences containing the selected ngrams. Such sentences were called information-rich sentences. We compared two feature extraction techniques from free-text data: (1) baseline bag-of-words features and (2) features from information-rich sentences. Three machine learning algorithms were used to categorise five contributing factors representing sociotechnical errors: communication/hand-off failure, technology issue, policy/procedure issue, distractions/interruptions and lapse/slip. We trained 15 binary classifiers (five contributing factors * three machine learning models). The models’ performances were evaluated according to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), precision, recall, and F1-score. Results Applying the information-rich sentence selection algorithm boosted the contributing factor categorisation performance. Comparing the AUPRCs, the proposed NLP approach improved the categorisation performance of two and achieved comparable results with baseline in categorising three contributing factors. Conclusions Information-rich sentence selection can be incorporated to extract the sentences in free-text event narratives in which the contributing factor information is embedded.",2023.0,2023-05-01 00:00:00,7,41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78413cd47d26820d3e41abcd5e39ef50933c4ee6

10.2196/43014,Extracting Medical Information From Free-Text and Unstructured Patient-Generated Health Data Using Natural Language Processing Methods: Feasibility Study With Real-world Data,"Background Patient-generated health data (PGHD) captured via smart devices or digital health technologies can reflect an individual health journey. PGHD enables tracking and monitoring of personal health conditions, symptoms, and medications out of the clinic, which is crucial for self-care and shared clinical decisions. In addition to self-reported measures and structured PGHD (eg, self-screening, sensor-based biometric data), free-text and unstructured PGHD (eg, patient care note, medical diary) can provide a broader view of a patient’s journey and health condition. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process and analyze unstructured data to create meaningful summaries and insights, showing promise to improve the utilization of PGHD. Objective Our aim is to understand and demonstrate the feasibility of an NLP pipeline to extract medication and symptom information from real-world patient and caregiver data. Methods We report a secondary data analysis, using a data set collected from 24 parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who were recruited via a nonrandom sampling approach. Participants used a voice-interactive app for 2 weeks, generating free-text patient notes (audio transcription or text entry). We built an NLP pipeline using a zero-shot approach (adaptive to low-resource settings). We used named entity recognition (NER) and medical ontologies (RXNorm and SNOMED CT [Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms]) to identify medication and symptoms. Sentence-level dependency parse trees and part-of-speech tags were used to extract additional entity information using the syntactic properties of a note. We assessed the data; evaluated the pipeline with the patient notes; and reported the precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results In total, 87 patient notes are included (audio transcriptions n=78 and text entries n=9) from 24 parents who have at least one CSHCN. The participants were between the ages of 26 and 59 years. The majority were White (n=22, 92%), had more than one child (n=16, 67%), lived in Ohio (n=22, 92%), had mid- or upper-mid household income (n=15, 62.5%), and had higher level education (n=24, 58%). Out of 87 notes, 30 were drug and medication related, and 46 were symptom related. We captured medication instances (medication, unit, quantity, and date) and symptoms satisfactorily (precision >0.65, recall >0.77, F1>0.72). These results indicate the potential when using NER and dependency parsing through an NLP pipeline on information extraction from unstructured PGHD. Conclusions The proposed NLP pipeline was found to be feasible for use with real-world unstructured PGHD to accomplish medication and symptom extraction. Unstructured PGHD can be leveraged to inform clinical decision-making, remote monitoring, and self-care including medical adherence and chronic disease management. With customizable information extraction methods using NER and medical ontologies, NLP models can feasibly extract a broad range of clinical information from unstructured PGHD in low-resource settings (eg, a limited number of patient notes or training data).",2022.0,2022-09-27 00:00:00,23,52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0e262c94a0415fda724aa91d6f60c627ddd0519

In the 2019 update, WebGestalt supports 12 organisms, 342 gene identifiers and 155 175 functional categories, as well as user-uploaded functional databases. To address the growing and unique need for phosphoproteomics data interpretation, we have implemented phosphosite set analysis to identify important kinases from phosphoproteomics data. We have completely redesigned result visualizations and user interfaces to improve user-friendliness and to provide multiple types of interactive and publication-ready figures. To facilitate comprehension of the enrichment results, we have implemented two methods to reduce redundancy between enriched gene sets. We introduced a web API for other applications to get data programmatically from the WebGestalt server or pass data to WebGestalt for analysis. We also wrapped the core computation into an R package called WebGestaltR for users to perform analysis locally or in third party workflows.

10.3390/app10031042,Analyzing and Predicting Students’ Performance by Means of Machine Learning: A Review,"Predicting students’ performance is one of the most important topics for learning contexts such as schools and universities, since it helps to design effective mechanisms that improve academic results and avoid dropout, among other things. These are benefited by the automation of many processes involved in usual students’ activities which handle massive volumes of data collected from software tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, analyzing and processing these data carefully can give us useful information about the students’ knowledge and the relationship between them and the academic tasks. This information is the source that feeds promising algorithms and methods able to predict students’ performance. In this study, almost 70 papers were analyzed to show different modern techniques widely applied for predicting students’ performance, together with the objectives they must reach in this field. These techniques and methods, which pertain to the area of Artificial Intelligence, are mainly Machine Learning, Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Neural Networks, among others.",2020.0,2020-02-04 00:00:00,228,68,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db067d2912fe8b8350082df2f96125a1c1e8dd87
10.3390/SU11102833,Application of Machine Learning in Predicting Performance for Computer Engineering Students: A Case Study,"The present work proposes the application of machine learning techniques to predict the final grades (FGs) of students based on their historical performance of grades. The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university’s strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching–learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching–learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student’s performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students.",2019.0,2019-05-17 00:00:00,99,35,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c0d8c7b571530613aae37dc863b9ed34c13e95b

10.1371/journal.pgen.1007206,Deep sequencing of HBV pre-S region reveals high heterogeneity of HBV genotypes and associations of word pattern frequencies with HCC,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common problem in the world, especially in China. More than 60–80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases can be attributed to HBV infection in high HBV prevalent regions. Although traditional Sanger sequencing has been extensively used to investigate HBV sequences, NGS is becoming more commonly used. Further, it is unknown whether word pattern frequencies of HBV reads by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used to investigate HBV genotypes and predict HCC status. In this study, we used NGS to sequence the pre-S region of the HBV sequence of 94 HCC patients and 45 chronic HBV (CHB) infected individuals. Word pattern frequencies among the sequence data of all individuals were calculated and compared using the Manhattan distance. The individuals were grouped using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Word pattern frequencies were also used to build prediction models for HCC status using both K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). We showed the extremely high power of analyzing HBV sequences using word patterns. Our key findings include that the first principal coordinate of the PCoA analysis was highly associated with the fraction of genotype B (or C) sequences and the second principal coordinate was significantly associated with the probability of having HCC. Hierarchical clustering first groups the individuals according to their major genotypes followed by their HCC status. Using cross-validation, high area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) of around 0.88 for KNN and 0.92 for SVM were obtained. In the independent data set of 46 HCC patients and 31 CHB individuals, a good AUC score of 0.77 was obtained using SVM. It was further shown that 3000 reads for each individual can yield stable prediction results for SVM. Thus, another key finding is that word patterns can be used to predict HCC status with high accuracy. Therefore, our study shows clearly that word pattern frequencies of HBV sequences contain much information about the composition of different HBV genotypes and the HCC status of an individual.",2018.0,2018-02-01 00:00:00,14,55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/faf9b16129a022d4db4380b2a4bda6064179b0f3

10.1002/hep.27969,World‐wide relative contribution of hepatitis B and C viruses in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In order to assess the relative contribution of HBV and HCV to HCC worldwide, and identify changes over time, we conducted a systematic review of case series published up to the year 2014. Eligible studies had to report seroprevalence of both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti‐HCV), alone and in combination, for at least 20 adult HCC cases. Studies using a first‐generation enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay test for HCV were excluded. A total of 119,000 HCC cases in 260 studies were included from 50 countries. Most European and American countries show a preponderance of HCV over HBV and a substantial fraction of viral marker–negative cases. Asian and African countries generally show a predominance of HBV. The fraction of HCV‐positive HCC cases is substantial in Taiwan, Mongolia, Japan, and Pakistan as well as in Western‐Central Asia and Northern Africa. No eligible studies were available in Oceania, large parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. The United States, Brazil, and Germany show evidence of higher prevalence of HCV in HCC since the year 2000. Conversely, Japan and Italy show a decline in the proportion of HCV‐positive HCC. Conclusion: HBV and HCV are predominant causes of HCC in virtually all world areas, with a growing fraction of HCC cases in several countries attributable to HCV.

10.4103/ams.ams_167_23,Uncommon Posterior Disc Displacement of Temporomandibular Joint - A Case Report,"Abstract Rationale: Posterior disc displacement (PDD) is an uncommon condition in which disc tissue is located between the posterior surface of the condyle and post-glenoid tubercle. The etiopathogenesis of this condition is idiopathic. There are different predisposing factors in the literature which are consistent with the presented case such as lack of anterior prominence of the disc, thinning of the posterior zone of the disc and perforation of the disc. Patient Concerns: We report an uncommon temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthropathy case of a 33-year-old female patient, who presented with long-standing TMJ pain associated with limited mouth opening. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with non-reducible PDD of TMJ bilaterally. Treatment: Open surgery of TMJ (Discopexy) was the choice of treatment to release and mobilise discs. Outcomes: A noticeable increase in mouth opening without pain in TMJ area was achieved immediately after surgery and remained stable during periodic follow-ups. Take-away Lessons: The importance of magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool for arthropathy, to determine the proper management is essential. Moreover, the root of the helix inter tragus notch incision presents an advantage of open surgery of TMJ which results in immediate outcome with limited complications.",2024.0,2024-03-20 00:00:00,1,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0efe46b3f586273b9b8e31ddb91a3ba0d0edf5f5

The present study investigated the effects of ultrasonic excitation on the heat transfer rate in a fin-and-flat tube heat exchanger experimentally. The performance of the heat exchanger was investigated with and without the presence of ultrasonic excitation. A comprehensive parameter study was attempted, so several parameters, including ambient temperature, flow rate, air passing velocity, Reynolds number, and Nusselt number, were studied in a relatively wide range. An adequate uncertainty test, as well as a validation assessment, is provided to certify the credibility of the obtained results and the hired facility. The results revealed that reducing the flow rate, ambient temperature, and air passing velocity on the heat exchanger increased the ultrasonic excitation’s effects. The highest heat transfer enhancement in the present experiment was 70.11%, measured at the lowest air passing velocity and ambient temperature with a Reynolds number 2166. The data presented in this paper will be useful for the optimal design of ultrasonic vibrating fin-and-tube heat exchangers.",2022.0,2022-12-31 00:00:00,40,28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/508dbb3f071fdd1a305dea3b6cf357762d0d71fd

However, almost all additively manufactured parts must be post-processed in order to fulfil geometric tolerances, surface quality demands and the desired functional properties. Thus, additive manufacturing actually means the implementation of additive-subtractive process chains. Starting with the most relevant additive processes (powder-based PBF-LB, LMD-p and wire-based WAAM and LMD-w/WLAM), considering intermediate process steps (heat treatment and shot peening) and ending up with post-processing material removal processes (with defined and undefined cutting edges), this paper gives an overview of recent research findings with respect to a comprehensive scientific investigation of influences and interactions within the additive-subtractive process chain.

10.1108/frep-06-2023-0022,"Comparing the Harrod-Domar, Solow and Ramsey growth models and their implications for economic policies","PurposeThe principal aim of this paper is to review three basic theoretical growth models, namely the Harrod-Domar model, the Solow model and the Ramsey model, and examine their implications for economic policies.Design/methodology/approachThe paper utilizes a positivist research framework that emphasizes the causal relationships between the variables in each of the three models. Mathematical methods are employed to formulate and examine the three models under study. Since the paper is theoretical, it does not use any empirical data although numerical illustrations are provided whenever they are appropriate.FindingsThe Harrod-Domar model explains why countries with high rates of saving may also enjoy high rate of economic growth. Both the Solow and Ramsey models can be used to explain the medium-income trap. The paper examines the impact of Covid shocks on the macroeconomy. While the growth rate can be recovered, it may not always possible to recover the output level.Research limitations/implicationsFor the Harrod-Domar model, the public spending decreases the private consumption at the period 1, but there is no change in the capital stock and hence the production in subsequent periods. For the Ramsey model with AK production function, both the private consumption and the outputs will be lowered. In both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function, if the debt is not high and the interest rate is sufficiently low, it is better to use public debt for production rather than for consumption. If the country borrows to recover the Total Factor Productivity after the Covid pandemic, both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function show that the rate of growth is higher for the year just after the pandemic but is the same as before the pandemic.Practical implicationsThe economy can recover the growth rate after a Covid shock, but the recovery process will generally take many periods.Social implicationsThis paper focuses on economic implications and does not aim to examine social implications of policy changes or Covid-type shock.Originality/valueThe paper provides a comparison of three basic growth models with respect to public spending, public debts and repayments and Covid-type shocks.",2023.0,2023-10-10 00:00:00,3,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2d8fe7e57ad46ac46fdd8fc873fe13523e308d5

10.21037/JGO-2020-01,New insights in the pathology of peritoneal surface malignancy.,"Pathology is central to the management of peritoneal surface malignancy. This article highlights some recent advances that have had an impact on patient management or could do so in the near future. Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, particularly the epithelioid subtype, is amenable to radical therapy in selected cases, and factors such as ki67 proliferation index, expression of BAP1 and mutation in CDKN2A show promise as prognostic indicators. Our understanding of multicystic mesothelioma has improved in recent years; it is a true neoplasm for which surgery may be indicated. Serous carcinomas involving the peritoneum are now known to originate from tubal epithelium. They are of two distinct types, high grade and low grade, which are now recognized as different neoplasms with distinctive features, oncogenesis and behavior. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is an unusual condition that usually arises from an appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Recent consensus in the classification and nomenclature of these lesions is discussed, including the distinction between low grade and high grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (HAMN), and the diagnostic criteria for appendiceal adenocarcinoma. PMP is divided into four prognostic groups: acellular mucin, low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, and high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei with signet ring cells. The pseudomyxoma microbiome is a promising area for clinical intervention but has been the subject of little research activity. Goblet cell adenocarcinoma (previously known as 'goblet cell carcinoid') is a distinctive type of appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Its behavior correlates with histologic features, but no general consensus for classification has been reached.",2021.0,2021-04-01 00:00:00,12,131,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/83a400c08f9fe568b9c6b96d6711e10e4c24c73b

We considered the covid pandemic a black swan event that had caused ambiguity. A significant factor that has increased the probability of bankruptcy in recent times has been the large-scale supply chain disruptions and crippling lockdowns. Firms are trying to get back to pre-Covid utilization of plant capacity or pivot their business models differently to seize newer opportunities amidst the crisis. We considered the change in operating expenditure (primarily decrease) as our proxy for uncertainty as firms were forced to cut down majorly on their operations and thus incurred lesser variable costs. In an economy showing inflationary trends, the operating expenses will generally increase. But we found that the operational costs had shown a dip in the case of many of the firms during FY 20–21, and we attributed it to Covid disruptions. Results show that Machine Learning Techniques are better than Logistic Regression in predicting the bankruptcy of firms and that the same predictive power of ascertaining bankruptcy improves when a proxy for uncertainty is added to the model.",2023.0,2023-05-10 00:00:00,6,43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6ea8891c9d8654ce47d2da90e558aafd14d14dbb

10.3389/fpsyg.2020.580820,Challenges and Future Directions of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Education,"We discuss the new challenges and directions facing the use of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) in education research, policy-making, and industry. In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.",2020.0,2020-10-19 00:00:00,285,122,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9198d6ab8ad1c6f1527a7d4adf06809848bf23c7

10.3390/rs14122830,Multi-Scenario Simulation of Production-Living-Ecological Space in the Poyang Lake Area Based on Remote Sensing and RF-Markov-FLUS Model,"With industrialization and urbanization, the competition among land production, living, and ecological (PLE) spaces has intensified. Particularly in ecological reserves, competition among various types of land use restricts the coordinated development of PLE space. To explore spatial sustainable development, this study starts from a PLE spatial perspective, based on Landsat long time series images. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) and landscape index analysis were selected to monitor the spatial and temporal land use and landscape pattern changes in the Poyang Lake region (PYL region) from 1989 to 2020. The RF-Markov-FLUS coupled model was used to simulate spatial changes in 2030 under four scenarios: production space priority (PSP), living space priority (LSP), ecological space priority (ESP), and an integrated development (ID). Finally, the goal-problem-principle was used to enhance PLE space. The results showed that: (1) production space and ecological spaces decreased in general from 1989 to 2020 by 3% and 7%, respectively; living space increased by 11%. (2) From 1989 to 2020, the overall landscape spread in the Poyang Lake (PYL) area decreased, connectivity decreased, fragmentation increased, landscape heterogeneity increased, and landscape geometry became more irregular. (3) Compared with the other three scenarios, the ID scenario maintained steady production space growth in 2030, the expansion rate of living space slowed, and the area of ecological space decreased the least. (4) Spatial pattern optimization should start with three aspects: the transformation of the agricultural industry, improving the efficiency of urban land use, and establishing communities of “mountains, water, forests, fields, lakes and grasses”. The results provide scientific planning and suggestions for the future ecological protection of Poyang Lake area with multiple scenarios and perspectives.",2022.0,2022-06-13 00:00:00,27,65,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07bb4f486511077425d10fd85dae42b5925144d3

10.3390/W13111539,Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Water Body Changes and Their Influencing Factors in the Seasonal Lakes of the Poyang Lake Region,"Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, an internationally important wetland and the largest migratory bird habitat in Asia. There are numerous seasonal lakes in the Poyang Lake region, and these lakes create a complex and diverse wetland landscape and serve as the main activity area for migratory birds. Seasonal lakes have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes, but research on seasonal lakes is relatively limited. Based on long-term remote sensing images, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of seasonal lakes and their influencing factors and ecological effects. The conclusions were as follows: the average water area of seasonal lakes showed a unimodal change during the year, reaching a maximum in July and a minimum in January. The interannual water area fluctuated greatly, and the overall water area showed a small downward trend. In terms of spatial variation, the seasonal lakes were connected with the main lake in the wet season and separated from the main lake in the dry season. Among the natural factors, the influences of temperature, evaporation, and rainfall on the water area of the seasonal lakes were successively reduced. In addition, the incoming water from the Yangtze River had an important influence. Among the human factors, the traditional fishing method “enclosing sublakes in autumn” had the greatest impact on the water area in a specific period, followed by the indirect impact of the Three Gorges Project.",2021.0,2021-05-30 00:00:00,13,46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1d94bf2d8b998ceae98291cdcd480552c80b994

This paper analyzes changes in cultivated land, the driving factors that cause them, and their tremendous impact on landscape pattern changes in the Dongting Lake Basin. For this purpose, we used mathematical statistics, buffer analysis, trend analysis, landscape pattern index, and logistic regression model to analyze the land use data of the study area from 1980 to 2018. The results show that the cultivated land showed a decreasing trend, with the total area decreased by 4.76% (or 716.13 km2) from 1980 to 2018, and the activity of mutual transformation with other land use types decreased. The spatial distribution pattern of cultivated land and landscape shows the change characteristics gradually from Dongting Lake to the surroundings. Among the driving factors of cultivated land changes, the influence of human activities was gradually increasing, while the natural factors were decreasing. The cultivated land landscape pattern index and the overall landscape pattern index have a significant positive correlation, showing relatively consistent change trend and spatial distribution characteristics. We believe that the decrease of cultivated land area has a certain relationship with the increase of landscape fragmentation in the Dongting Lake Basin.

10.3389/fendo.2023.1163046,Integrating single-cell analysis and machine learning to create glycosylation-based gene signature for prognostic prediction of uveal melanoma,"Background Increasing evidence suggests a correlation between glycosylation and the onset of cancer. However, the clinical relevance of glycosylation-related genes (GRGs) in uveal melanoma (UM) is yet to be fully understood. This study aimed to shed light on the impact of GRGs on UM prognosis. Methods To identify the most influential genes in UM, we employed the AUCell and WGCNA algorithms. The GRGs signature was established by integrating bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. UM patients were separated into two groups based on their risk scores, the GCNS_low and GCNS_high groups, and the differences in clinicopathological correlation, functional enrichment, immune response, mutational burden, and immunotherapy between the two groups were examined. The role of the critical gene AUP1 in UM was validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The GRGs signature was comprised of AUP1, HNMT, PARP8, ARC, ALG5, AKAP13, and ISG20. The GCNS was a significant prognostic factor for UM, and high GCNS correlated with poorer outcomes. Patients with high GCNS displayed heightened immune-related characteristics, such as immune cell infiltration and immune scores. In vitro experiments showed that the knockdown of AUP1 led to a drastic reduction in the viability, proliferation, and invasion capability of UM cells. Conclusion Our gene signature provides an independent predictor of UM patient survival and represents a starting point for further investigation of GRGs in UM. It offers a novel perspective on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of UM.",2023.0,2023-03-23 00:00:00,40,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a015a1f1b2a2acfc4547f6f5fce1b65a57b4d8a3
10.3389/fimmu.2023.1091218,"Circadian rhythm-related genes index: A predictor for HNSCC prognosis, immunotherapy efficacy, and chemosensitivity","Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common head and neck cancer and is highly aggressive and heterogeneous, leading to variable prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes. Circadian rhythm alterations in tumourigenesis are of equal importance to genetic factors and several biologic clock genes are considered to be prognostic biomarkers for various cancers. The aim of this study was to establish reliable markers based on biologic clock genes, thus providing a new perspective for assessing immunotherapy response and prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Methods We used 502 HNSCC samples and 44 normal samples from the TCGA-HNSCC dataset as the training set. 97 samples from GSE41613 were used as an external validation set. Prognostic characteristics of circadian rhythm-related genes (CRRGs) were established by Lasso, random forest and stepwise multifactorial Cox. Multivariate analysis revealed that CRRGs characteristics were independent predictors of HNSCC, with patients in the high-risk group having a worse prognosis than those in the low-risk group. The relevance of CRRGs to the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy was assessed by an integrated algorithm. Results 6-CRRGs were considered to be strongly associated with HNSCC prognosis and a good predictor of HNSCC. The riskscore established by the 6-CRRG was found to be an independent prognostic factor for HNSCC in multifactorial analysis, with patients in the low-risk group having a higher overall survival (OS) than the high-risk group. Nomogram prediction maps constructed from clinical characteristics and riskscore had good prognostic power. Patients in the low-risk group had higher levels of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint expression and were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusion 6-CRRGs play a key predictive role for the prognosis of HNSCC patients and can guide physicians in selecting potential responders to prioritise immunotherapy, which could facilitate further research in precision immuno-oncology.",2023.0,2023-03-10 00:00:00,55,87,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a219d3fa9537f2c44ef9735cc00f4bbede0d71b8

10.3390/en15176276,A Literature Review of the Challenges and Opportunities of the Transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0,"In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs.

However, given the complexity of learning analytics (LA) systems, it can be challenging to meaningfully involve non-technical stakeholders throughout their design and development. This article reports on the iterative co-design, development, and classroom evaluation of Konscia, a wearable, real-time awareness tool for teachers working in AI-enhanced K-12 classrooms. In the process, we argue that the co-design of LA systems requires new kinds of prototyping methods. We introduce one of our own prototyping methods, REs, to address unique challenges of co-prototyping LA tools. This work presents the first end-to-end demonstration of how non-technical stakeholders can participate throughout the whole design process for a complex LA system—from early generative phases to the selection and tuning of analytics to evaluation in real-world contexts. We conclude by providing methodological recommendations for future LA co-design efforts.

10.1002/psp4.12944,Computational design of clinical trials using a combination of simulation and the genetic algorithm,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has come to be used in various technological fields in recent years. However, there have been no reports of AI‐designed clinical trials. In this study, we tried to develop study designs by a genetic algorithm (GA), which is an AI solution for combination optimization problems. Specifically, the computational design approach was applied to optimize the blood sampling schedule for a bioequivalence (BE) study in pediatrics and optimize the allocation of dose groups for a dose‐finding study. The GA could reduce the number of blood collection points from 15 (typical standard) to seven points without meaningful impact on the accuracy and precision of the pharmacokinetic estimation for the pediatric BE study. For the dose‐finding study, up to 10% reduction of the total number of required subjects from the standard design could be achieved. The GA also created a design that would lead to a drastic reduction of the required number of subjects in the placebo arm while keeping the total number of subjects at a minimum level. These results indicated the potential usefulness of the computational clinical study design approach for innovative drug development.",2023.0,2023-02-15 00:00:00,2,50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3c28887e55f781aa31f131e510e9840bcafb176

10.30630/joiv.7.4.1608,Storychart: A Character Interaction Chart for Visualizing the Activities Flow,"Event-predicate-based storyline extraction results in a chronologically ordered activity journal. The extraction results contain complex human activities, so the activity journal requires a visualization model to describe actor interactions. This paper proposes a chart to visualize the activities' flow to describe the characters' interactions in an activity journal. This chart is called a storychart. Storycharts have an actor channel that can accept single entities or teams. The actor channel allows changing the type from single to a team or vice versa and moving members to other teams. The activity channel serves as a connector to accommodate interactions between actors. The activity channel provides a visual space for the elements of what, where, and when. Event predicates are the core of what. Therefore, the storychart visualizes the event predicate using glyphs to attract the reader’s attention. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a team channel that can visualize the identity of team members and an activity channel that can visualize the details of events. We invited participants to discover the reader’s perception of the ease of team recognition and the integrity of the meaning of the narrative visualized by the storychart. Participants involved in the evaluation were filtered by literacy score. Evaluation of storychart reading showed that readers could easily distinguish teams from single actors, and storycharts could convey the story in the activity journal with little reduction in meaning.",2023.0,2023-12-22 00:00:00,1,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cd16d62dedb9da5134aab2a38a400b7b49fbdb5
