202310.3390/en17040925,2023 Insights into Household Electric Vehicle Charging Behavior: Analysis and Predictive Modeling,"In the era of burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) popularity, understanding the patterns of EV users’ behavior is imperative. This paper examines the trends in household charging sessions’ timing, duration, and energy consumption by analyzing real-world residential charging data. By leveraging the information collected from each session, a novel framework is introduced for the efficient, real-time prediction of important charging characteristics. Utilizing historical data and user-specific features, machine learning models are trained to predict the connection duration, charging duration, charging demand, and time until the next session. These models enhance the understanding of EV users’ behavior and provide practical tools for optimizing the EV charging infrastructure and effectively managing the charging demand. As the transportation sector becomes increasingly electrified, this work aims to empower stakeholders with insights and reliable models, enabling them to anticipate the localized demand and contribute to the sustainable integration of electric vehicles into the grid.",2023,2024-02-16,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00000c33779acab142af6c7a6dae8b36fac0805d

202010.2196/41566,2020 Personalized Prediction of Response to Smartphone-Delivered Meditation Training: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background Meditation apps have surged in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals turning to these apps to cope with stress, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” (PAI) reflecting an individual’s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

202310.1002/anbr.202300085,2023 Machine Learning‐Based Prediction of Immunomodulatory Properties of Polymers: Toward a Faster and Easier Development of Anti‐Inflammatory Biomaterials,"In biomaterials development, creating materials with desirable properties can be a time‐consuming and resource‐intensive process, often relying on serendipitous discoveries. A potential route to accelerate this process is to employ artificial intelligence methodologies such as machine learning (ML). Herein, the possibility to predict anti‐inflammatory properties of the polymers by using a simplified model of inflammation and a restrained dataset is explored. Cellular assays with 50 different polymers are conducted using the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. These experiments generate a dataset which is used to develop a ML model based on Bayesian logistic regression. After conducting a Bayesian logistic regression analysis, two ML models, K‐nearest neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes, are employed to predict anti‐inflammatory polymers properties. The study finds that the probability of a polymer having anti‐inflammatory properties is multiplied by three if it is a polycation, and that nitric oxide secretion is a good indicator in determining the anti‐inflammatory properties of a polymer, which in this work are defined by tumor necrosis factor alpha expression decrease. Overall, the study suggests that with appropriate dataset design, ML techniques can provide valuable information on functional polymer properties, enabling faster and more efficient biomaterial development.",2023,2024-01-08,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00017dccee63f60b8af0acb7d08831b29bc4e3a6

202410.3389/fonc.2025.1531465,2024 The aggrephagy-related gene TUBA1B influences clinical outcomes in glioma patients by regulating the cell cycle,"Background Gliomas are common primary malignant brain tumors, with glioblastoma (GBM) being the most aggressive subtype. GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high TUBA1B expression is closely associated with glioma malignancy and poor prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target.",2024,2025-02-28,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d0ebfeb82a9c0fe964bd5ca0811f352883cf

202310.4103/jmss.jmss_47_23,2023 Radiomics based Machine Learning Models for Classification of Prostate Cancer Grade Groups from Multi Parametric MRI Images,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) radiomic feature-based machine learning (ML) models in classifying the Gleason grade group (GG) of prostate cancer. Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 203 patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI before prostate biopsy were included. After manual segmentation, radiomic features (RFs) were extracted from T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, and high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI). Patients were split into training sets and testing sets according to a ratio of 8:2. A pipeline considering combinations of two feature selection (FS) methods and six ML classifiers was developed and evaluated. The performance of models was assessed using the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1-measure, and the area under curve (AUC). Results: On high b-value DWMRI-derived features, a combination of FS method recursive feature elimination (RFE) and classifier random forest achieved the highest performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs, with 97.0% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity, 98.0% precision, and 97.0% F1-measure. The method also achieved an average AUC for GG of 98%. Conclusion: Preoperative mpMRI radiomic analysis based on ML, as a noninvasive approach, showed good performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs. Advances in Knowledge: Herein, radiomic models based on preoperative mpMRI and ML were developed to classify prostate cancer into 5 GGs. Our study provides evidence that analysis of quantitative RFs extracted from high b-value DWMRI images based on a combination of FS method RFE and classifier random forest can be applied for multiclass grading of prostate cancer with an accuracy of 97.0%.",2023,2024-12-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00026937c840c52bf8b75ff78140f386c0f172dc

Specifically, if common variants confer growth advantages, they may have undergone positive selection across different patients due to similar selection pressures. Moreover, studies have demonstrated the significance of rare mutations that arise as resistance mechanisms in response to drug treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of both recurrent and rare variants in cancer. In addition to this, most existing tools for variant prediction focus on distinguishing variants found in normal and disease populations, often without considering the specific disease contexts in which these variants arise. Instead, they typically build predictors that generalise across all diseases. Here, we introduce CanDrivR-CS, a set of cancer-specific gradient boosting models designed to distinguish between rare and recurrent cancer variants. Results We curated missense variant data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Cancer-type-specific models significantly outperformed a baseline pan-cancer model, achieving a maximum leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) F1 score of up to 90% for CanDrivRSKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma) and 89% for CanDrivR-SKCA (Skin Adenocarcinoma), compared to 79.2% for the baseline model. Notably, DNA shape properties consistently ranked among the top features for distinguishing recurrent and rare variants across all cancers. Specifically, recurrent missense variants frequently occurred in DNA bends and rolls, potentially implicating regions prone to DNA replication errors and acting as mutational hotspots.

201810.3390/s21175948,"2018 Early Detection of Aphid Infestation and Insect-Plant Interaction Assessment in Wheat Using a Low-Cost Electronic Nose (E-Nose), Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Machine Learning Modeling","Advances in early insect detection have been reported using digital technologies through camera systems, sensor networks, and remote sensing coupled with machine learning (ML) modeling. However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence).

Previous studies have targeted particular patient populations with life-limiting disease, but few have focused on patients in a primary care setting. Toward this end, we propose a stepped-wedge pragmatic randomized trial whereby a machine learning algorithm identifies patients empaneled to primary care units at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, United States) with high likelihood of palliative care need. Methods 42 care team units in 9 clusters were randomized to 7 wedges, each lasting 42 days. For care teams in treatment wedges, palliative care specialists review identified patients, making recommendations to primary care providers when appropriate. Care teams in control wedges receive palliative care under the standard of care.

High levels and complex patterns of spontaneous activity are generally associated with low rates of apoptosis in the cortex. However, whether spontaneous activity patterns directly encode for survival of individual cortical neurons during development remains an open question. Here, we longitudinally investigated spontaneous activity and apoptosis in developing cortical cultures, combining extracellular electrophysiology with calcium imaging. These experiments demonstrated that the early occurrence of calcium transients was strongly linked to neuronal survival. Silent neurons exhibited a higher probability of cell death, whereas high frequency spiking and burst behavior were almost exclusively detected in surviving neurons. In local neuronal clusters, activity of neighboring neurons exerted a pro-survival effect, whereas on the functional level, networks with a high modular topology were associated with lower cell death rates. Using machine learning algorithms, cell fate of individual neurons was predictable through the integration of spontaneous activity features.

202310.3390/agriculture14111900,2023 UAV-Based Multispectral Winter Wheat Growth Monitoring with Adaptive Weight Allocation,"Comprehensive growth index (CGI) more accurately reflects crop growth conditions than single indicators, which is crucial for precision irrigation, fertilization, and yield prediction. However, many current studies overlook the relationships between different growth parameters and their varying contributions to yield, leading to overlapping information and lower accuracy in monitoring crop growth. Therefore, this study focuses on winter wheat and constructs a comprehensive growth monitoring index (CGIac), based on adaptive weight allocation of growth parameters’ contribution to yield, using data such as leaf area index (LAI), soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, plant height (PH), biomass (BM), and plant water content (PWC). Using UAV data on vegetation indices, feature selection was performed using the Elastic Net. The growth inversion model was then constructed using machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector regression (SVR). Based on the optimal growth inversion model for winter wheat, spatial distribution of wheat growth in the study area is obtained. The findings demonstrated that CGIac outperforms CGIav (constructed using equal weighting) and CGIcv (built using the coefficient of variation) in yield correlation and prediction accuracy. Specifically, the yield correlation of CGIac improved by up to 0.76 compared to individual indices, while yield prediction accuracy increased by up to 23.14%.

202210.3390/agriculture14111900,2022 UAV-Based Multispectral Winter Wheat Growth Monitoring with Adaptive Weight Allocation,"Comprehensive growth index (CGI) more accurately reflects crop growth conditions than single indicators, which is crucial for precision irrigation, fertilization, and yield prediction. However, many current studies overlook the relationships between different growth parameters and their varying contributions to yield, leading to overlapping information and lower accuracy in monitoring crop growth. Therefore, this study focuses on winter wheat and constructs a comprehensive growth monitoring index (CGIac), based on adaptive weight allocation of growth parameters’ contribution to yield, using data such as leaf area index (LAI), soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, plant height (PH), biomass (BM), and plant water content (PWC). Using UAV data on vegetation indices, feature selection was performed using the Elastic Net. The growth inversion model was then constructed using machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector regression (SVR). Based on the optimal growth inversion model for winter wheat, spatial distribution of wheat growth in the study area is obtained. The findings demonstrated that CGIac outperforms CGIav (constructed using equal weighting) and CGIcv (built using the coefficient of variation) in yield correlation and prediction accuracy. Specifically, the yield correlation of CGIac improved by up to 0.76 compared to individual indices, while yield prediction accuracy increased by up to 23.14%. Among the evaluated models, the RF model achieved the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.895 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0058.

In this work reactions are labeled with experimental conditions and network analysis shows that consistencies within clusters of data points can be leveraged to organize this information. In particular, this analysis shows how particular experimental conditions (specifically solvent) are effective in enabling specific organic reactions (Friedel-Crafts, Aldol addition, Claisen condensation, Diels-Alder, and Wittig), including variations within each reaction class. An example of network analysis is shown in the graphical abstract, where data points for a Claisen condensation reaction break into clusters that depend on the catalyst and chemical structure. This type of clustering, which mimics how a chemist reasons, is derived directly from the network. Therefore the findings of this work could augment synthesis planning by providing predictions in a fashion that mimics human chemists. To numerically evaluate solvent prediction ability, three methods are compared: network analysis (through the k-nearest neighbor algorithm), a support vector machine, and a deep neural network. The most accurate method in 4 of the 5 test cases is the network analysis, with deep neural networks also showing good prediction scores.

A series of single-cell and spatial omics algorithms were utilized to uncover the molecular characteristics of ADAM family genes within HCC. The GSVA package was utilized to compute the scores for ADAM family signals, subsequently stratified into three categories: high, medium, and low ADAM signal levels through unsupervised clustering. Furthermore, we developed and rigorously validated an innovative and robust clinical prognosis assessment model by employing 99 mainstream machine learning algorithms in conjunction with co-expression feature spectra of ADAM family genes. To validate our findings, we conducted PCR and IHC experiments to confirm differential expression patterns within the ADAM family genes. Results Gene signals from the ADAM family were notably abundant in endothelial cells, liver cells, and monocyte macrophages. Single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analyses have both revealed the molecular heterogeneity of the ADAM gene family, further emphasizing its significant impact on the development and progression of HCC. In HCC tissues, the expression levels of ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 were markedly elevated. Elevated ADAM family signal scores were linked to adverse clinical outcomes and disruptions in the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming. An ADAM prognosis signal, developed through the utilization of 99 machine learning algorithms, could accurately forecast the survival duration of HCC, achieving an AUC value of approximately 0.9. Conclusions This study represented the inaugural report on the deleterious impact and prognostic significance of ADAM family signals within the tumor microenvironment of HCC.",2023,2024-09-13,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a5d98243250c138efd38742555d600655a9e5

A comprehensive but practical test battery using 5 wearable inertial sensors for multifactorial fall risk assessment was designed. This was followed by an experimental study on 196 community-dwelling Korean older women, categorized as fallers (N1 = 82) and non-fallers (N2 = 114) based on prior history of falls. Six machine learning models (logistic regression, naïve bayes, decision tree, random forest, boosted tree and support vector machine) were proposed for faller classification. Results indicated that compared with non-fallers, fallers performed significantly worse on the test battery. In addition, the application of sensor data and support vector machine for faller classification achieved an overall accuracy of 89.4% with 92.7% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity. These findings suggest that wearable inertial sensor based systems show promise for elderly fall risk assessment, which could be implemented in clinical practice to identify “at-risk” individuals reliably to promote proactive fall prevention.",2017,2018-11-05,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a70d56c431e0c2bb8b789f71f5ba1363b65c9

201810.3390/ijerph16142598,2018 Hip and Wrist-Worn Accelerometer Data Analysis for Toddler Activities,"Although accelerometry data are widely utilized to estimate physical activity and sedentary behavior among children age 3 years or older, for toddlers age 1 and 2 year(s), accelerometry data recorded during such behaviors have been far less examined. In particular, toddler’s unique behaviors, such as riding in a stroller or being carried by an adult, have not yet been examined. The objective of this study was to describe accelerometry signal outputs recorded during participation in nine types of behaviors (i.e., running, walking, climbing up/down, crawling, riding a ride-on toy, standing, sitting, riding in a stroller/wagon, and being carried by an adult) among toddlers. Twenty-four toddlers aged 13 to 35 months (50% girls) performed various prescribed behaviors during free play in a commercial indoor playroom while wearing ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on a hip and a wrist. Participants’ performances were video-recorded. Based on the video data, accelerometer data were annotated with behavior labels to examine accelerometry signal outputs while performing the nine types of behaviors. Accelerometer data collected during 664 behavior assessments from the 21 participants were used for analysis. Hip vertical axis counts for walking were low (median = 49 counts/5 s). They were significantly lower than those recorded while a toddler was “carried” by an adult (median = 144 counts/5 s; p < 0.01). While standing, sitting, and riding in a stroller, very low hip vertical axis counts were registered (median ≤ 5 counts/5 s). Although wrist vertical axis and vector magnitude counts for “carried” were not higher than those for walking, they were higher than the cut-points for sedentary behaviors. Using various accelerometry signal features, machine learning techniques showed 89% accuracy to differentiate the “carried” behavior from ambulatory movements such as running, walking, crawling, and climbing. In conclusion, hip vertical axis counts alone may be unable to capture walking as physical activity and “carried” as sedentary behavior among toddlers. Machine learning techniques that utilize additional accelerometry signal features could help to recognize behavior types, especially to differentiate being “carried” from ambulatory movements.",2018,2019-07-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a71f483a2798bc7411f9fcc6af3a66d0a08c7

Only two of the isomers have been detected in emissions from the interstellar medium (ISM); possible further candidates are identified, and the likelihood of their being detectable is considered. In general, hardly any of these compounds have been discussed in the existing chemical literature, so this work represents an important contribution extending the canon of chemical bonding which can contribute to machine learning, providing a more exacting test of AI applications. The presence in the ISM of acetamide, CH3C(O)NH2, is the subject of current debate with no clear and obvious paths to its formation; it is shown that a 1,3-[H]-transfer from (E,Z)-ethanimidic acid, CH3C(OH)=NH, is feasible in spite of an energy barrier of 130 kJ mol–1.

202010.3390/sym13030486,2020 Towards Accurate Scene Text Detection with Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network,"Scene text detection, this task of detecting text from real images, is a hot research topic in the machine vision community. Most of the current research is based on an anchor box. These methods are complex in model design and time-consuming to train. In this paper, we propose a new Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection (FCOS)-based text detection method that can robustly detect multioriented and multilingual text from natural scene images in a per pixel prediction approach. Our proposed text detector employs an anchor-free approach, unlike state-of-the-art text detectors that do not rely on a predefined anchor box. In order to enhance the feature representation ability of FCOS for text detection tasks, we apply the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) as the backbone network, enhancing the model learning capacity and increasing the receptive field. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on multioriented (ICDAR-2015, ICDAR-2017 MLT) and horizontal (ICDAR-2013) text detection benchmark tasks. Moreover, our method has an f-measure of 88.65 and 86.32 for the benchmark datasets ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015, respectively, and 80.75 for the ICDAR-2017 MLT dataset.",2020,2021-03-16,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d0a52ce890a794b16d3379f96c6cbb7e0acaa

The goal is to enhance networking within these dynamic environments. By leveraging SDN's centralized control capabilities, this study aims to optimize network performance, enhance security, and improve the quality of service in 5G-VANETs. The outcomes of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems and vehicular communication networks. As the VANET milieu operates dynamically, the major issues are to afford high reliability, low latency, and high bandwidth. 5G significantly provides seamless connectivity and ultrafast speed for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Advancements in internet of vehicle brought few security issues such as illegal device access, data injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To avoid these issues, this work implements the Package Filtering Model (PFM) that is trained using machine learning and ready to use for real-time detection. It filters out the fraudulent transaction based on the frequency and behavioural characteristics of the communication.

A systemic review and a meta-analysis. We also provided a retrospective cohort for validation in this study.


OBJECTIVE
(1) Using a meta-analysis to determine the pooled discriminatory ability of The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classical algorithm (CA) and machine learning algorithms (MLA); and (2) test the hypothesis that SORG-CA has less variability in performance than SORG-MLA in non-American validation cohorts as SORG-CA does not incorporates regional-specific variables such as body mass index as input.


METHODS
After data extraction from the included studies, logit-transformation was applied for extracted AUCs for further analysis. The discriminatory abilities of both algorithms were directly compared by their logit (AUC)s. Further subgroup analysis by region (America vs non-America) was also conducted by comparing the corresponding logit (AUC).


RESULTS
The pooled logit (AUC)s of 90-day SORG-CA was .82 (95% confidence interval [CI], .53-.11), 1-year SORG-CA was 1.11 (95% CI, .74-1.48), 90-day SORG-MLA was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.63), and 1-year SORG-MLA was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.17-1.98). All the algorithms performed better in United States than in Taiwan (P < .001). The performance of SORG-CA was less influenced by a non-American cohort than SORG-MLA.


CONCLUSION
These observations might highlight the importance of incorporating region-specific variables into existing models to make them generalizable to racially or geographically distinct regions.",2023,2024-07-28,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000d5b01eaff9e725217d0dfa377c0c688ddf068

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) complicates clinical manifestations of stroke. In this study, we redefined the CSVD burden score and incorporated it into a novel radiological-clinical prediction model for SAP. Materials and methods A total of 1278 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 were included. The participants were divided into training and testing groups using fivefold cross-validation method. Four models, two traditional statistical models (logistic regression and ISAN) and two machine learning models (random forest and support vector machine), were established and evaluated. The outcomes and baseline characteristics were compared between the SAP and non-SAP groups. Results Among the of 1278 patients, 281(22.0%) developed SAP after their first ICH. Multivariate analysis revealed that the logistic regression (LR) model was superior in predicting SAP in both the training and testing groups. Independent predictors of SAP after ICH included total CSVD burden score (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.54), haematoma extension into ventricle (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.87–3.31), haematoma with multilobar involvement (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.44–3.18), transpharyngeal intubation operation (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.7–5.62), admission NIHSS score ≥ 10 (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.42–3.01), male sex (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16–2.52), and age ≥ 67 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.56–3.22). The patients in the SAP group had worse outcomes than those in the non-SAP group. Conclusion This study established a clinically combined imaging model for predicting stroke-associated pneumonia and demonstrated superior performance compared with the existing ISAN model. Given the poor outcomes observed in patients with SAP, the use of individualised predictive nomograms is vital in clinical practice.",2023,2024-07-24,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000e245ed752d1169163ed02ffc2fdadd18e2540

200510.1186/1471-2105-7-319,2005 Protein disorder prediction by condensed PSSM considering propensity for order or disorder,"BackgroundMore and more disordered regions have been discovered in protein sequences, and many of them are found to be functionally significant. Previous studies reveal that disordered regions of a protein can be predicted by its primary structure, the amino acid sequence. One observation that has been widely accepted is that ordered regions usually have compositional bias toward hydrophobic amino acids, and disordered regions are toward charged amino acids. Recent studies further show that employing evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) improves the prediction accuracy of protein disorder. As more and more machine learning techniques have been introduced to protein disorder detection, extracting more useful features with biological insights attracts more attention.ResultsThis paper first studies the effect of a condensed position specific scoring matrix with respect to physicochemical properties (PSSMP) on the prediction accuracy, where the PSSMP is derived by merging several amino acid columns of a PSSM belonging to a certain property into a single column. Next, we decompose each conventional physicochemical property of amino acids into two disjoint groups which have a propensity for order and disorder respectively, and show by experiments that some of the new properties perform better than their parent properties in predicting protein disorder. In order to get an effective and compact feature set on this problem, we propose a hybrid feature selection method that inherits the efficiency of uni-variant analysis and the effectiveness of the stepwise feature selection that explores combinations of multiple features. The experimental results show that the selected feature set improves the performance of a classifier built with Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) in comparison with the feature set constructed with PSSMs or PSSMPs that adopt simply the conventional physicochemical properties.ConclusionDistinguishing disordered regions from ordered regions in protein sequences facilitates the exploration of protein structures and functions. Results based on independent testing data reveal that the proposed predicting model DisPSSMP performs the best among several of the existing packages doing similar tasks, without either under-predicting or over-predicting the disordered regions.

202210.33395/sinkron.v8i3.12721,2022 Comparison of Residual Network-50 and Convolutional Neural Network Conventional Architecture For Fruit Image Classification,"Classification of fruit images using machine learning technology has had a significant impact on human life by enabling accurate recognition of various fruits. With the advancements in technology, machine learning architectures have become increasingly diverse and sophisticated, providing enhanced capabilities for fruit image classification. However, previous studies have primarily focused on classifying fruits at a basic level. Therefore, there is a growing need for the development and application of Fruit Image Classification systems within the community, particularly in the field of agriculture. Such applications can play a pivotal role in leveraging technology to benefit the agricultural sector, empowering users to gain satisfaction and knowledge regarding different fruits through the utilization of these applications. In this study, we employ both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and a Residual Network-50 for fruit image classification. To ensure robust performance evaluation, the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, with fruits categorized into specific classes. Furthermore, identical preprocessing and optimization techniques are applied to both architectures to maintain consistency and fairness during the evaluation process. The results of our classification experiments on a dataset consisting of 17 different fruit classes reveal that the conventional CNN architecture achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.998 (99%) with a minimal loss of 0.009. On the other hand, the Residual Network-50 demonstrates a slightly lower accuracy of 0.994 (99%) but with a slightly higher loss of 0.02. Despite the higher loss, the Residual Network-50's accuracy remains comparable to that of the conventional architecture, showcasing its potential for fruit image classification. By leveraging the power of machine learning and these advanced architectures, fruit image classification systems can provide valuable insights and assistance to users.

The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

As a result, for hydropower generation to be sustainable, future water availability in hydropower plants must be known. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely estimate how the river flow will alter as a result of changing rainfall patterns. Finding the best value for the hyper-parameters is one of the problems with machine learning algorithms, which have lately been adopted by many academics. In this research, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is integrated with a nature-inspired optimizer, namely Cuckoo search algorithm (CS-ANN).

Then, the accuracy of the proposed model will be then examined with the stand-alone Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The statistical indices results indicate that the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model showed an improvement based on R 2 value as compared to ANN model with R 2 of 0.900 at training stage and R 2 of 0.935 at testing stage. RMSE value, for ANN model, is 127.79 m 3 /s for training stage and 12.7 m 3 /s at testing stage.

It aims at automatically classifying opinions in order to position them on a sentiment scale, thus allowing to characterize a set of opinions without having to rely on a human to read them. Currently, opinion analysis offers us a lot of information related to public opinion, either in the commercial world or in the political world. Many studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB), perform well in this type of classification.

Hence, the limitations of prediction models can highly impact prioritizing maintenance tasks and allocating budget. This study aims to investigate the potential of different predictive models in reaching an effective and efficient maintenance plan. This paper reviews the literature on predictive analytics for a set of highway assets. It also highlights the gaps and limitations of the current methodologies, such as subjective assumptions and simplifications applied in deterministic and probabilistic approaches. This article additionally discusses how these shortcomings impact the application and accuracy of the methods, and how advanced predictive analytics can mitigate the challenges. In this review, we discuss how advancements in technologies coupled with ever-increasing computing power are creating opportunities for a paradigm shift in predictive analytics. We also propose new research directions including the application of advanced machine learning to develop extensible and scalable prediction models and leveraging emerging sensing technologies for collecting, storing and analyzing the data.

When the size of datasets becomes very large, it may be infeasible to store all of the high-dimensional datasets on one machine, or at least to keep the datasets in memory. In this paper, we consider penalized expectile regression using smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and adaptive LASSO penalties, which can effectively detect the heteroskedasticity of high-dimensional data. We propose a communication-efficient approach for distributed sparsity learning, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines.

202010.3390/app112210795,2020 Fine-Grained Named Entity Recognition Using a Multi-Stacked Feature Fusion and Dual-Stacked Output in Korean,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task to identify spans that mention named entities and to annotate them with predefined named entity classes. Although many NER models based on machine learning have been proposed, their performance in terms of processing fine-grained NER tasks was less than acceptable. This is because the training data of a fine-grained NER task is much more unbalanced than those of a coarse-grained NER task. To overcome the problem presented by unbalanced data, we propose a fine-grained NER model that compensates for the sparseness of fine-grained NEs by using the contextual information of coarse-grained NEs. From another viewpoint, many NER models have used different levels of features, such as part-of-speech tags and gazetteer look-up results, in a nonhierarchical manner. Unfortunately, these models experience the feature interference problem. Our solution to this problem is to adopt a multi-stacked feature fusion scheme, which accepts different levels of features as its input. The proposed model is based on multi-stacked long short-term memories (LSTMs) with a multi-stacked feature fusion layer for acquiring multilevel embeddings and a dual-stacked output layer for predicting fine-grained NEs based on the categorical information of coarse-grained NEs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed model is capable of state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the proposed model can effectively alleviate the unbalanced data problem that frequently occurs in a fine-grained NER task. In addition, the multi-stacked feature fusion layer contributes to the improvement of NER performance, confirming that the proposed model can alleviate the feature interference problem.

However, unintended access to these transducer signals (bypassing normal on-board data access controls) may allow sensitive user interaction information to be detected and thereby exploited. In this study, we show that acoustic features extracted from the on-board microphone signals, supported with accelerometer and gyroscope signals, may be used together with machine learning techniques to successfully determine the user’s touch input location on a touchscreen: our ensemble model, namely the random forest model, predicts touch input location with up to 86% accuracy in a realistic scenario.

A case-control study was conducted and included 177 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 173 control subjects to study the involvement of CD36 gene rs1761667 (G>A) and rs1527483 (C>T) polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of T2DM and dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Lipid profile, blood sugar, gender and age were measured and recorded. Also, genotyping analysis for both polymorphisms was performed. Following statistical analysis, 10 different neural networks and machine learning (ML) tools were used to predict subjects with diabetes or dyslipidemia. Towards further understanding of the role of CD36 protein and gene in T2DM and dyslipidemia, a protein-protein interaction network and meta-analysis were carried out. For both polymorphisms, the genotypic frequencies were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). On the other hand, some ML tools like multilayer perceptron gave high prediction accuracy (≥ 0.75) and Cohen’s kappa (κ) (≥ 0.5). Interestingly, in K-star tool, the accuracy and Cohen’s κ values were enhanced by including the genotyping results as inputs (0.73 and 0.46, respectively, compared to 0.67 and 0.34 without including them).

This research focuses on exploring the latest solutions in preventing DDoS attacks and emphasizes how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is involved in enhancing end-to-end detection techniques. Through the analysis of several key approaches, this work notes that AI-guided models quickly identify and counteract any unusual traffic patterns that may indicate an oncoming DDoS attack. Essential aspects towards creating more resilient networks against such attacks include machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data analytics together with AI based detection systems for traffic pattern recognition. Importantly, AI does well in behavioral analysis because it can distinguish and adapt to changing attack vectors. Additionally, it puts AI into perspective as making positive mitigation strategies possible that contain quick interferences such as temporary halt of traffic, rerouting and targeted block listing with real time control panel operations. On the contrary, current DDoS detection prevention techniques remain critically addressed of persistent challenges and limitations fundamental to them. From what emerges, they should always be ready for innovation and improvement because of how attacks might evolve over time. This paper aligns itself with the position that AI-driven detection mechanisms are natural to network security against DDoS attacks. It underlines the importance of integrating AI-based solutions with conventional practices in order to enhance network resilience and efficiently counteract cyber threats that are evolving all the time.",2023,2024-04-20,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0017097ec9fb7d72967cb7823d7a34ef224cbfc4

Essential aspects towards creating more resilient networks against such attacks include machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data analytics together with AI based detection systems for traffic pattern recognition. Importantly, AI does well in behavioral analysis because it can distinguish and adapt to changing attack vectors. Additionally, it puts AI into perspective as making positive mitigation strategies possible that contain quick interferences such as temporary halt of traffic, rerouting and targeted block listing with real time control panel operations. On the contrary, current DDoS detection prevention techniques remain critically addressed of persistent challenges and limitations fundamental to them. From what emerges, they should always be ready for innovation and improvement because of how attacks might evolve over time. This paper aligns itself with the position that AI-driven detection mechanisms are natural to network security against DDoS attacks. It underlines the importance of integrating AI-based solutions with conventional practices in order to enhance network resilience and efficiently counteract cyber threats that are evolving all the time.",2022,2024-04-20,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0017097ec9fb7d72967cb7823d7a34ef224cbfc4

In this paper, we present a novel efficient method for thermal and energy management based on bimodal airflow-temperature sensing and reinforcement learning, which expedites an exploration process by self-learning and adjusts action policy only through actuators interacting with the environment, being free of the controlled object model and priori experiences. In general, training of reinforcement learning requires a large amount of data iterations, which takes a long time and is not suitable for real-time control. Here, we propose an approach to speed up the learning process by indicating the action adjustment direction.

The proposed thermal and energy management incorporates bimodal parametric sensing with an improved actor-critic algorithm to realize self-learning control.

201910.1088/1361-6560/ab9efc,2019 Improving depth-of-interaction resolution in pixellated PET detectors using neural networks,"Parallax error is a common issue in high-resolution preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) scanners as well as in clinical scanners that have a long axial field of view (FOV), which increases estimation uncertainty of the annihilation position and therefore degrades the spatial resolution. A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction (DOI) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network (NN), as well as a multiple linear regression (MLR)-based method to estimate DOI in depolished PET detector arrays with single-sided readout.

201810.1088/1361-6560/ab9efc,2018 Improving depth-of-interaction resolution in pixellated PET detectors using neural networks,"Parallax error is a common issue in high-resolution preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) scanners as well as in clinical scanners that have a long axial field of view (FOV), which increases estimation uncertainty of the annihilation position and therefore degrades the spatial resolution. A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction (DOI) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network (NN), as well as a multiple linear regression (MLR)-based method to estimate DOI in depolished PET detector arrays with single-sided readout.

Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA* duplexes.

202010.1186/s12885-021-08704-9,2020 Identifying novel transcript biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using RNA-Seq datasets and machine learning,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the world owing to limitations in its prognosis. The current prognosis approaches include radiological examination and detection of serum biomarkers, however, both have limited efficiency and are ineffective in early prognosis. Due to such limitations, we propose to use RNA-Seq data for evaluating putative higher accuracy biomarkers at the transcript level that could help in early prognosis. To identify such potential transcript biomarkers, RNA-Seq data for healthy liver and various HCC cell models were subjected to five different machine learning algorithms: random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and neural networks. Various metrics, namely sensitivity, specificity, MCC, informedness, and AUC-ROC (except for support vector machine) were evaluated. The algorithms that produced the highest values for all metrics were chosen to extract the top features that were subjected to recursive feature elimination. Through recursive feature elimination, the least number of features were obtained to differentiate between the healthy and HCC cell models. From the metrics used, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of the known protein biomarkers for HCC is comparatively lower than complete transcriptomics data. Among the different machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector machine demonstrated the best performance. Using recursive feature elimination on top features of random forest and support vector machine three transcripts were selected that had an accuracy of 0.97 and kappa of 0.93. Of the three transcripts, two were protein coding (PARP2–202 and SPON2–203) and one was a non-coding transcript (CYREN-211). Lastly, we demonstrated that these three selected transcripts outperformed randomly taken three transcripts (15,000 combinations), hence were not chance findings, and could then be an interesting candidate for new HCC biomarker development. Using RNA-Seq data combined with machine learning approaches can aid in finding novel transcript biomarkers. The three biomarkers identified: PARP2–202, SPON2–203, and CYREN-211, presented the highest accuracy among all other transcripts in differentiating the healthy and HCC cell models.

201710.3390/APP8081280,2017 Classification of Children’s Sitting Postures Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"Sitting on a chair in an awkward posture or sitting for a long period of time is a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders. A postural habit that has been formed cannot be changed easily. It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms.

202110.1371/journal.pone.0272991,2021 Semantic textual similarity for modern standard and dialectal Arabic using transfer learning,"Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is the task of identifying the semantic correlation between two sentences of the same or different languages. STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set.",2021,2022-08-11,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ce6614288b92f436756e13219135d87cac363
202010.1371/journal.pone.0272991,2020 Semantic textual similarity for modern standard and dialectal Arabic using transfer learning,"Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is the task of identifying the semantic correlation between two sentences of the same or different languages. STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set.

202210.3389/fnins.2023.1143239,2022 Neuroimaging mechanisms of acupuncture on functional reorganization for post-stroke motor improvement: a machine learning-based functional magnetic resonance imaging study,"Objective Motor recovery is crucial in stroke rehabilitation, and acupuncture can influence recovery. Neuroimaging and machine learning approaches provide new research directions to explore the brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms after stroke. We applied machine learning to predict the classification of the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for motor improvement and identify the neuroimaging features, in order to explore brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms for motor recovery after stroke. Methods In this study, 49 patients with unilateral motor pathway injury (basal ganglia and/or corona radiata) after ischemic stroke were included and evaluated the motor function by Fugl–Meyer Assessment scores (FMA) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up sessions. Patients were divided by the difference between the twice FMA scores into one group showing minimal clinically important difference (MCID group, n = 28) and the other group with no minimal clinically important difference (N-MCID, n = 21). Machine learning was performed by PRoNTo software to predict the classification of the patients and identify the feature brain regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, a matched group of healthy controls (HC, n = 26) was enrolled. Patients and HC underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination in the resting state and in the acupuncture state (acupuncture at the Yanglingquan point on one side) to compare the differences in brain functional connectivity (FC) and acupuncture effects. Results Through machine learning, we obtained a balance accuracy rate of 75.51% and eight feature ROIs. Compared to HC, we found that the stroke patients with lower FC between these feature ROIs with other brain regions, while patients in the MCID group exhibited a wider range of lower FC. When acupuncture was applied to Yanglingquan (GB 34), the abnormal FC of patients was decreased, with different targets of effects in different groups. Conclusion Feature ROIs identified by machine learning can predict the classification of stroke patients with different motor improvements, and the FC between these ROIs with other brain regions is decreased. Acupuncture can modulate the bilateral cerebral hemispheres to restore abnormal FC via different targets, thereby promoting motor recovery after stroke.

Significance Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms have rapidly become much more widespread for numerous biomedical applications, including the diagnosis and categorization of disease and injury. Aim Here, we seek to characterize the recent growth of ML techniques that use imaging data to classify burn wound severity and report on the accuracies of different approaches. Approach To this end, we present a comprehensive literature review of preclinical and clinical studies using ML techniques to classify the severity of burn wounds. Results The majority of these reports used digital color photographs as input data to the classification algorithms, but recently there has been an increasing prevalence of the use of ML approaches using input data from more advanced optical imaging modalities (e.g., multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography), in addition to multimodal techniques. The classification accuracy of the different methods is reported; it typically ranges from ∼70% to 90% relative to the current gold standard of clinical judgment. Conclusions The field would benefit from systematic analysis of the effects of different input data modalities, training/testing sets, and ML classifiers on the reported accuracy.

Their unobtrusive nature and ability to provide reliable heart rate measurements facilitate the estimation of cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes, as quantified by maximum consumption of oxygen uptake. Previous studies have employed data-driven models which use heart rate information to estimate the cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes. This signifies the physiological relevance of heart rate and heart rate variability for the estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. In this work, the heart rate variability features that were extracted from both exercise and recovery segments were fed to three different Machine Learning models to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of 856 athletes performing Graded Exercise Testing. A total of 101 features from exercise and 30 features from recovery segments were given as input to three feature selection methods to avoid overfitting of the models and to obtain relevant features. This resulted in the increase of model’s accuracy by 5.7% for exercise and 4.3% for recovery. Further, post-modelling analysis was performed to remove the deviant points in two cases, initially in both training and testing and then only in training set, using k-Nearest Neighbour. In the former case, the removal of deviant points led to a reduction of 19.3% and 18.0% in overall estimation error for exercise and recovery, respectively. In the latter case, which mimicked the real-world scenario, the average R value of the models was observed to be 0.72 and 0.70 for exercise and recovery, respectively. From the above experimental approach, the utility of heart rate variability to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of large population of athletes was validated.

The present study aimed to identify potential sex-specific biomarkers strongly associated with IMF deposition in low- and high-IMF pig populations. The GSE144780 expression dataset of IMF deposition-related genes were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in male and female low-IMF (162 DEGs, including 64 up- and 98 down-regulated genes) and high-IMF pigs (202 DEGs, including 147 up- and 55 down-regulated genes). Moreover, hub genes were screened via PPI network construction. Furthermore, hub genes were screened for potential sex-specific biomarkers using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator machine learning algorithm, and sex-specific biomarkers in low-IMF (troponin I (TNNI1), myosin light chain 9(MYL9), and serpin family C member 1(SERPINC1)) and high-IMF pigs (CD4 molecule (CD4), CD2 molecule (CD2), and amine oxidase copper-containing 2(AOC2)) were identified, and then verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in semimembranosus muscles. Additionally, the gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of hallmark gene sets were collectively performed on the identified biomarkers. Finally, the transcription factor-biomarker and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (biomarker) networks were predicted. The identified potential sex-specific biomarkers may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of IMF deposition and the beneficial foundation for improving meat quality in pig breeding.",2022,2023-08-25,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e4348bf3ea69ac952c0078282041986cdec3d

202110.3390/rs14112676,2021 Automated Multi-Scale and Multivariate Geological Logging from Drill-Core Hyperspectral Data,"Hyperspectral drill-core scanning adds value to exploration campaigns by providing continuous, high-resolution mineralogical data over the length of entire boreholes. However, multivariate mineralogical data must be transformed into lithological domains such that it is compatible with interpolation techniques and be usable for geomodeling. Manual interpretation of multivariate drill-core data is a challenging, time-consuming and subjective task, and automated or semi-automated approaches are needed. However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection. In this way, the correlation pattern between the variables is incorporated into the segmentation. The scalogram accurately locates the geological boundaries at depth and yields hierarchical geological domains with mineralogical composition characteristics. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a synthetic as well as a real multivariate dataset. The real dataset consists of mineral abundances derived from drill-core hyperspectral imaging data acquired in Elvira, a shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D. Our approach provides an automatic way to transform hyperspectral image-derived mineral maps into vertically coherent geological units that are appropriate inputs for 3D geological modeling workflows. Moreover, the method improves the boundary detection and geological domaining by making use of multivariate information.",2021,2022-06-02,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e8d27211bfbc49a09b646e6fdfdffb798d8cd

These methods outperform traditional, rule-based approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of intersecting features. However, existing deep learning-based AFR methods face two major challenges. The initial challenge stems from the frequent utilization of voxelized or point-cloud representations of CAD models, resulting in the unfortunate loss of valuable geometric and topological information inherent in original Boundary representation (B-Rep) models. The second challenge involves the limitation of supervised deep learning methods in identifying machining features that are not present in the predefined dataset. This constraint renders them suboptimal for the continually evolving datasets of real industrial scenarios. To address the first challenge, this study introduces a graph-structured language, Multidimensional Attributed Face-Edge Graph (maFEG), crafted to encapsulate the intricate geometric and topological details of CAD models. Furthermore, a graph neural network, Sheet-metalNet, is proposed for the efficient learning and interpretation of maFEGs. To tackle the second challenge, a three-component incremental learning strategy is proposed: an initial phase of pre-training and fine-tuning, a prototype sampling-based replay, and a stage employing knowledge distillation for parameter regularization. The effectiveness of Sheet-metalNet and its complementary incremental learning strategy is evaluated using the open-source MFCAD++ dataset and the newly created SMCAD dataset.

202310.3390/foods13071037,2023 Optimization of Online Soluble Solids Content Detection Models for Apple Whole Fruit with Different Mode Spectra Combined with Spectral Correction and Model Fusion,"Soluble solids content (SSC) is one of the main quality indicators of apples, and it is important to improve the precision of online SSC detection of whole apple fruit. Therefore, the spectral pre-processing method of spectral-to-spectral ratio (S/S), as well as multiple characteristic wavelength member model fusion (MCMF) and characteristic wavelength and non-characteristic wavelength member model fusion (CNCMF) methods, were proposed for improving the detection performance of apple whole fruit SSC by diffuse reflection (DR), diffuse transmission (DT) and full transmission (FT) spectra. The modeling analysis showed that the S/S- partial least squares regression models for all three mode spectra had high prediction performance.

202210.3390/foods13071037,2022 Optimization of Online Soluble Solids Content Detection Models for Apple Whole Fruit with Different Mode Spectra Combined with Spectral Correction and Model Fusion,"Soluble solids content (SSC) is one of the main quality indicators of apples, and it is important to improve the precision of online SSC detection of whole apple fruit. Therefore, the spectral pre-processing method of spectral-to-spectral ratio (S/S), as well as multiple characteristic wavelength member model fusion (MCMF) and characteristic wavelength and non-characteristic wavelength member model fusion (CNCMF) methods, were proposed for improving the detection performance of apple whole fruit SSC by diffuse reflection (DR), diffuse transmission (DT) and full transmission (FT) spectra. The modeling analysis showed that the S/S- partial least squares regression models for all three mode spectra had high prediction performance.

202310.1192/bjo.2024.440,2023 Statistical Machine Learning Methods to Handle Missing PHQ-8 Score – Assuming Missing at Random,"Aims Missing data is a challenge that most researchers encounter. It is a concern that continues to be analyzed and addressed for solutions. Missing data occurs when there is no data stored for certain variables relating to participants. In health surveys, when participants answer in the form of “I don't know” or “I'd prefer not to answer”, these responses can, in many cases, be categorized as missing data responses from a participant in a specific category or question. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is an essential tool in healthcare and clinical settings to assess an individual's mental health, specifically related to symptoms of depression. The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with the total score obtained by summing the scores for each item. Higher PHQ-8 scores indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. We used empirical data from a previous study on depression symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease to study the effect of considering the answers “I do not know” and “I prefer not to answer” as missing values when estimating the percentage of depression using PHQ-8. Moreover, we studied the effect of the complete case analysis and multiple imputation on parameter estimates and confidence intervals. The outcome of this study aims to shed light on the development of missing data procedural knowledge and provide methodological support for public health decision-making when data with missing values are collected. Furthermore, this study aims to prevent the exclusion of missing data rather than to generate data. Methods A simulation study with 1000 replicates was performed. Four common statistical machine learning methods for handling missing values were included in this study. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-Means, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest (RF) imputations. Five clusters were used for KNN and K-mean. Likewise, five multiple imputations were used for the CART and RF methods. The simulation was based on publicly available data with available PHQ-8 data for 1096 subjects. In the simulation study and for each replication, multivariate missing values were generated using the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% proportions of missingness. The percent of depression was calculated using the PHQ-8 questionnaire and a comparison was made between estimated actual depression, complete-case analysis, KNN, Kmean, RF, and CART, respectively. Results The Median age of the subjects was 69 (interquartile range: 61–67) and more males (72.9%) than females were included in the data. The estimated actual depression was 16.8, whereas the estimated percentage of depression varies between 6.9–13.5, 16.2–16.7, 16.3–16.7, 16.6–16.7 and 16.7–16.8 for the complete case, KNN, Kmean, RF and CART respectively. Conclusion The results of this simulation study show that missing PHQ-8 data are best handled by applying multiple imputations based on CART or RF. However, using K-Means or KNN leads to a good estimate of the true percentage of depression. Furthermore, the results of this simulation study show that complete-case analysis leads to biased estimates of the true percentage of depression. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to address the problem of missing PHQ-8 data under the assumption of missing not at random.",2023,2024-06-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00208549d427e2c8e8e9e33cad0647915314fc3a

202010.1007/s13042-022-01553-3,2020 Data augmentation in natural language processing: a novel text generation approach for long and short text classifiers,"In many cases of machine learning, research suggests that the development of training data might have a higher relevance than the choice and modelling of classifiers themselves. Thus, data augmentation methods have been developed to improve classifiers by artificially created training data. In NLP, there is the challenge of establishing universal rules for text transformations which provide new linguistic patterns. In this paper, we present and evaluate a text generation method suitable to increase the performance of classifiers for long and short texts. We achieved promising improvements when evaluating short as well as long text tasks with the enhancement by our text generation method. Especially with regard to small data analytics, additive accuracy gains of up to 15.53% and 3.56% are achieved within a constructed low data regime, compared to the no augmentation baseline and another data augmentation technique. As the current track of these constructed regimes is not universally applicable, we also show major improvements in several real world low data tasks (up to +4.84 F1-score). Since we are evaluating the method from many perspectives (in total 11 datasets), we also observe situations where the method might not be suitable.

Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that can automatically learn representative features to achieve better results in areas of image recognition. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use deep learning methods to identify crop pests and diseases and to find efficient and fast real-time image recognition methods of disease. Deep learning is a newly developed discipline in recent years.

This paper analyzes the classical and the latest neural network structure based on the theory of deep learning. For the problem that the network based on natural image classification is not suitable for crop pest and disease identification tasks, this paper has improved the network structure that can take care of both recognition speed and recognition accuracy. We discussed the influence of the crop pest and disease feature extraction layer on recognition performance. Finally, we used the inner layer as the main structure to be the pest and disease feature extraction layer by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the inner and global average pooling layers.

202110.5194/amt-15-7211-2022,2021 High-fidelity retrieval from instantaneous line-of-sight returns of nacelle-mounted lidar including supervised machine learning,"Abstract. Wind turbine applications that leverage nacelle-mounted
Doppler lidar are hampered by several sources of uncertainty in the lidar
measurement, affecting both bias and random errors. Two problems encountered
especially for nacelle-mounted lidar are solid interference due to
intersection of the line of sight with solid objects behind, within, or in
front of the measurement volume and spectral noise due primarily to
limited photon capture. These two uncertainties, especially that due to
solid interference, can be reduced with high-fidelity retrieval techniques
(i.e., including both quality assurance/quality control and subsequent
parameter estimation). Our work compares three such techniques, including
conventional thresholding, advanced filtering, and a novel application of
supervised machine learning with ensemble neural networks, based on their
ability to reduce uncertainty introduced by the two observed nonideal
spectral features while keeping data availability high. The approach
leverages data from a field experiment involving a continuous-wave (CW)
SpinnerLidar from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) that provided
scans of a wide range of flows both unwaked and waked by a field turbine.
Independent measurements from an adjacent meteorological tower within the
sampling volume permit experimental validation of the instantaneous velocity
uncertainty remaining after retrieval that stems from solid interference and
strong spectral noise, which is a validation that has not been performed
previously. All three methods perform similarly for non-interfered returns,
but the advanced filtering and machine learning techniques perform better
when solid interference is present, which allows them to produce overall
standard deviations of error between 0.2 and 0.3 m s−1, or a 1 %–22 %
improvement versus the conventional thresholding technique, over the rotor
height for the unwaked cases. Between the two improved techniques, the
advanced filtering produces 3.5 % higher overall data availability, while
the machine learning offers a faster runtime (i.e., ∼ 1 s
to evaluate) that is therefore more commensurate with the requirements of
real-time turbine control. The retrieval techniques are described in terms
of application to CW lidar, though they are also relevant to pulsed lidar.
Previous work by the authors (Brown and Herges, 2020) explored a novel
attempt to quantify uncertainty in the output of a high-fidelity lidar
retrieval technique using simulated lidar returns; this article provides
true uncertainty quantification versus independent measurement and does so
for three techniques rather than one.

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from proximal sensors and the high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provide an opportunity to monitor the crop water status efficiently. Based on data from an experimental tomato field with intensive aerial and plant-based measurements, we developed random forest machine learning regression models to estimate tomato stem water potential (ψ stem), (using observations from proximal sensors and 12-band UAV imagery, respectively, along with weather data. The proximal sensor-based model estimation agreed well with the plant ψ stem with R 2 of 0.74 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.63 bars. The model included PRI, normalized difference vegetation index, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature and tracked well with the seasonal dynamics of ψ stem across different plots. A separate model, built with multiple vegetation indices (VIs) from UAV imagery and weather variables, had an R 2 of 0.81 and MAE of 0.67 bars. The plant-level ψ stem maps generated from UAV imagery closely represented the water status differences of plots under different irrigation treatments and also tracked well the temporal change among flights. PRI was found to be the most important VI in both the proximal sensor- and the UAV-based models, providing critical information on tomato plant water status. This study demonstrated that machine learning models can accurately estimate the water status by integrating PRI, other VIs, and weather data, and thus facilitate data-driven irrigation management for processing tomatoes.",2022,2023-04-06,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00233edfe560e68440abb54ec536340659c4e1d7

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a washing procedure that guarantees effective and safe cleaning. This organization recommends that States promote this activity and monitor it continuously. Based on this fact, this article presents a work oriented to study the feasibility of identifying the moments in which a person carried out a hand washing, determining its beginning and duration, as well as if these washings were compliant with the WHO guidelines. The identification of washing moments is made through the analysis, by means of Machine Learning techniques, of the data that can be collected from the inertial sensors of the smartwatch the person is wearing. This study was carried out with the participation of 15 volunteers. Data was not only collected in controlled settings but, also, more than 600 hours of sensor measurements come from free-live conditions. The results of the study showed that it is feasible to build a solid solution based on the use of low cost wearables for the identification of washing moments. The solution is very effective (with F1 over 95%) with user-dependent models.

This study retrospectively investigated newly diagnosed cases of MBNs from our laboratory to investigate mutation landscapes in Chinese patients with MBNs and to combine mutational information and machine learning (ML) into clinical applications for MBNs, especially for subtype classification. Methods Samples from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database were collected for ML model construction and cases from our laboratory were used for ML model validation. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation Random Forest algorithm was used for ML model construction. Mutation detection was performed by NGS and tumor cell size was confirmed by cell morphology and/or flow cytometry in our laboratory. Results Totally 849 newly diagnosed MBN cases from our laboratory were retrospectively identified and included in mutational landscape analyses. Patterns of gene mutations in a variety of MBN subtypes were found, important to investigate tumorigenesis in MBNs. A long list of novel mutations was revealed, valuable to both functional studies and clinical applications. By combining gene mutation information revealed by NGS and ML, we established ML models that provide valuable information for MBN subtype classification.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stage of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this, we proposed a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. In general we have six machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, classifier and feed forward neural network to establish models. In existing system random forest achieved the performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. In proposed system, By analysing the misjudgments generated by the above model, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron which could achieve an efficient accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.

The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease’s onset. The findings underline the potential of machine learning to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and therapy planning while emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in artificial intelligence-based healthcare systems.",2024,,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0024c33a8cca7175b92880b8c47940deeb05e87c

The severity of MS disease is monitored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, composed of several functional sub-scores. Early and accurate classification of MS disease severity is critical for slowing down or preventing disease progression via applying early therapeutic intervention strategies. Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) create opportunities to apply data-driven and predictive modeling tools for this goal. Previous studies focusing on using single-modal machine learning and deep learning algorithms were limited in terms of prediction accuracy due to data insufficiency or model simplicity.

Our contribution has two main facets. First, we describe a pioneering effort to integrate structured EHR data, neuroimaging data and clinical notes to build a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict patient’s MS severity. The proposed pipeline demonstrates up to 19% increase in terms of the area under the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) compared to models using single-modal data.

For this reason, we aim our proposed framework to be a unified test and evaluation pipeline for ML models predicting cancer sensitivity data, facilitating unbiased benchmarking to support teams to improve on the state of the art.",2021,2023-10-30,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0025a4ad16f3d6695cb036e42f78dd97c7404a71
202110.1155/2022/8404931,2021 Machine Learning-Based Classification and Evaluation of Regional Ethnic Traditional Sports Tourism Resources,"Traditional sports in ethnic minority regions are a valuable cultural heritage. Regional ethnic traditional sports are not only a sports business but also a tourism resource. The construction of a reasonable regional sports tourism resource classification model is fundamental to the development of sports tourism resources. However, the existing sports tourism resources classification is mostly constructed manually based on the national standard tourism resources classification system. The efficiency and accuracy of the traditional manual classification are poor and cannot reflect the characteristics of regional ethnic traditional sports tourism. In order to solve the above problems, a machine learning-based classification method for regional ethnic traditional sports tourism resources is proposed. Firstly, the relevant concepts and characteristics of traditional sports tourism resources are introduced. Then, taking the development of traditional sports of ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province as the research object, SWOT analysis, literature, interview, questionnaire, and mathematical statistics are used to investigate and analyse the overall status of the development of regional ethnic traditional sports. Secondly, a classification evaluation method based on an optimised back-propagation (BP) neural network is proposed. Finally, the optimised BP neural network model is applied to the classification of traditional sports tourism resources. The experimental results show that the optimised BP model performs well in the classification of traditional sports tourism resources, verifying its effectiveness.",2021,2022-08-21,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0025b2930cceb1d375bbea847a1b059fbc4ebc26

202410.1186/s40644-025-00857-1,2024 Robust vs. Non-robust radiomic features: the quest for optimal machine learning models using phantom and clinical studies,"Purpose This study aimed to select robust features against lung motion in a phantom study and use them as input to feature selection algorithms and machine learning classifiers in a clinical study to predict the lymphovascular invasion (LVI) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results of robust features were also compared with conventional techniques without considering the robustness of radiomic features. Methods An in-house developed lung phantom was developed with two 22mm lesion sizes based on a clinical study. A specific motor was built to simulate motion in two orthogonal directions. Lesions of both clinical and phantom studies were segmented using a Fuzzy C-means-based segmentation algorithm. After inducing motion and extracting 105 radiomic features in 4 feature sets, including shape, first-, second-, and higher-order statistics features from each region of interest (ROI) of the phantom image, statistical analyses were performed to select robust features against motion. Subsequently, these robust features and a total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from 126 clinical data. Various feature selection (FS) and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers were implemented to predict the LVI of NSCLC, followed by comparing the results of predicting LVI using robust features with common conventional techniques not considering the robustness of radiomic features. Results Our results demonstrated that selecting robust features as input to FS algorithms and ML classifiers surges the sensitivity, which has a gentle negative effect on the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) of predictions compared with commonly used methods in 12 of 15 outcomes. The top performance of the LVI prediction was achieved by the NB classifier and RFE FS without considering the robustness of radiomic features with 95% area under the curve of AUC, 67% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, the top performance of the LVI prediction using robust features belonged to the NB classifier and Boruta feature selection with 92% AUC, 86% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Conclusion Robustness over various influential factors is critical and should be considered in a radiomic study. Selecting robust features is a solution to overcome the low reproducibility of radiomic features. Although setting robust features against motion in a phantom study has a minor negative impact on the accuracy and AUC of LVI prediction, it boosts the sensitivity of prediction to a large extent.",2024,2025-03-12,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0025c929a79041661d68d3ae38c723bc56c256d0

We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration.

Thirty percent of patients do not respond to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Sialylation is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosing CD and predicting anti-TNF medication outcomes in CD. Three potential biomarkers (SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2) were screened using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning based on sialylation-related genes. Moreover, the combined model of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 showed excellent diagnostic value in both the training and validation cohorts. Importantly, a Sial-score was constructed based on the expression of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2. The Sial-low group showed a lower level of immune infiltration than the Sial-high group. Anti-TNF therapy was effective for 94.4% of patients in the Sial-low group but only 15.8% in the Sial-high group. The Sial-score had an outstanding ability to predict and distinguish between responders and non-responders.

202010.3389/fgene.2022.1065297,2020 Landscape of sialylation patterns identify biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of response to anti-TNF therapy in crohn’s disease,"Crohn’s disease (CD), a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causes chronic gastrointestinal tract inflammation. Thirty percent of patients do not respond to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Sialylation is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosing CD and predicting anti-TNF medication outcomes in CD. Three potential biomarkers (SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2) were screened using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning based on sialylation-related genes. Moreover, the combined model of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 showed excellent diagnostic value in both the training and validation cohorts. Importantly, a Sial-score was constructed based on the expression of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2. The Sial-low group showed a lower level of immune infiltration than the Sial-high group. Anti-TNF therapy was effective for 94.4% of patients in the Sial-low group but only 15.8% in the Sial-high group. The Sial-score had an outstanding ability to predict and distinguish between responders and non-responders. Our comprehensive analysis indicates that SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 play essential roles in pathogenesis and anti-TNF therapy resistance in CD. Furthermore, it may provide novel concepts for customizing treatment for individual patients with CD.",2020,2022-11-14,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002772ac0872632e92181660f0bc5c7f0299c3fe

The Baekje weir in South Korea presents an interesting case as the weir has undergone full gate opening, which is generally not the case for weirs and reservoirs, providing valuable opportunity for simulating weir removal conditions. The main objectives are investigation of groundwater level fluctuations under various weir operations, distances from the weir, and seasonal variations. The study utilizes observed data that simulates conditions with and without the weir, including scenarios of full gate opening. Multiple machine learning algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—are used to develop accurate groundwater level prediction models. The models' performance is assessed using coefficient of determination, Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indices, and visualized through Taylor diagrams. Results indicate that XGBoost outperforms other models in all three groups during both training and testing phases. Specifically, XGBoost surpasses RF by 2.09% (R2), 5.66% (RMSE), and 10.1% (MAE) in training, and outperforms SVR by 11.2% (R2), 42.0% (RMSE), and 129.2% (MAE) in testing.

201610.1109/JTEHM.2019.2892970,2016 In-Bed Pose Estimation: Deep Learning With Shallow Dataset,"This paper presents a robust human posture and body parts detection method under a specific application scenario known as in-bed pose estimation. Although the human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied extensively in the last few decades, the in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose estimation problems. However, the in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes with specific challenges, including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout the day and having pose distribution different from the common human surveillance viewpoint. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly reduce the effectiveness of the existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge, the infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with the unconventional pose perspective, a 2- end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. The deep learning framework proves to be the most effective model in human pose estimation; however, the lack of large public dataset for in-bed poses prevents us from using a large network from scratch. In this paper, we explored the idea of employing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-tuning the model using our own shallow (limited in size and different in perspective and color) in-bed IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-trained CNN called convolutional pose machine (CPM) was fine-tuned for in-bed pose estimation by re-training its specific intermediate layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.",2016,2017-11-03,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0027ccaf4960be6b6c3864513eee34b7a9c7b699

Clients who want to classify their data send them to a server that performs their inference using a trained model. The client must trust the server and provide the data in plaintext. Moreover, if the classification is done at a third-party cloud service, the model owner also needs to trust the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privately evaluating decision trees. The protocol uses a novel private comparison function based on fully homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) scheme and a programmable bootstrapping technique. Our comparison function for 32-bit and 64-bit integers is 26% faster than the naive TFHE implementation. The protocol is designed to be non-interactive and is less complex than the existing interactive protocols. Our experiment results show that our technique scales linearly with the depth of the decision tree and efficiently evaluates large decision trees on real datasets.

Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are used to inform citizens about the political stances of the parties that involved in the upcoming elections, in an effort to facilitate their decision making process and increase their participation in this democratic process. VAA is a Web application that calls the users and parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, which are based on the current affairs of their country and then it recommends to each user the party that better fits their political views. SVAAs, a social recommendation approach of VAAs, on the other hand, base their recommendation on the VAA community of users in a collaborative filtering manner. In this paper we resort to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of SVAAs. In particular, we try to model party-supporters using HMMs and then use these models to recommend each VAA user the party whose model best fits his/her answer sequence of the VAA policy statements. HMMs proved to be effective machine learning tools for sequential and correlated data and this is the main rationale behind this study. VAA policy statements are usually correlated and grouped into categories such as external policy, economy, society, etc. As a result, opting from the various answer choices in each policy statement might be related with selections in previous and subsequent policy statements. Given that the order of policy statements is kept fixed within each VAA one can assume that (a) answer patterns (sequences of choices for all policy statements included in the VAA) can be found that characterise ‘typical’ voters of particular parties, and (b) the answer choice in each policy statement can be ‘predicted’ from previous answer choices.

Given the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges of employing children, young adults (18–40) can serve as suitable substitutes due to the similarity in their taste sensitivity. Taste panellists need not be experts in sensory evaluation so long as a reference product is used during evaluation; however, they should be screened for bitterness taste detection thresholds. For a more robust evaluation during the developmental phase, considerations of a scoring system and the calculation of an acceptance value may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of recommending a formulation for further development. On the technological front, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be exploited in taste-masking optimisation of medicinal formulations as they can model complex relationships between variables and enable predictions not possible previously to optimise product profiles. Machine learning classifiers may therefore tackle the challenge of predicting the bitterness intensity of paediatric formulations. While advancements have been made, further work is needed to identify effective taste-masking techniques for specific drug molecules. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms, using human panellist acceptability scores, can aid in enhancing paediatric formulation development and overcoming taste-masking challenges.",2022,2023-08-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028a595d2a9cfdd693befc5939764d4d087da6d

Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid separation)–residue positions distant in sequence, but in close proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL::Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models folded was reduced by an average of 2 Å for a benchmark of 25 membrane proteins.",2016,2017-05-24,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028cd710f4cbed5a4724a187a088694574af08d

Methods A systematic search was conducted in ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts from July 2005 to May 2022. Machine learning approaches, including modified Lasso penalized regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were applied to identify hub ARGs, thereby developing a prediction model termed ARG classifier. Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the model was comprehensively analyzed using multi-transcriptome data. Subsequently, we systematically correlated the ARG classifier/hub ARGs with immunological characteristics of multiple aspects, including immune cell infiltration, immune and molecular pathways, cytokine levels, and immune-related genes. Further, we collected clinical specimens to preliminarily investigate ARG expression levels and to assess the diagnostic performance of ARG classifier. Results A total of ten GEO and three ArrayExpress datasets were included in this study. Based on machine learning algorithms, eight key ARGs (ATG4C, BAX, BIRC5, ERBB2, FKBP1B, HIF1A, NCKAP1, and NFKB1) were integrated to establish ARG classifier. The model exhibited excellent diagnostic values (AUC > 0.85) in multiple datasets and multiple points in time and superiorly distinguished sepsis from other critical illnesses. ARG classifier showed significant correlations with clinical characteristics or endotypes and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.70) than other clinical characteristics. Additionally, the identified hub ARGs were significantly associated with immune cell infiltration (B, T, NK, dendritic, T regulatory, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), immune and molecular pathways (inflammation-promoting pathways, HLA, cytolytic activity, apoptosis, type-II IFN response, complement and coagulation cascades), levels of several cytokines (PDGFRB, IL-10, IFNG, and TNF), which indicated that ARG classifier/hub ARGs adequately reflected the immune microenvironment during sepsis. Finally, using clinical specimens, the expression levels of key ARGs in patients with sepsis were found to differ significantly from those of control patients, and ARG classifier exhibited superior diagnostic performance, compared to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion Collectively, a diagnostic and prognostic model (ARG classifier) based on eight ARGs was developed which may assist clinicians in diagnosis of sepsis and recognizing patient at high risk to guide personalized treatment. Additionally, the ARG classifier effectively reflected the immune microenvironment diversity of sepsis and may facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",2021,2022-11-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028df26e5831b753f7ae8cdafb379cbd4e78165

202210.1186/s13034-022-00554-y,2022 Conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 guideline adherence in adolescent psychiatric outpatients: the predictive role of adverse childhood experiences,"Background Conspiracy beliefs have become widespread throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have shown that endorsing conspiracy beliefs leads to lower protective guideline adherence (i.e., wearing face masks), posing a threat to public health measures. The current study expands this research across the lifespan, i.e., in a sample of adolescents with mental health problems. Here, we investigated the association between conspiracy beliefs and guideline adherence while also exploring the predictors of conspiracy beliefs. Methods N  = 93 adolescent psychiatric outpatients (57% female, mean age: 15.8) were assessed using anonymous paper–pencil questionnaires. Endorsement of generic and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was assessed, in addition to items measuring adherence to protective guidelines and mental health (stress, depressive symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and adverse childhood experiences). Multiple regressions and supervised machine learning (conditional random forests) were used for analyses. Results Fourteen percent of our sample fully endorsed at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory, while protective guidelines adherence was relatively high ( M  = 4.92, on a scale from 1 to 7). The endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs—but not of generic conspiracy beliefs—was associated with lower guideline adherence (β = − 0.32, 95% CI − 0.53 to − 0.11, p  < .001). Conditional random forests suggested that adverse childhood experiences and peer and conduct problems were relevant predictors of both conspiracy belief categories. Conclusion While a significant proportion of our sample of adolescents in psychiatric treatment endorsed conspiracy beliefs, the majority did not. Furthermore, and to some degree, contrary to public perception, we found that adolescents show relatively good adherence to public health measures—even while experiencing a high degree of mental distress. The predictive value of adverse childhood experiences and peer/conduct problems for conspiracy beliefs might be explained by compensatory mechanisms to ensure the safety, structure, and inclusion that conspiracies provide.",2022,2023-01-24,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028eee468b54f20eb190af8787a38199daa24bd

Experiment shows, that our proffered daily activeness-based recommendation system using smartphone sensor data, performs with a precision of 66%, but it is also a promising performance because it does not use customers' explicit feedback.",2020,2022-08-31,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0029b6d7f583e0705d1cb9dc16a33bb12a995ad6

202010.46792/fuoyejet.v6i2.609,2020 Intelligent Citizenship Identity Through Family Pedigree Using Graph-Signature Based Random-Forest Model,"There has been a global upsurge of interest in the topic of citizenship identity over the past decades, specifically in the world dominated by profound insecurity, inequalities, proliferation of identities, and rise of identity politics,engendered by capitalism. However finding effective solution to these problems has been rendered difficult. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents an analytical Machine learning model that suitably combined the graph signature with random forest techniques. This study presents the design and realization of a novel Intelligent Citizenship Identity through family pedigree using Graph Signature based random forest (GSB-RF) model. The study also showcases the development of a novel graph signature technique referred to as Canonical Code Signature(CCS) method. The CCS method is used at the pre-processing stage of the identification process to build signature for any given tuple. Performance comparisim between the present system and the baseline techniques which includes: the K-Nearest Neighbour and the traditional Random Forest shows that the present system outperformed the baseline method studied. The proposed system shows capability to perform continuous re-identification of Citizens based on their family pedigree with ability to select best sample with low computational complexity, high identification accuracy and speed. Our experimental result shows that the precision rate and identification quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%. Therefore, the proposed Citizenship Identification machine is capable of providing usable, consistent, efficient, faster and accurate identification, to the users, security agents, government agents and institutions on-line, real-time and at any-time.Keywords- Canonical code,Citizenship Identity, Family pedigree,Graph-Signature,Machine learning, Random-forest",2020,2021-06-29,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002a1faea8e778716839dfae54dbd1d2ca54f1df

202010.1371/journal.pone.0283933,2020 Application of quantum computing to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model for novel medical knowledge discovery,"Recently, the utilization of real-world medical data collected from clinical sites has been attracting attention. Especially as the number of variables in real-world medical data increases, causal discovery becomes more and more effective. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop new causal discovery algorithms suitable for small data sets for situations where sample sizes are insufficient to detect reasonable causal relationships, such as rare diseases and emerging infectious diseases. This study aims to develop a new causal discovery algorithm suitable for a small number of real-world medical data using quantum computing, one of the emerging information technologies attracting attention for its application in machine learning. In this study, a new algorithm that applies the quantum kernel to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, one of the causal discovery algorithms, is developed. Experiments on several artificial data sets showed that the new algorithm proposed in this study was more accurate than existing methods with the Gaussian kernel under various conditions in the low-data regime. When the new algorithm was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which the causal structure could be correctly estimated even when the amount of data was small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing the new algorithm on real quantum hardware was discussed. This study suggests that the new proposed algorithm using quantum computing might be a good choice among the causal discovery algorithms in the low-data regime for novel medical knowledge discovery.",2020,2021-10-09,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002acb7f6823d4b486a6865b18238c2fcc520333

Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom.

202310.1080/0886022X.2024.2315298,2023 Machine learning algorithm for predict the in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with congestive heart failure combined with chronic kidney disease,"Abstract Background The objective of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for predict in-hospital mortality among critically ill patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) combined with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. Results This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm explains the individualized predictions. Conclusions In conclusion, our study accomplished the successful development and validation of ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with CHF combined with CKD. Notably, the XGBoost model emerged as the most efficacious among all the ML models employed.",2023,2024-02-15,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002bec1532344bccbeb644a82dd58bcecab22bdc

The iCPH platform combines humanoid robots as “physical twins” of human and “digital twins” that simulates humans and robots in cyber-space. Several critical research topics are introduced to address this challenge by leveraging the advanced model-based analysis together with data-driven learning to exploit collected data from the integrated platform of iCPH. Definition of general description is identified as the first topic as a common basis of contact motions compatible to both humans and humanoids. Then, we set continual learning of a feasible contact motion network as the second challenge by benefiting from model-based approach and machine learning bridged by the efficient analytical gradient computation developed by the author and his collaborators. The final target is to establish a high-level symbolic system allowing automatic understanding and generation of contact motions in unexperienced environments.

When an object is placed on the metasurface, local changes can be detected in one or more of the structure’s meta-atoms.

We derive the properties of the structure and its behaviour in terms of superposition and demonstrate that observing the meta-surface from a single point is sufficient for unambiguous localisation and identification.

It creates an adverse impact on flyrock. Thus, it is essential to forecast flyrock to minimize the environmental effects. The objective of this study is to forecast/estimate the amount of flyrock produced during blasting by applying three creative composite intelligent models: equilibrium optimizer-coupled extreme learning machine (EO-ELM), particle swarm optimization-based extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). To obtain a successful conclusion, we considered 114 blasting data parameters consisting of eight inputs (hole diameter, burden, stemming length, rock density, charge-per-meter, powder factor (PF), blastability index (BI), and weathering index), and one output parameter (flyrock distance). We then compared the results of different models using seven different performance indices. Every predictive model accomplished the results comparable with the measured values of flyrock. To show the effectiveness of the developed EO-ELM, the result from each model run 10-times is compared.

We present outcome (‘recovered’, ‘isolated’ or ‘death’) risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over ‘early’ datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used ‘country’, ‘age’ and ‘gender’ as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient’s ‘disease’ history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results The use of a patient’s ‘disease’ history improves the prediction of ‘death’ by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent’s ‘disease’ history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient’s ‘disease’ history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions.

Therefore, it is vital to predict NAO events. Since the NAO event can be quantified by the NAO index, an effective neural network model EEMD-ConvLSTM, which is based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), is proposed for NAO index prediction in this paper. EEMD is applied to preprocess NAO index data, which are issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NAO index data are decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). After being filtered by the energy threshold, the remaining IMFs are used to reconstruct new NAO index data as the input of ConvLSTM. In order to evaluate the performance of EEMD-ConvLSTM, six methods were selected as the benchmark, which included traditional models, machine learning algorithms, and other deep neural networks.

Although different solutions have been exercised against phishing, phishing attacks have dramatically increased in the past few years. Recent studies have shown that machine learning has become prominent in the present anti-phishing context, and the techniques like deep learning have extensively improved anti-phishing tools’ detection ability. This paper proposes PhishDet, a new way of detecting phishing websites through Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network and Graph Convolutional Network using URL and HTML features. PhishDet is the first of its kind, which uses the powerful analysis and processing capabilities of Graph Neural Network in the anti-phishing domain and recorded 96.42% detection accuracy, with a 0.036 false-negative rate. It is effective against zero-day attacks, and the average detection time which is 1.8 seconds could also be considered realistic. The feature selection of PhishDet is automatic and occurs inside the system, as PhishDet gradually learns URLs and HTML content features to handle constantly changing phishing attacks. This has outperformed similar solutions by achieving a 99.53% f1-score with a public benchmark dataset. However, PhishDet requires periodic retraining to maintain its performance over time. If such retraining could be facilitated, PhishDet could fight against phishers for a more extended period to safeguard Internet users from this Internet threat.",2021,,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0031e9cbc9568967755617493f525eb852baad2b

202210.3390/app13116639,"2022 Analysis of the Composition of Ancient Glass and Its Identification Based on the Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM and MLR Combined Process","The glass relics are precious material evidence of the early trade and cultural exchange between the East and the West. To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit. In comparison with other similar types of models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF), the classification accuracy of JMLA is 97.9% on the train set.

The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs’ chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies.

The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed. The dataset and code used are publicly available on Mendeley Data and GitHub, respectively.",2021,2023-06-21,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00342ad7d5b47a585e1d802cabb2837d0c05c9a6

 With the emerging developments in millimeter-wave/5G technologies, the potential for wireless Internet of things devices to achieve widespread sensing, precise localization, and high data-rate communication systems becomes increasingly viable. The surge in interest surrounding virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies is attributed to the vast array of applications they enable, ranging from surgical training to motion capture and daily interactions in VR spaces. To further elevate the user experience, and real-time and accurate orientation detection of the user, the authors proposes the utilization of a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system coupled with an ultra-low-power, sticker-like millimeter-wave identification (mmID). The mmID features four backscattering elements, multiplexed in amplitude, frequency, and spatial domains. This design utilizes the training of a supervised learning classification convolutional neural network, enabling accurate real-time three-axis orientation detection of the user. The proposed orientation detection system exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 90.58% over three axes at a distance of 8 m. This high accuracy underscores the precision of the orientation detection system, particularly tailored for medium-range VR/AR applications. The integration of the FMCW-based mmID system with machine learning proves to be a promising advancement, contributing to the seamless and immersive interaction within virtual and augmented environments.",2023,2024-11-13,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00342bbadd38eb967ed257d8567b540d7270efa0

202010.1371/journal.pone.0255277,2020 Predicting pain among female survivors of recent interpersonal violence: A proof-of-concept machine-learning approach,"Interpersonal violence (IPV) is highly prevalent in the United States and is a major public health problem. The emergence and/or worsening of chronic pain are known sequelae of IPV; however, not all those who experience IPV develop chronic pain. To mitigate its development, it is critical to identify the factors that are associated with increased risk of pain after IPV. This proof-of-concept study used machine-learning strategies to predict pain severity and interference in 47 young women, ages 18 to 30, who experienced an incident of IPV (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) within three months of their baseline assessment. Young women are more likely than men to experience IPV and to subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Women completed a comprehensive assessment of theory-driven cognitive and neurobiological predictors of pain severity and pain-related interference (e.g., pain, coping, disability, psychiatric diagnosis/symptoms, PTSD/trauma, executive function, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress response). Gradient boosting machine models were used to predict symptoms of pain severity and pain-related interference across time (Baseline, 1-,3-,6- follow-up assessments). Models showed excellent predictive performance for pain severity and adequate predictive performance for pain-related interference. This proof-of-concept study suggests that machine-learning approaches are a useful tool for identifying predictors of pain development in survivors of recent IPV. Baseline measures of pain, family life impairment, neuropsychological function, and trauma history were of greatest importance in predicting pain and pain-related interference across a 6-month follow-up period. Present findings support the use of machine-learning techniques in larger studies of post-IPV pain development and highlight theory-driven predictors that could inform the development of targeted early intervention programs. However, these results should be replicated in a larger dataset with lower levels of missing data.",2020,2021-07-29,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0035763f80fd126ad0d99dd1b964dae9c1986d39

202410.1155/vmi/5585458,2024 Machine Learning Techniques Associated With Infrared Thermography to Optimize the Diagnosis of Bovine Subclinical Mastitis,"Bovine subclinical mastitis (SCM) is the costliest disease for the dairy industry. Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14 months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000 cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.",2024,2025-01-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00360aaf2043b43dac356cba6e834e6b30188907

Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.",2023,2025-01-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00360aaf2043b43dac356cba6e834e6b30188907

202210.7759/cureus.42668,2022 Predictive Factors for High Post-void Residual Volume in Older Females After OnabotulinumA Treatment for Severe Overactive Bladder Using a Machine Learning Model,"Introduction Intravesical onabotulinumA injection is actively used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume. The findings contribute to our understanding of onabotulinumA injection treatment for OAB and support evidence-based decision-making using readily available information.",2022,2023-07-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003653221d742282482d1a3df6927f69763b47aa

Although formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are deemed crucial for research and clinical applications, the fixation process results in molecular damage to nucleic acids, thus confounding their use in genome sequence analysis. Methods to improve genomic data quality from FFPE tissues have emerged, but there remains significant room for improvement. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from matched Fresh Frozen (FF) and FFPE tissue samples to optimize a sensitive and precise FFPE single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling approach. We present methods to reduce the prevalence of false-positive SNVs by applying combinatorial techniques to five publicly available variant callers. We also introduce FFPolish, a novel variant classification method that efficiently classifies FFPE-specific false-positive variants. Our combinatorial and statistical techniques improve precision and F1 scores compared to the results of publicly available tools when tested individually.",2021,2022-04-27,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0039303644246458baa4ba8dead9e1f98573c020

202010.1038/s41431-021-00996-6,2020 A summary-statistics-based approach to examine the role of serotonin transporter promoter tandem repeat polymorphism in psychiatric phenotypes,"In genetic studies of psychiatric disorders in the pre-genome-wide association study (GWAS) era, one of the most commonly studied loci is the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) promoter polymorphism, a 43-base-pair insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The genetic association signals between 5-HTTLPR and psychiatric phenotypes, however, have been inconsistent across many studies. Since the polymorphism cannot be tested via available SNP arrays, we had previously proposed an efficient machine learning algorithm to predict the genotypes of 5-HTTLPR based on the genotypes of eight nearby SNPs, which requires access to individual-level genotype and phenotype data. To utilize the advantage of publicly available GWAS summary statistics obtained from studies with very large sample sizes, we develop a GWAS summary-statistics-based approach for testing the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) associations with various phenotypes. We first cross-verify the accuracy of the summary-statistics-based approach for 61 phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Since we observed a strong similarity between the predicted individual-level 5-HTTLPR genotype-based approach and the summary-statistics-based approach, we applied our method to the available neurobehavioral GWAS summary statistics data obtained from large-scale GWAS. We found no genome-wide significant evidence for association between 5-HTTLPR and any of the neurobehavioral traits. We did observe, however, genome-wide significant evidence for association between this locus and human adult height, BMI, and total cholesterol. Our summary-statistics-based approach provides a systematic way to examine the role of VNTRs and related types of genetic polymorphisms in disease risk and trait susceptibility of phenotypes for which large-scale GWAS summary statistics data are available.",2020,2021-12-23,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003996f234a21693d79a8165b094f4def8550b60

First, providing adequate reasons is a significant facet of respecting individuals’ agency. Incorporating inscrutable algorithmic predictions into administrative decision‐making compromises this normative ideal. Second, as a long‐term concern, the use of inscrutable algorithms by administrative agencies may generate systemic effects by gradually reducing the realm of the humanly explainable in public life, a phenomenon Max Weber termed ‘re‐enchantment’.

The Jucazinho Dam, built in 1998, emerged as a response to the scarcity of water in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil. After having less than 1% of its water storage capacity in 2016, the dam recovered in 2020 after interventions by the local water utility. In this context, the reliability of influent flow prediction models for dams becomes crucial for managers. This study proposed hydrological models based on artificial intelligence that aim to generate flow series, and we evaluated the adaptability of these models for the operation of the Jucazinho Dam. Data normalization between 0 and 1 was applied to avoid the predominance of variables with high values. The model was based on machine learning and employed support vector regression (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), as provided by the Python Sklearn library. The selection of the monitoring stations took place via the Brazilian National Water and Sanitation Agency’s (ANA) HIDROWEB portal, and we used Spearman’s correlation to identify the relationship between precipitation and flow. The evaluation of the performance of the model involved graphical analyses and statistical criteria such as the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the percentage of bias (PBIAS), the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean standard deviation ratio (RSR). The results of the statistical coefficients for the test data indicated unsatisfactory performance for long-term predictions (8, 16 and 32 days ahead), revealing a downward trend in the quality of the fit with an increase in the forecast horizon. The SVM model stood out by obtaining the best indices of NSE, PBIAS, R2 and RSR. The graphical results of the SVM models showed underestimation of the flow values with an increase in the forecast horizon due to the sensitivity of the SVM to complex patterns in the time series. On the other hand, the RF and ANN models showed hyperestimation of the flow values as the number of forecast days increased, which was mainly attributed to overfitting. In summary, this study highlights the relevance of artificial intelligence in flow prediction for the efficient management of dams, especially in water scarcity and data-scarce scenarios. A proper choice of models and the ensuring of reliable input data are crucial for obtaining accurate forecasts and can contribute to water security and the effective operation of dams such as Jucazinho.",2023,2024-07-04,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003b1449565f0afd675b7fb59f35693776eb2c77

201710.2196/12116,2017 Measuring Caloric Intake at the Population Level (NOTION): Protocol for an Experimental Study,"Background The monitoring of caloric intake is an important challenge for the maintenance of individual and public health. The instruments used so far for dietary monitoring (eg, food frequency questionnaires, food diaries, and telephone interviews) are inexpensive and easy to implement but show important inaccuracies. Alternative methods based on wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated from these types of devices. Objective This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable estimate of caloric intake. Methods The study will capture four individual eating activities outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email, flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the University of Padova. Results The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high accuracy. Conclusions Building an automatic calculation method for caloric intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg, for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different segments of the population.

Despite the growing knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction and ulcerative colitis (UC), the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in UC remains to be fully explored. Methods We integrated 1137 UC colon mucosal samples from 12 multicenter cohorts worldwide to create a normalized compendium. Differentially expressed mitochondria-related genes (DE-MiRGs) in individuals with UC were identified using the “Limma” R package. Unsupervised consensus clustering was utilized to determine the intrinsic subtypes of UC driven by DE-MiRGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to investigate module genes related to UC. Four machine learning algorithms were utilized for screening DE-MiRGs in UC and construct MiRGs diagnostic models. The models were developed utilizing the over-sampled training cohort, followed by validation in both the internal test cohort and the external validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Xcell and CIBERSORT algorithms, while potential biological mechanisms were explored through GSVA and GSEA algorithms. Hub genes were selected using the PPI network. Results The study identified 108 DE-MiRGs in the colonic mucosa of patients with UC compared to healthy controls, showing significant enrichment in pathways associated with mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation. The MiRGs diagnostic models for UC were constructed based on 17 signature genes identified through various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities. Utilizing the identified DE-MiRGs from the normalized compendium, 941 patients with UC were stratified into three subtypes characterized by distinct cellular and molecular profiles. Specifically, the metabolic subtype demonstrated enrichment in epithelial cells, the immune-inflamed subtype displayed high enrichment in antigen-presenting cells and pathways related to pro-inflammatory activation, and the transitional subtype exhibited moderate activation across all signaling pathways. Importantly, the immune-inflamed subtype exhibited a stronger correlation with superior response to four biologics: infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and golimumab compared to the metabolic subtype. Conclusion This analysis unveils the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune microenvironment in UC, thereby offering novel perspectives on the potential pathogenesis of UC and precision treatment of UC patients, and identifying new therapeutic targets.",2023,2024-07-04,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003e31ab99c90e5720ecd5fd6d74e672b887876c
202210.3389/fimmu.2024.1396221,2022 Precision therapy for ulcerative colitis: insights from mitochondrial dysfunction interacting with the immune microenvironment,"Background Accumulating evidence reveals mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbates intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation. Despite the growing knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction and ulcerative colitis (UC), the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in UC remains to be fully explored. Methods We integrated 1137 UC colon mucosal samples from 12 multicenter cohorts worldwide to create a normalized compendium. Differentially expressed mitochondria-related genes (DE-MiRGs) in individuals with UC were identified using the “Limma” R package. Unsupervised consensus clustering was utilized to determine the intrinsic subtypes of UC driven by DE-MiRGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to investigate module genes related to UC. Four machine learning algorithms were utilized for screening DE-MiRGs in UC and construct MiRGs diagnostic models. The models were developed utilizing the over-sampled training cohort, followed by validation in both the internal test cohort and the external validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Xcell and CIBERSORT algorithms, while potential biological mechanisms were explored through GSVA and GSEA algorithms.

201810.3390/s21144770,2018 Unsupervised Assessment of Balance and Falls Risk Using a Smartphone and Machine Learning,"Assessment of health and physical function using smartphones (mHealth) has enormous potential due to the ubiquity of smartphones and their potential to provide low cost, scalable access to care as well as frequent, objective measurements, outside of clinical environments. Validation of the algorithms and outcome measures used by mHealth apps is of paramount importance, as poorly validated apps have been found to be harmful to patients. Falls are a complex, common and costly problem in the older adult population. Deficits in balance and postural control are strongly associated with falls risk. Assessment of balance and falls risk using a validated smartphone app may lessen the need for clinical assessments which can be expensive, requiring non-portable equipment and specialist expertise.

As the sophistication of malware continues to increase, the demand for innovative approaches to improve detection capabilities become paramount. Machine learning/Deep learning models are being increasingly used for Malware Detection, however one of the most important and frequently overlooked aspects of building such models is feature encoding. This research paper explores the importance of feature encoding to improve the efficiency of threat detection and proposes a novel entropy-based encoding scheme for the categorical features present in the data extracted from malicious inputs. The KDDCUP99, UNSW-NB15 and CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 datasets have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encoding scheme. The results of the proposed encoding scheme are validated against seven other encoding schemes to ascertain the credibility and usability of the proposed scheme. The efficiency of the proposed system evaluated by applying different encoded versions of the datasets to train various machine learning models and determining the classification performance of the models on each dataset. The machine learning models trained with the proposed encoding scheme produced stable classification results and outperformed other encoding schemes when dimensionality reduction was applied on the data. The ensemble classifier trained using the proposed scheme was able to classify the data with an F1 score of 99.99% when the dimension-reduced entropy-encoded KDD Cup99 dataset was used to build the model. On the CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 dataset, the entropy encoding has exhibited a slightly improved classification parameters with the ensemble methods yielding a peak F1 score of 99.27%. We have also determined the feature importance values of the features present in the datasets to study the change in the contribution levels of the features when multiple categorical encoding schemes are applied upon the data.",2023,,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00400e2514bc0e41323ddf7beb1bec5ab2516b82

202110.1186/s12873-022-00610-y,2021 “Decision tree analysis for assessing the risk of post-traumatic haemorrhage after mild traumatic brain injury in patients on oral anticoagulant therapy”,"Background The presence of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) alone, regardless of patient condition, is an indication for CT imaging in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Currently, no specific clinical decision rules are available for OAT patients. The aim of the study was to identify which clinical risk factors easily identifiable at first ED evaluation may be associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in OAT patients who suffered an MTBI. Methods Three thousand fifty-four patients in OAT with MTBI from four Italian centers were retrospectively considered. A decision tree analysis using the classification and regression tree (CART) method was conducted to evaluate both the pre- and post-traumatic clinical risk factors most associated with the presence of post-traumatic ICH after MTBI and their possible role in determining the patient’s risk. The decision tree analysis used all clinical risk factors identified at the first ED evaluation as input predictor variables. Results ICH following MTBI was present in 9.5% of patients (290/3054). The CART model created a decision tree using 5 risk factors, post-traumatic amnesia, post-traumatic transitory loss of consciousness, greater trauma dynamic, GCS less than 15, evidence of trauma above the clavicles, capable of stratifying patients into different increasing levels of ICH risk (from 2.5 to 61.4%). The absence of concussion and neurological alteration at admission appears to significantly reduce the possible presence of ICH. Conclusions The machine-learning-based CART model identified distinct prognostic groups of patients with distinct outcomes according to on clinical risk factors. Decision trees can be useful as guidance in patient selection and risk stratification of patients in OAT with MTBI.",2021,2022-03-24,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0040c11db2f3787dd6eaba009ab989833cd491de

202010.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074559,2020 From Big Data to Deep Data to Support People Analytics for Employee Attrition Prediction,"In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking ‘big’ by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking ‘deep’ by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that ‘business travel’, which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.",2020,,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0040fbc24133d560c7de163f4bd7a32e07f9fd1e

202110.3390/en15186791,2021 Gender Aspects in Driving Style and Its Impact on Battery Ageing,"The long and tiring discussion of who are the best drivers, men or women, is not answered in this article. This article, though, sheds some light on the actual differences that can be seen in how men and women drive. In this study, GPS-recorded driving dynamics data from 123 drivers, 48 women and 75 men, are analysed and drivers are categorised as aggressive, normal or gentle. A total of 10% of the drivers was categorised as aggressive, with an even distribution between the genders. For the gentle drivers, 11% of the drivers, the men dominated. The driving style investigation was extended to utilise machine learning, confirming the results from statistical tools. As driving style highly impacts a vehicle’s fuel consumption, while switching over to battery electric vehicles it is important to investigate how the different driving styles impact battery utilisation. Two Li-ion battery cell types were tested utilising the same load cycle with three levels of current amplitude, to represent accelerations for the three drive categories. While one cell type was insensitive to the current amplitude, the highly energy-optimised cell proved to be sensitive to higher current amplitudes, corresponding to a more aggressive driving style. Thus, the amplitude of the dynamic current can for some cells be a factor that needs to be considered for lifetime predictions, while it can be neglected for other cells.",2021,2022-09-16,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0042c8b6e5e509c1b19eca934fe8bb01a16c1d7a

Diagnostic errors are an underappreciated cause of preventable mortality in hospitals and pose a risk for severe patient harm and increase hospital length of stay.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to explore the potential of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in improving diagnostic safety surveillance. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of the feasibility and potential to use electronic health records clinical notes and existing case review data.


METHODS
Safety Learning System case review data from 1 large health system composed of 10 hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from February 2016 to September 2021 were analyzed. The case review outcome included opportunities for improvement including diagnostic opportunities for improvement. To supplement case review data, electronic health record clinical notes were extracted and analyzed. A simple logistic regression model along with 3 forms of logistic regression models (ie, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Ridge, and Elastic Net) with regularization functions was trained on this data to compare classification performances in classifying patients who experienced diagnostic errors during hospitalization. Further, statistical tests were conducted to find significant differences between female and male patients who experienced diagnostic errors.


RESULTS
In total, 126 (7.4%) patients (of 1704) had been identified by case reviewers as having experienced at least 1 diagnostic error. Patients who had experienced diagnostic error were grouped by sex: 59 (7.1%) of the 830 women and 67 (7.7%) of the 874 men. Among the patients who experienced a diagnostic error, female patients were older (median 72, IQR 66-80 vs median 67, IQR 57-76; P=.02), had higher rates of being admitted through general or internal medicine (69.5% vs 47.8%; P=.01), lower rates of cardiovascular-related admitted diagnosis (11.9% vs 28.4%; P=.02), and lower rates of being admitted through neurology department (2.3% vs 13.4%; P=.04). The Ridge model achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.885), specificity (0.797), positive predictive value (PPV; 0.24), and F1-score (0.369) in classifying patients who were at higher risk of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients.

Remote monitoring frameworks for disease detection at an early stage are opposed by most conventional works. Even so, it ran into issues like increased operational complexity, higher resource costs, inaccurate predictions, longer data collection times, and a lower convergence rate. A remote health monitoring framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict heart disease and diabetes from medical datasets is the goal of this project. Patients' health data is collected via smart devices, and the resulting data is then combined using a variety of nodes, including a detection node, a visualisation node, and a prognostic node. People with long-term illnesses (such as the elderly and disabled) are in such greater demand than ever before that a new approach to healthcare delivery is essential. In the evolved paradigm, conventional physical medical services foundations like clinics, nursing homes, and long haul care offices will be old. Due to recent advancements in modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the smart healthcare system has become increasingly necessary (ML). This paper will discuss wearable and smartphone technologies, AI for medical diagnostics, and assistive structures, including social robots, that have been created for the surrounding upheld living climate.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT. Materials and Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I–II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors. Results Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794–0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873–0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789–0.915), respectively.

202210.3389/fneur.2023.1189076,2022 Experimental verification and identifying biomarkers related to insomnia,"Introduction Insomnia is the most common form of sleep deprivation (SD) observed in clinics. Although there are differences between insomnia and SD, they have similar symptoms and the same animal model. Currently, there is a lack of microarray data on insomnia. Therefore, for now, we are going to apply the SD data to insomnia. Although many studies have explained the possible mechanisms associated with insomnia, no previous studies have considered the key genes associated with insomnia or the relationship between insomnia and immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between key genes and immune cells by identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of insomnia. Next, we verified the efficacy of these biomarkers experimentally. Methods First, we downloaded four microarrays (GSE11755, GSE12624, GSE28750, and GSE48080) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 239 normal human blood samples and 365 blood specimens from patients with SD. Then, we analyzed two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model to investigate these key genes. Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not. Discussion In summary, we identified a key gene (C2CD2L) that may facilitate the development of biomarkers for insomnia.",2022,2023-11-28,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00471583b7d751fc7043be63f18eaa4b25985bec

Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not. Discussion In summary, we identified a key gene (C2CD2L) that may facilitate the development of biomarkers for insomnia.",2021,2023-11-28,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00471583b7d751fc7043be63f18eaa4b25985bec

202110.1371/journal.pcbi.1011010,2021 Combining phylogeny and coevolution improves the inference of interaction partners among paralogous proteins,"Predicting protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important goal of computational biology. Various sources of information can be used to this end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of sequences is modest. Author summary When two protein families interact, their sequences feature statistical dependencies. First, interacting proteins tend to share a common evolutionary history. Second, maintaining structure and interactions through the course of evolution yields coevolution, detectable via correlations in the amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",2021,2022-08-24,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0047d0cad12b452bb9d27d81105380f589085199

202210.1063/5.0126358,2022 Recent trends in marine microplastic modeling and machine learning tools: Potential for long-term microplastic monitoring,"The increase in the global demand for plastics, and more recently during the pandemic, is a major concern for the future of plastic waste pollution and microplastics. Efficient microplastic monitoring is imperative to understanding the long-term effects and progression of microplastic effects in the environment. Numerical models are valuable in studying microplastic transport as they can be used to examine the effects of different parameters systematically to help elucidate the fate and transport processes of microplastics, thus providing a holistic view of microplastics in the ocean environment. By incorporating physical parameters (such as size, shape, density, and identity of microplastics), numerical models have gained better understanding of the physics of microplastic transport, predicted sinking velocities more accurately, and estimated microplastic pathways in marine environments. However, availability of large amounts of information about microplastic physical and chemical parameters is sparse. Machine learning and computer-vision tools can aid in acquiring environmental information and provide input to develop more accurate models and verify their predictions. More accurate models can further the understanding of microplastic transport, facilitate monitoring efforts, and thus optimize where more data collection can take place to ultimately improve machine learning tools. This review offers a perspective on how image-based machine learning can be exploited to help uncover the physics of microplastic transport behaviors.

201810.14569/IJACSA.2019.0100374,2018 Performance Analysis of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Models in Week-Ahead Rainfall Forecasting,"Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is considered as one of the most efficient forecasting techniques which can be implemented for the prediction of weather occurrence. As with any machine learning implementation, the challenge on the utilization of MLPNN in rainfall forecasting lies in the development and evaluation of MLPNN models which delivers optimal forecasting performance. This research conducted performance analysis of MLPNN models through data preparation, model designing, and model evaluation in order to determine which parameters are the best-fit configurations for MLPNN model implementation in rainfall forecasting. During rainfall data preparation, imputation process and spatial correlation evaluation of weather variables from various weather stations showed that the geographical location of the chosen weather stations did not have a direct correlation between stations with respect to rainfall behavior leading to the decision of utilizing the weather station having the most complete weather data to be fed in the MLPNN. By conducting performance analysis of MLPNN models with different combinations of training algorithms, activation functions, learning rate, and momentum, it was found out that MLPNN model having 100 hidden neurons with Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm and Sigmoid activation function delivered the lowest RMSE of 0.031537 while another MLPNN model having the same number of hidden neurons, the same activation function but Resilient Propagation as training algorithm had the lowest MAE of 0.0209. The results of this research showed that performance analysis of MLPNN models is a crucial process in model implementation of MLPNN for week-ahead rainfall forecasting.",2018,,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004908d4eefcadb6eb44c644179f20154a1345a7

With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding. Methods The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit ≥ 18 years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features ( n  = 88) were selected with clinicians’ input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in > 0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. Results There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632–0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs.

The method for developing recommendations based on collaborative filtering such as Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and hybrid methods of Machine Learning (ML) has been improved. The paper describes the design principles and functional requirements to a recommendation system in the form of a Web application for choosing the content required by user using movies as an example. The research has focused on solving issues related to cold start and scalability within the method of collaborative filtering. To effectively address these tasks, we have used hybrid training methods. A hybrid recommendation system (HRS) has been practically implemented for providing relevant content recommendations using movies as an example, taking into consideration the user's personal preferences based on the constructed hybrid method. We have improved an algorithm for developing content recommendations based on the collaborative filtering and Machine Learning for the combined filtration of similarity indicators among users or goods. The hybrid algorithm receives initial information in a different form, normalizes it, and generates relevant recommendations based on a combination of CF and CBF methods. Machine Learning is capable of defining those factors that influence the selection of relevant films, which improves development of recommendations specific to the user. To solve these tasks, a new improved method has been proposed, underlying which, in contrast to existing systems of recommendations, are the hybrid methods and Machine Learning. Machine Learning data for the designed HRS were borrowed from MovieLens. We have analyzed methods for developing recommendations to the user; existing recommendation systems have been reviewed. Our experimental results demonstrate that the operational indicators for the proposed HRS, based on the technology of CF+CBF+ML, outperform those for two individual models, CF and CBF, and such their combinations as CF CBF, CF+ML, and CBF+ML.

Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2 mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively.

201610.2196/jmir.6887,2016 Enhancing Comparative Effectiveness Research With Automated Pediatric Pneumonia Detection in a Multi-Institutional Clinical Repository: A PHIS+ Pilot Study,"Background Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity. Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. Methods The multi-institutional PHIS+ clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children’s hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Results Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity . Conclusions NLP-based pneumonia information extraction of pediatric diagnostic imaging reports performed better than domain experts in this pilot study. NLP is an efficient method to extract information from a large collection of imaging reports to facilitate CER.",2016,2017-05-01,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004b6bec13e8bb316746b9b768ff2df34e8f62b5

However, they have strong relations since a longer processing time triggers a change in schedule. Although promising approaches already exist for mapping the influence of manufacturing processes on production scheduling, the variability of the production environment, including changing process conditions, technological parameters and the status of current orders, is usually ignored. For this reason, this paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that adaptively refines the production schedule by applying Machine Learning (ML)-models during the manufacturing process in order to predict the process-dependent parameters that influence the schedule. With the proper prediction of these parameters based on the process conditions, the production schedule is proactively adjusted to changing conditions not only to ensure the sufficient product quality but also to reduce the negative effects and losses that delayed rescheduling would cause. The proposed approach aims on minimizing the overall lateness by utilizing an active data exchange between the scheduling system and the predictive ML-models on the process level.

Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects.

202210.1007/s10676-023-09734-6,2022 Can machine learning make naturalism about health truly naturalistic? A reflection on a data-driven concept of health,"Through hypothetical scenarios, this paper analyses whether machine learning (ML) could resolve one of the main shortcomings present in Christopher Boorse’s Biostatistical Theory of health (BST). In doing so, it foregrounds the boundaries and challenges of employing ML in formulating a naturalist (i.e., prima facie value-free) definition of health. The paper argues that a sweeping dataist approach cannot fully make the BST truly naturalistic, as prior theories and values persist. It also points out that supervised learning introduces circularity, rendering it incompatible with a naturalistic perspective. Additionally, it underscores the need for pre-existing auxiliary theories to assess results from unsupervised learning. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the epistemological entanglements between data and data processing methods to manage expectations about what data patterns can predict. In conclusion, the paper argues against delegating the final authority for defining complex concepts like health to AI systems, as it necessitates ethical judgment and capacities for deliberation that AI currently lacks. It also warns against granting creators and deployers of AI systems the discretionary authority to determine these definitions outside the wider social discussion, advocating for ongoing public engagement on normative notions.

202110.3847/1538-4357/acad79,2021 Using Machine Learning to Determine Morphologies of z < 1 AGN Host Galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Wide Survey,"We present a machine-learning framework to accurately characterize the morphologies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within z < 1. We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), and high (0.5 < z < 1.0). By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for ∼60%–70% of the host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of ∼80%–95%, depending on the redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve a disk precision of 96%/82%/79% and bulge precision of 90%/90%/80% (for the three redshift bins) at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of 30%/43%/42%. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging surveys.",2021,2022-12-20,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c9375fc25383cc6c0e47e28b2eba73002696d

202110.3390/en15113895,2021 Projecting the Thermal Response in a HTGR-Type System during Conduction Cooldown Using Graph-Laplacian Based Machine Learning,"Accurate prediction of an off-normal event in a nuclear reactor is dependent upon the availability of sensory data, reactor core physical condition, and understanding of the underlying phenomenon. This work presents a method to project the data from some discrete sensory locations to the overall reactor domain during conduction cooldown scenarios similar to High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). The existing models for conductive cooldown in a heterogeneous multi-body system, such as an assembly of prismatic blocks or pebble beds relies on knowledge of the thermal contact conductance, requiring significant knowledge of local thermal contacts and heat transport possibilities across those contacts. With a priori knowledge of bulk geometry features and some discrete sensors, a machine learning approach was devised. The presented work uses an experimental facility to mimic conduction cooldown with an assembly of 68 cylindrical rods initially heated to 1200 K. High-fidelity temperature data were collected using an infrared (IR) camera to provide training data to the model and validate the predicted temperature data. The machine learning approach used here first converts the macroscopic bulk geometry information into Graph-Laplacian, and then uses the eigenvectors of the Graph-Laplacian to develop Kernel functions. Support vector regression (SVR) was implemented on the obtained Kernels and used to predict the thermal response in a packed rod assembly during a conduction cooldown experiment. The usage of SVR modeling differs from most models today because of its representation of thermal coupling between rods in the core. When trained with thermographic data, the average normalized error is less than 2% over 400 s, during which temperatures of the assembly have dropped by more than 500 K. The rod temperature prediction performance was significantly better for rods in the interior of the assembly compared to those near the exterior, likely due to the model simplification of the surroundings.",2021,2022-05-25,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c9f94e112605e0cae7497d8a31e2d44ee0c10

202410.12720/jait.16.3.396-410,2024 Robust Approach to Improve Link Prediction Accuracy in Directed Social Networks Based on Ensemble Learning Models and Advanced Feature Extraction Techniques,"—Link prediction is a significant field in network science, which focuses on predicting the probability of the existence or formation of a link between nodes in a social network based on currently observed connections. Recently, several efficient link prediction algorithms have been developed, demonstrating robust results in both prediction accuracy and interpretability. However, existing research has not clearly established the relationship between network characteristics and link creation mechanisms. The ability to predict complex networks with diverse features still requires further investigation. In light of this, we introduce a novel framework designed to combine the best features of different link prediction algorithms when applied to the network, with the aim of achieving more reliable predictions about how networks will evolve in consequence. According to the proposed framework, this first focuses on the feature extraction stage. During this phase, we systematically identify and extract a comprehensive set of features from the network before moving on to the classification phase. Here, we utilize state-of-the-art ensemble learning models to assess and classify potential links within the network. By training our Machine Learning (ML) models on the extracted features, we can effectively predict whether a particular link is likely to form (positive link) or unlikely to form (negative link). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: Twitch and Facebook. Additionally, we assessed their performance on these datasets by conducting specific preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning steps. This research makes a significant contribution to improving link prediction in dynamic social networks.",2024,,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004cd6d5cc917a5149bf985daf80695c9ef52ffc

During this phase, we systematically identify and extract a comprehensive set of features from the network before moving on to the classification phase. Here, we utilize state-of-the-art ensemble learning models to assess and classify potential links within the network. By training our Machine Learning (ML) models on the extracted features, we can effectively predict whether a particular link is likely to form (positive link) or unlikely to form (negative link). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: Twitch and Facebook. Additionally, we assessed their performance on these datasets by conducting specific preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning steps. This research makes a significant contribution to improving link prediction in dynamic social networks.",2023,,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004cd6d5cc917a5149bf985daf80695c9ef52ffc

Such models quantitatively define how a biological system works based on causal relationships and use that cumulative biological knowledge to generate predictions and recommendations (in practice) and generate/evaluate hypotheses (in research). Their limitations revolve around obtaining sufficiently accurate inputs, user training and accuracy/precision of predictions on-farm. The new wave in digitalization technologies may negate some of these challenges. New data-driven (DD) modelling methods such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) examine patterns in data to produce accurate predictions (forecasting, classification of animals, etc.). The deluge of sensor data and new self-learning modelling techniques may address some of the limitations of traditional MM approaches - access to input data (e.g. sensors) and on-farm calibration. However, most of these new methods lack transparency in the reasoning behind predictions, in contrast to MM that have historically been used to translate knowledge into wisdom. The objective of this paper is to propose means to hybridize these two seemingly divergent methodologies to advance the models we use in animal production systems and support movement towards truly knowledge-based precision agriculture. In order to identify potential niches for models in animal production of the future, a cross-species (dairy, swine and poultry) examination of the current state of the art in MM and new DD methodologies (ML, DL analytics) is undertaken. We hypothesize that there are several ways via which synergy may be achieved to advance both our predictive capabilities and system understanding, being: (1) building and utilizing data streams (e.g. intake, rumination behaviour, rumen sensors, activity sensors, environmental sensors, cameras and near IR) to apply MM in real-time and/or with new resolution and capabilities; (2) hybridization of MM and DD approaches where, for example, a ML framework is augmented by MM-generated parameters or predicted outcomes and (3) hybridization of the MM and DD approaches, where biological bounds are placed on parameters within a MM framework, and the DD system parameterizes the MM for individual animals, farms or other such clusters of data.

This paper examines the trends in household charging sessions’ timing, duration, and energy consumption by analyzing real-world residential charging data. By leveraging the information collected from each session, a novel framework is introduced for the efficient, real-time prediction of important charging characteristics. Utilizing historical data and user-specific features, machine learning models are trained to predict the connection duration, charging duration, charging demand, and time until the next session. These models enhance the understanding of EV users’ behavior and provide practical tools for optimizing the EV charging infrastructure and effectively managing the charging demand.

10.2196/41566,Personalized Prediction of Response to Smartphone-Delivered Meditation Training: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background Meditation apps have surged in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals turning to these apps to cope with stress, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” (PAI) reflecting an individual’s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

10.1002/anbr.202300085,Machine Learning‐Based Prediction of Immunomodulatory Properties of Polymers: Toward a Faster and Easier Development of Anti‐Inflammatory Biomaterials,"In biomaterials development, creating materials with desirable properties can be a time‐consuming and resource‐intensive process, often relying on serendipitous discoveries. A potential route to accelerate this process is to employ artificial intelligence methodologies such as machine learning (ML). Herein, the possibility to predict anti‐inflammatory properties of the polymers by using a simplified model of inflammation and a restrained dataset is explored. Cellular assays with 50 different polymers are conducted using the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. These experiments generate a dataset which is used to develop a ML model based on Bayesian logistic regression. After conducting a Bayesian logistic regression analysis, two ML models, K‐nearest neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes, are employed to predict anti‐inflammatory polymers properties. The study finds that the probability of a polymer having anti‐inflammatory properties is multiplied by three if it is a polycation, and that nitric oxide secretion is a good indicator in determining the anti‐inflammatory properties of a polymer, which in this work are defined by tumor necrosis factor alpha expression decrease. Overall, the study suggests that with appropriate dataset design, ML techniques can provide valuable information on functional polymer properties, enabling faster and more efficient biomaterial development.",2024,2024-01-08,2.0,18.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00017dccee63f60b8af0acb7d08831b29bc4e3a6

10.3389/fonc.2025.1531465,The aggrephagy-related gene TUBA1B influences clinical outcomes in glioma patients by regulating the cell cycle,"Background Gliomas are common primary malignant brain tumors, with glioblastoma (GBM) being the most aggressive subtype. GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high TUBA1B expression is closely associated with glioma malignancy and poor prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target.",2025,2025-02-28,0.0,42.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d0ebfeb82a9c0fe964bd5ca0811f352883cf

Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 203 patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI before prostate biopsy were included. After manual segmentation, radiomic features (RFs) were extracted from T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, and high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI). Patients were split into training sets and testing sets according to a ratio of 8:2. A pipeline considering combinations of two feature selection (FS) methods and six ML classifiers was developed and evaluated. The performance of models was assessed using the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1-measure, and the area under curve (AUC). Results: On high b-value DWMRI-derived features, a combination of FS method recursive feature elimination (RFE) and classifier random forest achieved the highest performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs, with 97.0% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity, 98.0% precision, and 97.0% F1-measure. The method also achieved an average AUC for GG of 98%. Conclusion: Preoperative mpMRI radiomic analysis based on ML, as a noninvasive approach, showed good performance for classification of prostate cancer into five GGs. Advances in Knowledge: Herein, radiomic models based on preoperative mpMRI and ML were developed to classify prostate cancer into 5 GGs. Our study provides evidence that analysis of quantitative RFs extracted from high b-value DWMRI images based on a combination of FS method RFE and classifier random forest can be applied for multiclass grading of prostate cancer with an accuracy of 97.0%.",2024,2024-12-01,0.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00026937c840c52bf8b75ff78140f386c0f172dc

This study aims to ascertain differences in the importance features of machine learning models of household disaster preparedness for four groups to inform culturally tailored intervention recommendations for nursing practice. A machine learning model was developed and tested by combining data from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Federal Emergency Management Agency National Household Survey. The primary outcome variable was a composite readiness score. A total of 252 variables from 15,048 participants were included. Over 10% of the sample self-identified as African American/Black and 30.3% reported being 65 years of age or older. Importance features varied regarding financial and insurance preparedness, information seeking and transportation between groups.

10.1101/2024.09.19.613896,CanDrivR-CS: A Cancer-Specific Machine Learning Framework for Distinguishing Recurrent and Rare Variants,"Motivation Missense variants play a crucial role in cancer development, and distinguishing between those that frequently occur in cancer genomes and those that are rare may provide valuable insights into important functional mechanisms and consequences. Specifically, if common variants confer growth advantages, they may have undergone positive selection across different patients due to similar selection pressures. Moreover, studies have demonstrated the significance of rare mutations that arise as resistance mechanisms in response to drug treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of both recurrent and rare variants in cancer. In addition to this, most existing tools for variant prediction focus on distinguishing variants found in normal and disease populations, often without considering the specific disease contexts in which these variants arise. Instead, they typically build predictors that generalise across all diseases. Here, we introduce CanDrivR-CS, a set of cancer-specific gradient boosting models designed to distinguish between rare and recurrent cancer variants. Results We curated missense variant data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Cancer-type-specific models significantly outperformed a baseline pan-cancer model, achieving a maximum leave-one-group-out cross-validation (LOGO-CV) F1 score of up to 90% for CanDrivRSKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma) and 89% for CanDrivR-SKCA (Skin Adenocarcinoma), compared to 79.2% for the baseline model. Notably, DNA shape properties consistently ranked among the top features for distinguishing recurrent and rare variants across all cancers. Specifically, recurrent missense variants frequently occurred in DNA bends and rolls, potentially implicating regions prone to DNA replication errors and acting as mutational hotspots.

10.3390/w14081300,An Improved Transfer Learning Model for Cyanobacterial Bloom Concentration Prediction,"The outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms is a serious water environmental problem, and the harm it brings to aquatic ecosystems and water supply systems cannot be underestimated. It is very important to establish an accurate prediction model of cyanobacterial bloom concentration, which is a challenging issue. Machine learning techniques can improve the prediction accuracy, but a large amount of historical monitoring data is needed to train these models. For some waters with an inconvenient geographical location or frequent sensor failures, there are not enough historical data to train the model. To deal with this problem, a fused model based on a transfer learning method is proposed in this paper. In this study, the data of water environment with a large amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the source domain in order to learn the knowledge of cyanobacterial bloom growth characteristics and train the prediction model. The data of the water environment with a small amount of historical monitoring data are taken as the target domain in order to load the model trained in the source domain. Then, the training set of the target domain is used to participate in the inter-layer fine-tuning training of the model to obtain the transfer learning model. At last, the transfer learning model is fused with a convolutional neural network to obtain the prediction model. Various experiments are conducted for a 2 h prediction on the test set of the target domain. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of cyanobacterial blooms for the water environment with a low data volume.",2022,2022-04-16,9.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0003e0ac0f8f4b50065f0e0c43b95896639fe2a3

However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.",2021,2021-09-01,31.0,81.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00040bdd447f041a50ae95fd51926cf435ef1eba

10.3390/s23031639,At the Confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Edge Computing in IoT-Based Applications: A Review and New Perspectives,"Given its advantages in low latency, fast response, context-aware services, mobility, and privacy preservation, edge computing has emerged as the key support for intelligent applications and 5G/6G Internet of things (IoT) networks. This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents. These are the same factors that most studies have used to evaluate the success of an edge-based application. In this review, we first provide an in-depth analysis of the state of the art of AI in edge-based applications with a focus on eight application areas: smart agriculture, smart environment, smart grid, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart education, smart transportation, and security and privacy. Then, we present a qualitative comparison that emphasizes the main objective of the confluence, the roles and the use of artificial intelligence at the network edge, and the key enabling technologies for edge analytics.

Previous studies have targeted particular patient populations with life-limiting disease, but few have focused on patients in a primary care setting. Toward this end, we propose a stepped-wedge pragmatic randomized trial whereby a machine learning algorithm identifies patients empaneled to primary care units at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, United States) with high likelihood of palliative care need. Methods 42 care team units in 9 clusters were randomized to 7 wedges, each lasting 42 days. For care teams in treatment wedges, palliative care specialists review identified patients, making recommendations to primary care providers when appropriate. Care teams in control wedges receive palliative care under the standard of care. Discussion This pragmatic trial therefore integrates machine learning into clinical decision making, instead of simply reporting theoretical predictive performance. Such integration has the possibility to decrease time to palliative care, improving patient quality of life and symptom burden.

10.3389/fcell.2022.937761,Spontaneous Activity Predicts Survival of Developing Cortical Neurons,"Spontaneous activity plays a crucial role in brain development by coordinating the integration of immature neurons into emerging cortical networks. High levels and complex patterns of spontaneous activity are generally associated with low rates of apoptosis in the cortex. However, whether spontaneous activity patterns directly encode for survival of individual cortical neurons during development remains an open question. Here, we longitudinally investigated spontaneous activity and apoptosis in developing cortical cultures, combining extracellular electrophysiology with calcium imaging. These experiments demonstrated that the early occurrence of calcium transients was strongly linked to neuronal survival. Silent neurons exhibited a higher probability of cell death, whereas high frequency spiking and burst behavior were almost exclusively detected in surviving neurons. In local neuronal clusters, activity of neighboring neurons exerted a pro-survival effect, whereas on the functional level, networks with a high modular topology were associated with lower cell death rates. Using machine learning algorithms, cell fate of individual neurons was predictable through the integration of spontaneous activity features. Our results indicate that high frequency spiking activity constrains apoptosis in single neurons through sustained calcium rises and thereby consolidates networks in which a high modular topology is reached during early development.",2022,2022-08-10,12.0,105.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005578d0e79d27dba8001b7f16c759b80ae4414

10.48175/ijarsct-14367,Challenges Faced During Implementation of Digital Twin in Construction Project Monitoring,"Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining popularity because they provide precise digital copies of assets, processes, and systems. This is especially true when these DTs are paired with real-time simulation models that make use of modern technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. These combinations can provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of the monitored systems. Digital twin (DT) has shown tremendous potential to bring about revolutionary improvements in the field of construction site surveillance. There is, however, a notable paucity of empirical research identifying the constant elements affecting DT adoption in this industry. This research tries to fill that void by identifying the important elements that determine the usage of DT in construction. The study adopts a complete framework with the goal of increasing the use of DT in building site monitoring. The elements influencing the adoption and effectiveness of distributed ledger technology (DT) are divided into three categories: technological, organizational, and economic. Technological factors include the system's appropriateness and the robustness of the data infrastructure. Organizational considerations include the company's openness to innovation and leadership support. Economic aspects include things like return on investment (ROI) and cost-effectiveness. The research technique combines case studies and literature reviews to examine the benefits and drawbacks of DT in construction monitoring. This study's expected output is a comprehensive framework that aids construction businesses in optimizing the use of DT in site monitoring. This would allow for more efficient, data-driven, and forward-thinking processes. The study's ultimate purpose is to provide critical knowledge that will assist the building sector in adopting cutting-edge methods. The industry may better plan for the integration of this sophisticated technology into their operations by knowing the potential of DT and the variables driving its adoption.

10.3390/agriculture14111900,UAV-Based Multispectral Winter Wheat Growth Monitoring with Adaptive Weight Allocation,"Comprehensive growth index (CGI) more accurately reflects crop growth conditions than single indicators, which is crucial for precision irrigation, fertilization, and yield prediction. However, many current studies overlook the relationships between different growth parameters and their varying contributions to yield, leading to overlapping information and lower accuracy in monitoring crop growth. Therefore, this study focuses on winter wheat and constructs a comprehensive growth monitoring index (CGIac), based on adaptive weight allocation of growth parameters’ contribution to yield, using data such as leaf area index (LAI), soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, plant height (PH), biomass (BM), and plant water content (PWC). Using UAV data on vegetation indices, feature selection was performed using the Elastic Net. The growth inversion model was then constructed using machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector regression (SVR). Based on the optimal growth inversion model for winter wheat, spatial distribution of wheat growth in the study area is obtained. The findings demonstrated that CGIac outperforms CGIav (constructed using equal weighting) and CGIcv (built using the coefficient of variation) in yield correlation and prediction accuracy. Specifically, the yield correlation of CGIac improved by up to 0.76 compared to individual indices, while yield prediction accuracy increased by up to 23.14%. Among the evaluated models, the RF model achieved the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.895 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0058. A comparison with wheat orthophotos from the same period confirmed that the inversion results were highly consistent with actual growth conditions in the study area. The proposed method significantly improved the accuracy and applicability of winter wheat growth monitoring, overcoming the limitations of single parameters in growth prediction. Additionally, it provided new technological support and innovative solutions for regional crop monitoring and precision farming operations.",2024,2024-10-26,0.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0005a412ddf59452f7c58c49b6060a62d0bba0f1

10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00313,"Learning To Predict Reaction Conditions: Relationships between Solvent, Molecular Structure, and Catalyst","Reaction databases provide a great deal of useful information to assist planning of experiments, but do not provide any interpretation or chemical concepts to accompany this information. In this work reactions are labeled with experimental conditions and network analysis shows that consistencies within clusters of data points can be leveraged to organize this information. In particular, this analysis shows how particular experimental conditions (specifically solvent) are effective in enabling specific organic reactions (Friedel-Crafts, Aldol addition, Claisen condensation, Diels-Alder, and Wittig), including variations within each reaction class. An example of network analysis is shown in the graphical abstract, where data points for a Claisen condensation reaction break into clusters that depend on the catalyst and chemical structure. This type of clustering, which mimics how a chemist reasons, is derived directly from the network. Therefore the findings of this work could augment synthesis planning by providing predictions in a fashion that mimics human chemists. To numerically evaluate solvent prediction ability, three methods are compared: network analysis (through the k-nearest neighbor algorithm), a support vector machine, and a deep neural network. The most accurate method in 4 of the 5 test cases is the network analysis, with deep neural networks also showing good prediction scores.

They are likely to provide many lead structures, which can be used as templates for the construction of novel drugs with enhanced antitumor activity. Traditional research approaches studied structure-activity relationship of natural products and obtained key structural properties, such as chemical bond or group, with the purpose of ascertaining their effect on a single cell line or a single tissue type. Here, for the first time, we develop a machine learning method to comprehensively predict natural products responses against a panel of cancer cell lines based on both the gene expression and the chemical properties of natural products. The results on two datasets, training set and independent test set, show that this proposed method yields significantly better prediction accuracy. In addition, we also demonstrate the predictive power of our proposed method by modeling the cancer cell sensitivity to two natural products, Curcumin and Resveratrol, which indicate that our method can effectively predict the response of cancer cell lines to these two natural products. Taken together, the method will facilitate the identification of natural products as cancer therapies and the development of precision medicine by linking the features of patient genomes to natural product sensitivity.",2015,2015-11-26,14.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00088b98a908818352fe051fe98f42f25a460b85

10.1049/rpg2.12985,Exploring the application of machine‐learning techniques in the next generation of long‐term hydropower‐thermal scheduling,"This paper introduces a shape‐based inflow scenarios reduction framework applied in long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling. This scheduling problem involves strategically managing the limited stored hydro energy in coordination with the electricity system. The scenario fan problem, selected as a long‐term hydro‐thermal scheduling approach, can effectively represent the individual hydropower plants and their short‐term flexibility within the long‐term scheduling process, making it well‐suited for capturing the disaggregated physical characteristics of hydro stations. However, the computational burden of scenario fan problem increases due to the complexity of the cascaded system and the large number of inflow scenarios. To tackle these challenges, a machine learning clustering method is developed for extracting shape‐based features to capture the energy and shape attributes of hydro inflows. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing it with four established clustering methods. This evaluation was carried out on a hydro‐thermal test case, utilizing both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample data analysis.

In this paper, an energy-efficient control and routing protocol for wireless sensor networks is presented. This algorithm is based on reinforcement learning for energy management in the network. This protocol seeks to optimize routing policies to maximize the long-term reward received by each node, using reinforcement learning, which is a machine learning approach. In order to improve the lifetime of wireless sensor network, three energy management approaches have been proposed. The first approach is to navigate correctly using reinforcement learning to reduce the length of the routes and to improve energy consumption. The second approach is to exploit a sleep scheduling technique to improve node energy consumption. The last approach is used to restrict data transmission of each node based on the received data change rate. Simulation results show that in terms of network lifespan, the proposed method significantly outperforms previous reported methods.",2022,,19.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a1779aaf160a615b268d833c30cca91f55f98
10.3389/fimmu.2024.1461424,"Unraveling the role of ADAMs in clinical heterogeneity and the immune microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma: insights from single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA sequencing","Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and heterogeneous tumor with limited treatment options and unfavorable prognosis. The crucial role of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) gene family in the tumor microenvironment of HCC remains unclear. Methods This study employed a novel multi-omics integration strategy to investigate the potential roles of ADAM family signals in HCC. A series of single-cell and spatial omics algorithms were utilized to uncover the molecular characteristics of ADAM family genes within HCC. The GSVA package was utilized to compute the scores for ADAM family signals, subsequently stratified into three categories: high, medium, and low ADAM signal levels through unsupervised clustering. Furthermore, we developed and rigorously validated an innovative and robust clinical prognosis assessment model by employing 99 mainstream machine learning algorithms in conjunction with co-expression feature spectra of ADAM family genes. To validate our findings, we conducted PCR and IHC experiments to confirm differential expression patterns within the ADAM family genes. Results Gene signals from the ADAM family were notably abundant in endothelial cells, liver cells, and monocyte macrophages. Single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analyses have both revealed the molecular heterogeneity of the ADAM gene family, further emphasizing its significant impact on the development and progression of HCC. In HCC tissues, the expression levels of ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 were markedly elevated. Elevated ADAM family signal scores were linked to adverse clinical outcomes and disruptions in the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming. An ADAM prognosis signal, developed through the utilization of 99 machine learning algorithms, could accurately forecast the survival duration of HCC, achieving an AUC value of approximately 0.9. Conclusions This study represented the inaugural report on the deleterious impact and prognostic significance of ADAM family signals within the tumor microenvironment of HCC.",2024,2024-09-13,5.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a5d98243250c138efd38742555d600655a9e5
10.1038/s41598-018-34671-6,Application of Wearable Inertial Sensors and A New Test Battery for Distinguishing Retrospective Fallers from Non-fallers among Community-dwelling Older People,"Considering the challenge of population ageing and the substantial health problem among the elderly population from falls, the purpose of this study was to verify whether it is possible to distinguish accurately between older fallers and non-fallers, based on data from wearable inertial sensors collected during a specially designed test battery. A comprehensive but practical test battery using 5 wearable inertial sensors for multifactorial fall risk assessment was designed. This was followed by an experimental study on 196 community-dwelling Korean older women, categorized as fallers (N1 = 82) and non-fallers (N2 = 114) based on prior history of falls. Six machine learning models (logistic regression, naïve bayes, decision tree, random forest, boosted tree and support vector machine) were proposed for faller classification. Results indicated that compared with non-fallers, fallers performed significantly worse on the test battery. In addition, the application of sensor data and support vector machine for faller classification achieved an overall accuracy of 89.4% with 92.7% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity. These findings suggest that wearable inertial sensor based systems show promise for elderly fall risk assessment, which could be implemented in clinical practice to identify “at-risk” individuals reliably to promote proactive fall prevention.",2018,2018-11-05,63.0,66.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a70d56c431e0c2bb8b789f71f5ba1363b65c9
10.3390/ijerph16142598,Hip and Wrist-Worn Accelerometer Data Analysis for Toddler Activities,"Although accelerometry data are widely utilized to estimate physical activity and sedentary behavior among children age 3 years or older, for toddlers age 1 and 2 year(s), accelerometry data recorded during such behaviors have been far less examined. In particular, toddler’s unique behaviors, such as riding in a stroller or being carried by an adult, have not yet been examined. The objective of this study was to describe accelerometry signal outputs recorded during participation in nine types of behaviors (i.e., running, walking, climbing up/down, crawling, riding a ride-on toy, standing, sitting, riding in a stroller/wagon, and being carried by an adult) among toddlers. Twenty-four toddlers aged 13 to 35 months (50% girls) performed various prescribed behaviors during free play in a commercial indoor playroom while wearing ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on a hip and a wrist. Participants’ performances were video-recorded. Based on the video data, accelerometer data were annotated with behavior labels to examine accelerometry signal outputs while performing the nine types of behaviors. Accelerometer data collected during 664 behavior assessments from the 21 participants were used for analysis. Hip vertical axis counts for walking were low (median = 49 counts/5 s). They were significantly lower than those recorded while a toddler was “carried” by an adult (median = 144 counts/5 s; p < 0.01). While standing, sitting, and riding in a stroller, very low hip vertical axis counts were registered (median ≤ 5 counts/5 s). Although wrist vertical axis and vector magnitude counts for “carried” were not higher than those for walking, they were higher than the cut-points for sedentary behaviors. Using various accelerometry signal features, machine learning techniques showed 89% accuracy to differentiate the “carried” behavior from ambulatory movements such as running, walking, crawling, and climbing. In conclusion, hip vertical axis counts alone may be unable to capture walking as physical activity and “carried” as sedentary behavior among toddlers. Machine learning techniques that utilize additional accelerometry signal features could help to recognize behavior types, especially to differentiate being “carried” from ambulatory movements.",2019,2019-07-01,15.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a71f483a2798bc7411f9fcc6af3a66d0a08c7

10.3390/electronics12122715,Embedding-Based Deep Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network Graph Classifiers,"One of the most significant graph data analysis tasks is graph classification, as graphs are complex data structures used for illustrating relationships between entity pairs. Graphs are essential in many domains, such as the description of chemical molecules, biological networks, social relationships, etc. Real-world graphs are complicated and large. As a result, there is a need to find a way to represent or encode a graph’s structure so that it can be easily utilized by machine learning models. Therefore, graph embedding is considered one of the most powerful solutions for graph representation. Inspired by the Doc2Vec model in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this paper first investigates different ways of (sub)graph embedding to represent each graph or subgraph as a fixed-length feature vector, which is then used as input to any classifier. Thus, two supervised classifiers—a deep neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)—are proposed to enhance graph classification. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed models obtain competitive results and are superior to some traditional classification methods and deep-learning-based approaches on three out of five benchmark datasets, with an impressive accuracy rate of 94% on the NCI1 dataset.",2023,2023-06-17,3.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a9f529fdcac451cd35d7303bcc64ea2a9fcbc

Only two of the isomers have been detected in emissions from the interstellar medium (ISM); possible further candidates are identified, and the likelihood of their being detectable is considered. In general, hardly any of these compounds have been discussed in the existing chemical literature, so this work represents an important contribution extending the canon of chemical bonding which can contribute to machine learning, providing a more exacting test of AI applications. The presence in the ISM of acetamide, CH3C(O)NH2, is the subject of current debate with no clear and obvious paths to its formation; it is shown that a 1,3-[H]-transfer from (E,Z)-ethanimidic acid, CH3C(OH)=NH, is feasible in spite of an energy barrier of 130 kJ mol–1.

A systemic review and a meta-analysis. We also provided a retrospective cohort for validation in this study.


OBJECTIVE
(1) Using a meta-analysis to determine the pooled discriminatory ability of The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) classical algorithm (CA) and machine learning algorithms (MLA); and (2) test the hypothesis that SORG-CA has less variability in performance than SORG-MLA in non-American validation cohorts as SORG-CA does not incorporates regional-specific variables such as body mass index as input.


METHODS
After data extraction from the included studies, logit-transformation was applied for extracted AUCs for further analysis. The discriminatory abilities of both algorithms were directly compared by their logit (AUC)s. Further subgroup analysis by region (America vs non-America) was also conducted by comparing the corresponding logit (AUC).


RESULTS
The pooled logit (AUC)s of 90-day SORG-CA was .82 (95% confidence interval [CI], .53-.11), 1-year SORG-CA was 1.11 (95% CI, .74-1.48), 90-day SORG-MLA was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.63), and 1-year SORG-MLA was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.17-1.98). All the algorithms performed better in United States than in Taiwan (P < .001). The performance of SORG-CA was less influenced by a non-American cohort than SORG-MLA.

Materials and methods A total of 1278 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 were included. The participants were divided into training and testing groups using fivefold cross-validation method. Four models, two traditional statistical models (logistic regression and ISAN) and two machine learning models (random forest and support vector machine), were established and evaluated. The outcomes and baseline characteristics were compared between the SAP and non-SAP groups. Results Among the of 1278 patients, 281(22.0%) developed SAP after their first ICH. Multivariate analysis revealed that the logistic regression (LR) model was superior in predicting SAP in both the training and testing groups. Independent predictors of SAP after ICH included total CSVD burden score (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.54), haematoma extension into ventricle (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.87–3.31), haematoma with multilobar involvement (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.44–3.18), transpharyngeal intubation operation (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.7–5.62), admission NIHSS score ≥ 10 (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.42–3.01), male sex (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16–2.52), and age ≥ 67 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.56–3.22). The patients in the SAP group had worse outcomes than those in the non-SAP group. Conclusion This study established a clinically combined imaging model for predicting stroke-associated pneumonia and demonstrated superior performance compared with the existing ISAN model. Given the poor outcomes observed in patients with SAP, the use of individualised predictive nomograms is vital in clinical practice.",2024,2024-07-24,1.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000e245ed752d1169163ed02ffc2fdadd18e2540
10.1155/ASP.2005.3128,Feature Selection and Blind Source Separation in an EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interface,"Most EEG-based BCI systems make use of well-studied patterns of brain activity. However, those systems involve tasks that indirectly map to simple binary commands such as ""yes"" or ""no"" or require many weeks of biofeedback training. We hypothesized that signal processing and machine learning methods can be used to discriminate EEG in a direct ""yes""/""no"" BCI from a single session. Blind source separation (BSS) and spectral transformations of the EEG produced a 180-dimensional feature space. We used a modified genetic algorithm (GA) wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to search the space of feature subsets. The GA-based search found feature subsets that outperform full feature sets and random feature subsets. Also, BSS transformations of the EEG outperformed the original time series, particularly in conjunction with a subset search of both spaces. The results suggest that BSS and feature selection can be used to improve the performance of even a ""direct,"" single-session BCI.",2005,,80.0,62.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000e5f9f05e51e068014ad8e6940de0ae9df77fb

10.1177/2053951719849444,The combine will tell the truth: On precision agriculture and algorithmic rationality,"Recent technological and methodological changes in farming have led to an emerging set of claims about the role of digital technology in food production. Known as precision agriculture, the integration of digital management and surveillance technologies in farming is normatively presented as a revolutionary transformation. Proponents contend that machine learning, Big Data, and automation will create more accurate, efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly food production, staving off both food insecurity and ecological ruin. This article contributes a critique of these rhetorical and discursive claims to a growing body of critical literature on precision agriculture. It argues precision agriculture is less a revolution than an evolution, an effort to shore up and intensify the conventional farming system responsible for generating many of the social and environmental problems precision agriculture is presented as solving. While precision agriculture advocates portray it as a radical, even democratic epistemological break with the past, this paper locates truth claims surrounding datafication and algorithmic control in farming within deeper historical contexts of the capitalist rationalization of production and efforts to quantify and automate physical and mental labor. Abjuring the growing cultural tendency to treat algorithmic systems as revolutionary in favor of social and historical dimensions of precision agriculture, can help re-frame the discussion about its design and use around real, socially and ecologically oriented change in farming, and so ensure that the possibilities and benefits of precision agriculture are as evenly and effectively shared as possible.",2019,2019-01-01,115.0,81.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f4079fb3f5463ce7f5e566b541fec68a91f02

10.1186/1471-2105-7-319,Protein disorder prediction by condensed PSSM considering propensity for order or disorder,"BackgroundMore and more disordered regions have been discovered in protein sequences, and many of them are found to be functionally significant. Previous studies reveal that disordered regions of a protein can be predicted by its primary structure, the amino acid sequence. One observation that has been widely accepted is that ordered regions usually have compositional bias toward hydrophobic amino acids, and disordered regions are toward charged amino acids. Recent studies further show that employing evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) improves the prediction accuracy of protein disorder. As more and more machine learning techniques have been introduced to protein disorder detection, extracting more useful features with biological insights attracts more attention.ResultsThis paper first studies the effect of a condensed position specific scoring matrix with respect to physicochemical properties (PSSMP) on the prediction accuracy, where the PSSMP is derived by merging several amino acid columns of a PSSM belonging to a certain property into a single column. Next, we decompose each conventional physicochemical property of amino acids into two disjoint groups which have a propensity for order and disorder respectively, and show by experiments that some of the new properties perform better than their parent properties in predicting protein disorder. In order to get an effective and compact feature set on this problem, we propose a hybrid feature selection method that inherits the efficiency of uni-variant analysis and the effectiveness of the stepwise feature selection that explores combinations of multiple features. The experimental results show that the selected feature set improves the performance of a classifier built with Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) in comparison with the feature set constructed with PSSMs or PSSMPs that adopt simply the conventional physicochemical properties.ConclusionDistinguishing disordered regions from ordered regions in protein sequences facilitates the exploration of protein structures and functions. Results based on independent testing data reveal that the proposed predicting model DisPSSMP performs the best among several of the existing packages doing similar tasks, without either under-predicting or over-predicting the disordered regions. Furthermore, the selected properties are demonstrated to be useful in finding discriminating patterns for order/disorder classification.",2006,2006-06-23,99.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f70100783b16315ff748f23387076fc91d876

10.33395/sinkron.v8i3.12721,Comparison of Residual Network-50 and Convolutional Neural Network Conventional Architecture For Fruit Image Classification,"Classification of fruit images using machine learning technology has had a significant impact on human life by enabling accurate recognition of various fruits. With the advancements in technology, machine learning architectures have become increasingly diverse and sophisticated, providing enhanced capabilities for fruit image classification. However, previous studies have primarily focused on classifying fruits at a basic level. Therefore, there is a growing need for the development and application of Fruit Image Classification systems within the community, particularly in the field of agriculture. Such applications can play a pivotal role in leveraging technology to benefit the agricultural sector, empowering users to gain satisfaction and knowledge regarding different fruits through the utilization of these applications. In this study, we employ both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and a Residual Network-50 for fruit image classification. To ensure robust performance evaluation, the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, with fruits categorized into specific classes. Furthermore, identical preprocessing and optimization techniques are applied to both architectures to maintain consistency and fairness during the evaluation process. The results of our classification experiments on a dataset consisting of 17 different fruit classes reveal that the conventional CNN architecture achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.998 (99%) with a minimal loss of 0.009. On the other hand, the Residual Network-50 demonstrates a slightly lower accuracy of 0.994 (99%) but with a slightly higher loss of 0.02. Despite the higher loss, the Residual Network-50's accuracy remains comparable to that of the conventional architecture, showcasing its potential for fruit image classification. By leveraging the power of machine learning and these advanced architectures, fruit image classification systems can provide valuable insights and assistance to users.

The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

Datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We integrated the datasets, removed the batch effects and analyzed immune cell infiltration along with differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the positively correlated gene modules.

The WGCNA analysis demonstrates that the blue module was highly correlated and statistically significant as well as enriched in immune-related signaling pathways and biological functions in the KEGG and GO enrichment. LASSO-cox regression analysis screened 11 characteristic genes from the hub genes of the blue module. After the DEG, characteristic gene and immune-related gene datasets were intersected, three genes, PTGS1, HLA-DMB and GPR137B, were identified as the risk genes in this research.

As a result, for hydropower generation to be sustainable, future water availability in hydropower plants must be known. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely estimate how the river flow will alter as a result of changing rainfall patterns. Finding the best value for the hyper-parameters is one of the problems with machine learning algorithms, which have lately been adopted by many academics. In this research, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is integrated with a nature-inspired optimizer, namely Cuckoo search algorithm (CS-ANN). The performance of the proposed algorithm then will be examined based on statistical indices namely Root-Mean-Square Error (RSME) and Determination Coefficient ( R 2 ). Then, the accuracy of the proposed model will be then examined with the stand-alone Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The statistical indices results indicate that the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model showed an improvement based on R 2 value as compared to ANN model with R 2 of 0.900 at training stage and R 2 of 0.935 at testing stage. RMSE value, for ANN model, is 127.79 m 3 /s for training stage and 12.7 m 3 /s at testing stage. While for the proposed Hybrid CS-ANN model, RMSE value is equal to 121.7 m 3 /s for training stage and 10.95 m 3 /s for testing stage.

Machine learning algorithms could provide an objective theoretical basis for tunnel parameter decision making. However, due to the limitations of a machine learning model’s performance and parameter selection methods, the prediction model had poor prediction results and low reliability for parameter research. To solve the above problems, based on a large number of construction parameters of a composite section subway in Shenzhen, this paper combined dimensionality reduction data with service analysis to optimize the selection process of shield tunneling parameters, and determined the total propulsion force, cutter head torque, cutter head speed, and advance rate as key tunneling parameters. Based on an LGBM algorithm and Bayesian optimization, the prediction model of key tunneling parameters of an earth pressure balance shield was established. The results showed that the average error of the LGBM model on the test set was 8.18%, the average error of the cutter head torque was 13.93%, the average error of the cutter head speed was 3.16%, and the average error of advance rate was 13.35%.

Nowadays, going 24 hours without getting in touch with them in some way has become difficult. Facebook and Twitter, these social platforms are now part of everyday life. Thus, these social networks have become important sources to be aware of frequently discussed topics or public opinions on a current issue. A lot of people write messages about current events, give their opinion on any topic and discuss social issues more and more. The emergence and enormous popularity of these social networks have led to the emergence of several types of analysis to take advantage of them. One of them is the analysis of opinions in texts. It aims at automatically classifying opinions in order to position them on a sentiment scale, thus allowing to characterize a set of opinions without having to rely on a human to read them. Currently, opinion analysis offers us a lot of information related to public opinion, either in the commercial world or in the political world. Many studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB), perform well in this type of classification.

10.3390/app112210795,Fine-Grained Named Entity Recognition Using a Multi-Stacked Feature Fusion and Dual-Stacked Output in Korean,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task to identify spans that mention named entities and to annotate them with predefined named entity classes. Although many NER models based on machine learning have been proposed, their performance in terms of processing fine-grained NER tasks was less than acceptable. This is because the training data of a fine-grained NER task is much more unbalanced than those of a coarse-grained NER task. To overcome the problem presented by unbalanced data, we propose a fine-grained NER model that compensates for the sparseness of fine-grained NEs by using the contextual information of coarse-grained NEs. From another viewpoint, many NER models have used different levels of features, such as part-of-speech tags and gazetteer look-up results, in a nonhierarchical manner. Unfortunately, these models experience the feature interference problem. Our solution to this problem is to adopt a multi-stacked feature fusion scheme, which accepts different levels of features as its input. The proposed model is based on multi-stacked long short-term memories (LSTMs) with a multi-stacked feature fusion layer for acquiring multilevel embeddings and a dual-stacked output layer for predicting fine-grained NEs based on the categorical information of coarse-grained NEs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed model is capable of state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the proposed model can effectively alleviate the unbalanced data problem that frequently occurs in a fine-grained NER task. In addition, the multi-stacked feature fusion layer contributes to the improvement of NER performance, confirming that the proposed model can alleviate the feature interference problem. Based on this experimental result, we conclude that the proposed model is well-designed to effectively perform NER tasks.",2021,2021-11-15,5.0,8.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0014ecb6e7055de7b3bef3d5619446c24fdf0db4

Conveniently, these compact devices are also equipped with high-precision transducers such as accelerometers and microphones, integrated mechanically and designed on-board to support a range of user functionalities. However, unintended access to these transducer signals (bypassing normal on-board data access controls) may allow sensitive user interaction information to be detected and thereby exploited. In this study, we show that acoustic features extracted from the on-board microphone signals, supported with accelerometer and gyroscope signals, may be used together with machine learning techniques to successfully determine the user’s touch input location on a touchscreen: our ensemble model, namely the random forest model, predicts touch input location with up to 86% accuracy in a realistic scenario. Accordingly, we present the approach and techniques used, the performance of the model developed, and also discuss limitations and possible mitigation methods to thwart possible exploitation of such unintended signal channels.",2021,2021-05-25,3.0,30.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001555747a6afdf31245679a6588240887954691

In addition, we introduce tuneout, a novel regularization technique inspired by dropout. We apply these techniques, alone and in combination, to neural machine translation, obtaining improvements on IWSLT datasets for English→German and English→Russian.

10.1002/mrm.29906,Current status in spatiotemporal analysis of contrast‐based perfusion MRI,"In perfusion MRI, image voxels form a spatially organized network of systems, all exchanging indicator with their immediate neighbors. Yet the current paradigm for perfusion MRI analysis treats all voxels or regions‐of‐interest as isolated systems supplied by a single global source. This simplification not only leads to long‐recognized systematic errors but also fails to leverage the embedded spatial structure within the data. Since the early 2000s, a variety of models and implementations have been proposed to analyze systems with between‐voxel interactions. In general, this leads to large and connected numerical inverse problems that are intractible with conventional computational methods. With recent advances in machine learning, however, these approaches are becoming practically feasible, opening up the way for a paradigm shift in the approach to perfusion MRI. This paper seeks to review the work in spatiotemporal modelling of perfusion MRI using a coherent, harmonized nomenclature and notation, with clear physical definitions and assumptions. The aim is to introduce clarity in the state‐of‐the‐art of this promising new approach to perfusion MRI, and help to identify gaps of knowledge and priorities for future research.",2023,2023-11-06,3.0,73.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0015dc7c1a56c53b81f2bab77406c862b0384c5d

A case-control study was conducted and included 177 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 173 control subjects to study the involvement of CD36 gene rs1761667 (G>A) and rs1527483 (C>T) polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of T2DM and dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Lipid profile, blood sugar, gender and age were measured and recorded. Also, genotyping analysis for both polymorphisms was performed. Following statistical analysis, 10 different neural networks and machine learning (ML) tools were used to predict subjects with diabetes or dyslipidemia. Towards further understanding of the role of CD36 protein and gene in T2DM and dyslipidemia, a protein-protein interaction network and meta-analysis were carried out. For both polymorphisms, the genotypic frequencies were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). On the other hand, some ML tools like multilayer perceptron gave high prediction accuracy (≥ 0.75) and Cohen’s kappa (κ) (≥ 0.5). Interestingly, in K-star tool, the accuracy and Cohen’s κ values were enhanced by including the genotyping results as inputs (0.73 and 0.46, respectively, compared to 0.67 and 0.34 without including them). This study confirmed, for the first time, that there is no association between CD36 polymorphisms and T2DM or dyslipidemia among Jordanian population. Prediction of T2DM and dyslipidemia, using these extensive ML tools and based on such input data, is a promising approach for developing diagnostic and prognostic prediction models for a wide spectrum of diseases, especially based on large medical databases.",2021,2021-10-14,9.0,104.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0015ff3512c547223f524e7a74580063cb6fc620

The previously used linear method, unable to cope with the augmented features, is replaced with a boosting classifier assisted by feature selection. The methods indicated show improved performance for 6 language pairs, when applied on the output from MT systems developed over 7 years. The improved models compete better with reference-aware metrics. Notable conclusions are reached through the examination of the contribution of the features in the models, whereas it is possible to identify common MT errors that are captured by the features. Many grammatical/fluency features have a good contribution, few adequacy features have some contribution, whereas source complexity features are of no use.

Reliable and updated road information thus calls for conventional on-site survey being replaced by more accurate and efficient remote sensing technology. Generally, this approach involves image enhancement and extraction of relevant features, such as elongate gradient and intersecting corners. Thus far, its implication is often impeded by wrongly extraction of other urban peripherals with similar pixel characteristics. This paper therefore proposes the fusion of THEOS satellite image and topographic derivatives, obtained from underlying Digital Surface Models (DSM). Multi-spectral indices in thematic layers and surface properties of designated roads were both fed into state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The results were later fused, taken into account consistently leveled road surface. The proposed technique was thus able to eliminate irrelevant urban structures such as buildings and other constructions, otherwise left by conventional index based extraction. The numerical assessment indicates recall of 84.64%, precision of 97.40% and overall accuracy of 97.78%, with 0.89 Kappa statistics.

10.33022/ijcs.v13i2.3847,Deep Learning Algorithms for Detecting and Mitigating DDoS Attacks,"Raising the threat of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks means that high and adapted detection tools are required now more than ever. This research focuses on exploring the latest solutions in preventing DDoS attacks and emphasizes how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is involved in enhancing end-to-end detection techniques. Through the analysis of several key approaches, this work notes that AI-guided models quickly identify and counteract any unusual traffic patterns that may indicate an oncoming DDoS attack. Essential aspects towards creating more resilient networks against such attacks include machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data analytics together with AI based detection systems for traffic pattern recognition. Importantly, AI does well in behavioral analysis because it can distinguish and adapt to changing attack vectors. Additionally, it puts AI into perspective as making positive mitigation strategies possible that contain quick interferences such as temporary halt of traffic, rerouting and targeted block listing with real time control panel operations. On the contrary, current DDoS detection prevention techniques remain critically addressed of persistent challenges and limitations fundamental to them. From what emerges, they should always be ready for innovation and improvement because of how attacks might evolve over time. This paper aligns itself with the position that AI-driven detection mechanisms are natural to network security against DDoS attacks. It underlines the importance of integrating AI-based solutions with conventional practices in order to enhance network resilience and efficiently counteract cyber threats that are evolving all the time.",2024,2024-04-20,0.0,24.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0017097ec9fb7d72967cb7823d7a34ef224cbfc4

In this paper, we present a novel efficient method for thermal and energy management based on bimodal airflow-temperature sensing and reinforcement learning, which expedites an exploration process by self-learning and adjusts action policy only through actuators interacting with the environment, being free of the controlled object model and priori experiences. In general, training of reinforcement learning requires a large amount of data iterations, which takes a long time and is not suitable for real-time control. Here, we propose an approach to speed up the learning process by indicating the action adjustment direction. We adopt tailor-designed bimodal sensors to simultaneously detect airflow and temperature field, which provides comprehensive information for reinforcement learning. The proposed thermal and energy management incorporates bimodal parametric sensing with an improved actor-critic algorithm to realize self-learning control. Experiments of thermal and energy management in a multi-module integrated system validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which demonstrate high efficiency, fast response, and good robustness in various control scenarios.

As a result, this research examines the rising body of knowledge on social media and crisis management. [1] Between October 2017 and January 2018, a review was conducted, which included locating and retrieving records from an electronic database. The outcomes of this study indicated that the rise of social media has altered the landscape of crisis communication by allowing for greater engagement. However, due to its nature, social media might also be used to spark a crisis. This means that the crisis can be both produced and disseminated through social media. Nonetheless, social media's promise as a crisis-resolution tool is undeniable. It has the capability of proving a claim, dispelling false rumors, or just demonstrating a fact. As a result, practitioners should understand how social media works and how to best use it to interact with their stakeholders. This study also includes other findings, limits, and useful suggestions for scholars and practitioners interested in learning more about the role of social media on crisis communication and management. As most of the crisis problem were reported via twitter. However, most of the problem reported and corresponding responses via twitter were not successfully exchanged between victim’s and resource organization. As a result, most of the tweets were not getting help.

A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction (DOI) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network (NN), as well as a multiple linear regression (MLR)-based method to estimate DOI in depolished PET detector arrays with single-sided readout. The algorithms were tested on an 8× 8 array of 1.53× 1.53× 15 mm3 crystals and a 4× 4 array of 3.1× 3.1× 15 mm3 crystals, both made of Ce:LYSO scintillators and coupled to a 4× 4 array of 3× 3 mm3 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Using the conventional linear DOI estimation method resulted in an average DOI resolution of 3.76 mm and 3.51 mm FWHM for the 8× 8 and the 4× 4 arrays, respectively. Application of MLR outperformed the conventional method with average DOI resolutions of 3.25 mm and 3.33 mm FWHM, respectively. Using the machine learning approaches further improved the DOI resolution, to an average DOI resolution of 2.99 mm and 3.14 mm FWHM, respectively, and additionally improved the uniformity of the DOI resolution in both arrays. Lastly, preliminary results obtained by using only a section of the crystal array for training showed that the NN-based methods could be used to reduce the number of calibration steps required for each detector array.",2020,2020-06-22,16.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001a939e1ac64f7280fb08ec7c3e43936ae23f34

10.1371/journal.pone.0142753,miRLocator: Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Mature MicroRNAs within Plant Pre-miRNA Sequences,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding RNA that play regulatory roles in a wide variety of biological processes, such as plant growth and abiotic stress responses. Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. To address the class imbalance problem (few real miRNAs and a large number of pseudo miRNAs), the prediction models in miRLocator were optimized by considering critical (and often ignored) factors that can markedly affect the prediction accuracy of mature miRNAs, including the machine learning algorithm and the ratio between training positive and negative samples. Ten-fold cross-validation on 5854 experimentally validated miRNAs from 19 plant species showed that miRLocator performed better than the state-of-art miRNA predictor miRdup in locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. miRLocator will aid researchers interested in discovering miRNAs from model and non-model plant species.",2015,2015-11-11,26.0,21.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001c15accd39827ecf9838d496b7e44e9f890ee7
10.1186/s12885-021-08704-9,Identifying novel transcript biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using RNA-Seq datasets and machine learning,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the world owing to limitations in its prognosis. The current prognosis approaches include radiological examination and detection of serum biomarkers, however, both have limited efficiency and are ineffective in early prognosis. Due to such limitations, we propose to use RNA-Seq data for evaluating putative higher accuracy biomarkers at the transcript level that could help in early prognosis. To identify such potential transcript biomarkers, RNA-Seq data for healthy liver and various HCC cell models were subjected to five different machine learning algorithms: random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and neural networks. Various metrics, namely sensitivity, specificity, MCC, informedness, and AUC-ROC (except for support vector machine) were evaluated. The algorithms that produced the highest values for all metrics were chosen to extract the top features that were subjected to recursive feature elimination. Through recursive feature elimination, the least number of features were obtained to differentiate between the healthy and HCC cell models. From the metrics used, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of the known protein biomarkers for HCC is comparatively lower than complete transcriptomics data. Among the different machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector machine demonstrated the best performance. Using recursive feature elimination on top features of random forest and support vector machine three transcripts were selected that had an accuracy of 0.97 and kappa of 0.93. Of the three transcripts, two were protein coding (PARP2–202 and SPON2–203) and one was a non-coding transcript (CYREN-211). Lastly, we demonstrated that these three selected transcripts outperformed randomly taken three transcripts (15,000 combinations), hence were not chance findings, and could then be an interesting candidate for new HCC biomarker development. Using RNA-Seq data combined with machine learning approaches can aid in finding novel transcript biomarkers. The three biomarkers identified: PARP2–202, SPON2–203, and CYREN-211, presented the highest accuracy among all other transcripts in differentiating the healthy and HCC cell models. The machine learning pipeline developed in this study can be used for any RNA-Seq dataset to find novel transcript biomarkers.

This study investigated and analyzed particulate matter data from Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Jeollanam-do, with a particular focus on PM2.5. Descriptive statistics, box-and-whisker plots, correlation matrices, time variations, and trend analyses were performed for this purpose. Additionally, a prediction model for PM2.5 concentrations was developed using machine learning techniques, through which future changes in air quality were forecasted. 
Calculations were performed using R-based programs and R packages. Hourly PM2.5 data were obtained from air quality monitoring sites in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon. After data preprocessing, the optimal prediction model was constructed using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine from various machine learning algorithms. 
The research results showed that there was more PM2.5 pollution in Gwangyang compared to Yeosu and Suncheon. The PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly across each monitoring site. Among the monitoring sites, the Yeosu site showed a higher correlation in PM2.5 with each other than other sites. Late winter and early spring showed higher PM2.5 concentrations, while summer and autumn showed lower concentrations. Weekly PM2.5 concentration fluctuations were not significantly different. Daily fluctuations showed an increase in PM2.5 concentrations during times of traffic congestion and a decrease in the afternoon. During the research period, the trend of PM2.5 concentration was generally decreasing. 
The accuracy of the prediction model through machine learning was over 90%, and it is expected to assist in establishing effective response strategies for future changes in air quality.

A postural habit that has been formed cannot be changed easily. It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system.",2018,2018-08-01,48.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ca235cae845677c82167c21cbfa9eabddbfbc

10.1371/journal.pone.0272991,Semantic textual similarity for modern standard and dialectal Arabic using transfer learning,"Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is the task of identifying the semantic correlation between two sentences of the same or different languages. STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set.",2022,2022-08-11,4.0,38.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ce6614288b92f436756e13219135d87cac363

Neuroimaging and machine learning approaches provide new research directions to explore the brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms after stroke. We applied machine learning to predict the classification of the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for motor improvement and identify the neuroimaging features, in order to explore brain functional reorganization and acupuncture mechanisms for motor recovery after stroke. Methods In this study, 49 patients with unilateral motor pathway injury (basal ganglia and/or corona radiata) after ischemic stroke were included and evaluated the motor function by Fugl–Meyer Assessment scores (FMA) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up sessions. Patients were divided by the difference between the twice FMA scores into one group showing minimal clinically important difference (MCID group, n = 28) and the other group with no minimal clinically important difference (N-MCID, n = 21). Machine learning was performed by PRoNTo software to predict the classification of the patients and identify the feature brain regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, a matched group of healthy controls (HC, n = 26) was enrolled. Patients and HC underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination in the resting state and in the acupuncture state (acupuncture at the Yanglingquan point on one side) to compare the differences in brain functional connectivity (FC) and acupuncture effects. Results Through machine learning, we obtained a balance accuracy rate of 75.51% and eight feature ROIs. Compared to HC, we found that the stroke patients with lower FC between these feature ROIs with other brain regions, while patients in the MCID group exhibited a wider range of lower FC. When acupuncture was applied to Yanglingquan (GB 34), the abnormal FC of patients was decreased, with different targets of effects in different groups. Conclusion Feature ROIs identified by machine learning can predict the classification of stroke patients with different motor improvements, and the FC between these ROIs with other brain regions is decreased. Acupuncture can modulate the bilateral cerebral hemispheres to restore abnormal FC via different targets, thereby promoting motor recovery after stroke.

Significance Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms have rapidly become much more widespread for numerous biomedical applications, including the diagnosis and categorization of disease and injury. Aim Here, we seek to characterize the recent growth of ML techniques that use imaging data to classify burn wound severity and report on the accuracies of different approaches. Approach To this end, we present a comprehensive literature review of preclinical and clinical studies using ML techniques to classify the severity of burn wounds. Results The majority of these reports used digital color photographs as input data to the classification algorithms, but recently there has been an increasing prevalence of the use of ML approaches using input data from more advanced optical imaging modalities (e.g., multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography), in addition to multimodal techniques. The classification accuracy of the different methods is reported; it typically ranges from ∼70% to 90% relative to the current gold standard of clinical judgment. Conclusions The field would benefit from systematic analysis of the effects of different input data modalities, training/testing sets, and ML classifiers on the reported accuracy.

Their unobtrusive nature and ability to provide reliable heart rate measurements facilitate the estimation of cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes, as quantified by maximum consumption of oxygen uptake. Previous studies have employed data-driven models which use heart rate information to estimate the cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes. This signifies the physiological relevance of heart rate and heart rate variability for the estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. In this work, the heart rate variability features that were extracted from both exercise and recovery segments were fed to three different Machine Learning models to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of 856 athletes performing Graded Exercise Testing. A total of 101 features from exercise and 30 features from recovery segments were given as input to three feature selection methods to avoid overfitting of the models and to obtain relevant features. This resulted in the increase of model’s accuracy by 5.7% for exercise and 4.3% for recovery. Further, post-modelling analysis was performed to remove the deviant points in two cases, initially in both training and testing and then only in training set, using k-Nearest Neighbour. In the former case, the removal of deviant points led to a reduction of 19.3% and 18.0% in overall estimation error for exercise and recovery, respectively. In the latter case, which mimicked the real-world scenario, the average R value of the models was observed to be 0.72 and 0.70 for exercise and recovery, respectively. From the above experimental approach, the utility of heart rate variability to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of large population of athletes was validated. Additionally, the proposed work contributes to the utility of cardiorespiratory fitness assessment of athletes through wearable heart rate monitors.",2023,2023-03-01,2.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d9b4e71b4031ecf7dd4b7bb6e32ac45102eca

10.3390/genes14091695,Identification of Potential Sex-Specific Biomarkers in Pigs with Low and High Intramuscular Fat Content Using Integrated Bioinformatics and Machine Learning,"Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a key determinant of pork quality. Controlling the genetic and physiological factors of IMF and the expression patterns of various genes is important for regulating the IMF content and improving meat quality in pig breeding. Growing evidence has suggested the role of genetic factors and breeds in IMF deposition; however, research on the sex factors of IMF deposition is still lacking. The present study aimed to identify potential sex-specific biomarkers strongly associated with IMF deposition in low- and high-IMF pig populations. The GSE144780 expression dataset of IMF deposition-related genes were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in male and female low-IMF (162 DEGs, including 64 up- and 98 down-regulated genes) and high-IMF pigs (202 DEGs, including 147 up- and 55 down-regulated genes). Moreover, hub genes were screened via PPI network construction. Furthermore, hub genes were screened for potential sex-specific biomarkers using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator machine learning algorithm, and sex-specific biomarkers in low-IMF (troponin I (TNNI1), myosin light chain 9(MYL9), and serpin family C member 1(SERPINC1)) and high-IMF pigs (CD4 molecule (CD4), CD2 molecule (CD2), and amine oxidase copper-containing 2(AOC2)) were identified, and then verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in semimembranosus muscles. Additionally, the gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of hallmark gene sets were collectively performed on the identified biomarkers. Finally, the transcription factor-biomarker and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (biomarker) networks were predicted. The identified potential sex-specific biomarkers may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of IMF deposition and the beneficial foundation for improving meat quality in pig breeding.",2023,2023-08-25,2.0,81.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e4348bf3ea69ac952c0078282041986cdec3d

10.3390/rs14112676,Automated Multi-Scale and Multivariate Geological Logging from Drill-Core Hyperspectral Data,"Hyperspectral drill-core scanning adds value to exploration campaigns by providing continuous, high-resolution mineralogical data over the length of entire boreholes. However, multivariate mineralogical data must be transformed into lithological domains such that it is compatible with interpolation techniques and be usable for geomodeling. Manual interpretation of multivariate drill-core data is a challenging, time-consuming and subjective task, and automated or semi-automated approaches are needed. However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection. In this way, the correlation pattern between the variables is incorporated into the segmentation. The scalogram accurately locates the geological boundaries at depth and yields hierarchical geological domains with mineralogical composition characteristics. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a synthetic as well as a real multivariate dataset. The real dataset consists of mineral abundances derived from drill-core hyperspectral imaging data acquired in Elvira, a shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D. Our approach provides an automatic way to transform hyperspectral image-derived mineral maps into vertically coherent geological units that are appropriate inputs for 3D geological modeling workflows. Moreover, the method improves the boundary detection and geological domaining by making use of multivariate information.",2022,2022-06-02,13.0,27.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e8d27211bfbc49a09b646e6fdfdffb798d8cd

10.1038/s41598-024-61443-2,Adaptive recognition of machining features in sheet metal parts based on a graph class-incremental learning strategy,"The integration of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided process planning (CAPP), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems is significantly enhanced by employing deep learning-based automatic feature recognition (AFR) methods. These methods outperform traditional, rule-based approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of intersecting features. However, existing deep learning-based AFR methods face two major challenges. The initial challenge stems from the frequent utilization of voxelized or point-cloud representations of CAD models, resulting in the unfortunate loss of valuable geometric and topological information inherent in original Boundary representation (B-Rep) models. The second challenge involves the limitation of supervised deep learning methods in identifying machining features that are not present in the predefined dataset. This constraint renders them suboptimal for the continually evolving datasets of real industrial scenarios. To address the first challenge, this study introduces a graph-structured language, Multidimensional Attributed Face-Edge Graph (maFEG), crafted to encapsulate the intricate geometric and topological details of CAD models. Furthermore, a graph neural network, Sheet-metalNet, is proposed for the efficient learning and interpretation of maFEGs. To tackle the second challenge, a three-component incremental learning strategy is proposed: an initial phase of pre-training and fine-tuning, a prototype sampling-based replay, and a stage employing knowledge distillation for parameter regularization. The effectiveness of Sheet-metalNet and its complementary incremental learning strategy is evaluated using the open-source MFCAD++ dataset and the newly created SMCAD dataset. Experimental results show that Sheet-metalNet surpasses state-of-the-art AFR methods in machining feature recognition accuracy. Moreover, Sheet-metalNet demonstrates adaptability to dynamic dataset changes, maintaining high performance when encountering newly introduced features, thanks to its innovative incremental learning strategy.",2024,2024-05-09,1.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ebb9f4f55c4e4e139d8c14d13808d6b5f6ba1

Therefore, the spectral pre-processing method of spectral-to-spectral ratio (S/S), as well as multiple characteristic wavelength member model fusion (MCMF) and characteristic wavelength and non-characteristic wavelength member model fusion (CNCMF) methods, were proposed for improving the detection performance of apple whole fruit SSC by diffuse reflection (DR), diffuse transmission (DT) and full transmission (FT) spectra. The modeling analysis showed that the S/S- partial least squares regression models for all three mode spectra had high prediction performance. After competitive adaptive reweighted sampling characteristic wavelength screening, the prediction performance of all three model spectra was improved. The particle swarm optimization–extreme learning machine models of MCMF and CNCMF had the most significant enhancement effect and could make all three mode spectra have high prediction performance.

10.1192/bjo.2024.440,Statistical Machine Learning Methods to Handle Missing PHQ-8 Score – Assuming Missing at Random,"Aims Missing data is a challenge that most researchers encounter. It is a concern that continues to be analyzed and addressed for solutions. Missing data occurs when there is no data stored for certain variables relating to participants. In health surveys, when participants answer in the form of “I don't know” or “I'd prefer not to answer”, these responses can, in many cases, be categorized as missing data responses from a participant in a specific category or question. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is an essential tool in healthcare and clinical settings to assess an individual's mental health, specifically related to symptoms of depression. The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with the total score obtained by summing the scores for each item. Higher PHQ-8 scores indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. We used empirical data from a previous study on depression symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease to study the effect of considering the answers “I do not know” and “I prefer not to answer” as missing values when estimating the percentage of depression using PHQ-8. Moreover, we studied the effect of the complete case analysis and multiple imputation on parameter estimates and confidence intervals. The outcome of this study aims to shed light on the development of missing data procedural knowledge and provide methodological support for public health decision-making when data with missing values are collected. Furthermore, this study aims to prevent the exclusion of missing data rather than to generate data. Methods A simulation study with 1000 replicates was performed. Four common statistical machine learning methods for handling missing values were included in this study. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-Means, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest (RF) imputations. Five clusters were used for KNN and K-mean. Likewise, five multiple imputations were used for the CART and RF methods. The simulation was based on publicly available data with available PHQ-8 data for 1096 subjects. In the simulation study and for each replication, multivariate missing values were generated using the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% proportions of missingness. The percent of depression was calculated using the PHQ-8 questionnaire and a comparison was made between estimated actual depression, complete-case analysis, KNN, Kmean, RF, and CART, respectively. Results The Median age of the subjects was 69 (interquartile range: 61–67) and more males (72.9%) than females were included in the data. The estimated actual depression was 16.8, whereas the estimated percentage of depression varies between 6.9–13.5, 16.2–16.7, 16.3–16.7, 16.6–16.7 and 16.7–16.8 for the complete case, KNN, Kmean, RF and CART respectively. Conclusion The results of this simulation study show that missing PHQ-8 data are best handled by applying multiple imputations based on CART or RF. However, using K-Means or KNN leads to a good estimate of the true percentage of depression. Furthermore, the results of this simulation study show that complete-case analysis leads to biased estimates of the true percentage of depression. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to address the problem of missing PHQ-8 data under the assumption of missing not at random.",2024,2024-06-01,0.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00208549d427e2c8e8e9e33cad0647915314fc3a

Thus, data augmentation methods have been developed to improve classifiers by artificially created training data. In NLP, there is the challenge of establishing universal rules for text transformations which provide new linguistic patterns. In this paper, we present and evaluate a text generation method suitable to increase the performance of classifiers for long and short texts. We achieved promising improvements when evaluating short as well as long text tasks with the enhancement by our text generation method. Especially with regard to small data analytics, additive accuracy gains of up to 15.53% and 3.56% are achieved within a constructed low data regime, compared to the no augmentation baseline and another data augmentation technique. As the current track of these constructed regimes is not universally applicable, we also show major improvements in several real world low data tasks (up to +4.84 F1-score). Since we are evaluating the method from many perspectives (in total 11 datasets), we also observe situations where the method might not be suitable.

Therefore, to find an efficient and fast real-time disease image recognition method is very meaningful. Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that can automatically learn representative features to achieve better results in areas of image recognition. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use deep learning methods to identify crop pests and diseases and to find efficient and fast real-time image recognition methods of disease. Deep learning is a newly developed discipline in recent years. Its purpose is to study how to actively obtain a variety of feature representation methods from data samples and rely on data-driven methods, a series of nonlinear transformations are applied to finally collect the original data from specific to abstract, from general to specified semantics, and from low-level to high-level characteristic forms. This paper analyzes the classical and the latest neural network structure based on the theory of deep learning. For the problem that the network based on natural image classification is not suitable for crop pest and disease identification tasks, this paper has improved the network structure that can take care of both recognition speed and recognition accuracy. We discussed the influence of the crop pest and disease feature extraction layer on recognition performance. Finally, we used the inner layer as the main structure to be the pest and disease feature extraction layer by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the inner and global average pooling layers. We analyze various loss functions such as Softmax Loss, Center Loss, and Angular Softmax Loss for pest identification. In view of the shortcomings of difficulty in loss function training, convergence, and operation, making the distance between pests and diseases smaller and the distance between classes more greater improved the loss function and introduced techniques such as feature normalization and weight normalization.

10.5194/amt-15-7211-2022,High-fidelity retrieval from instantaneous line-of-sight returns of nacelle-mounted lidar including supervised machine learning,"Abstract. Wind turbine applications that leverage nacelle-mounted
Doppler lidar are hampered by several sources of uncertainty in the lidar
measurement, affecting both bias and random errors. Two problems encountered
especially for nacelle-mounted lidar are solid interference due to
intersection of the line of sight with solid objects behind, within, or in
front of the measurement volume and spectral noise due primarily to
limited photon capture. These two uncertainties, especially that due to
solid interference, can be reduced with high-fidelity retrieval techniques
(i.e., including both quality assurance/quality control and subsequent
parameter estimation). Our work compares three such techniques, including
conventional thresholding, advanced filtering, and a novel application of
supervised machine learning with ensemble neural networks, based on their
ability to reduce uncertainty introduced by the two observed nonideal
spectral features while keeping data availability high. The approach
leverages data from a field experiment involving a continuous-wave (CW)
SpinnerLidar from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) that provided
scans of a wide range of flows both unwaked and waked by a field turbine.
Independent measurements from an adjacent meteorological tower within the
sampling volume permit experimental validation of the instantaneous velocity
uncertainty remaining after retrieval that stems from solid interference and
strong spectral noise, which is a validation that has not been performed
previously. All three methods perform similarly for non-interfered returns,
but the advanced filtering and machine learning techniques perform better
when solid interference is present, which allows them to produce overall
standard deviations of error between 0.2 and 0.3 m s−1, or a 1 %–22 %
improvement versus the conventional thresholding technique, over the rotor
height for the unwaked cases. Between the two improved techniques, the
advanced filtering produces 3.5 % higher overall data availability, while
the machine learning offers a faster runtime (i.e., ∼ 1 s
to evaluate) that is therefore more commensurate with the requirements of
real-time turbine control. The retrieval techniques are described in terms
of application to CW lidar, though they are also relevant to pulsed lidar.
Previous work by the authors (Brown and Herges, 2020) explored a novel
attempt to quantify uncertainty in the output of a high-fidelity lidar
retrieval technique using simulated lidar returns; this article provides
true uncertainty quantification versus independent measurement and does so
for three techniques rather than one.

10.3390/app13095737,Applying the DEMATEL−ANP Fuzzy Comprehensive Model to Evaluate Public Opinion Events,"Network public opinion is a mirror reflecting people’s will, and evaluating its urgency can help to find hidden social crises. Research on public opinion in the field of machine learning usually focuses on micro-sentiment judgment, which is unable to offer support for the evaluation of public opinion events without additional data, and research from the perspective of artificial weighting has the disadvantage of the confusion of explanation. Judging the urgency of public opinion events is usually based on human perception, which is fuzzy and conforms to the attribute of fuzzy mathematics. Therefore, the index system in this paper was constructed in line with five principles, from which the weights were scientifically evaluated by integrating the DEMATEL and ANP model, and fuzzy mathematics was applied to determine the urgency level of public opinion. The result has three-fold significance. First, the index system constructed was more closely linked. Second, the integration of the DEMATEL and ANP weight calculating model took the interdependence of indicators fully into account. Third, fuzzy mathematics provided support for determining the public opinion crisis level, especially in the absence of immediate dissemination data.",2023,2023-05-06,3.0,16.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0022e5a46097180bf7c98c038c14d48631acb150

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from proximal sensors and the high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provide an opportunity to monitor the crop water status efficiently. Based on data from an experimental tomato field with intensive aerial and plant-based measurements, we developed random forest machine learning regression models to estimate tomato stem water potential (ψ stem), (using observations from proximal sensors and 12-band UAV imagery, respectively, along with weather data. The proximal sensor-based model estimation agreed well with the plant ψ stem with R 2 of 0.74 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.63 bars. The model included PRI, normalized difference vegetation index, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature and tracked well with the seasonal dynamics of ψ stem across different plots. A separate model, built with multiple vegetation indices (VIs) from UAV imagery and weather variables, had an R 2 of 0.81 and MAE of 0.67 bars. The plant-level ψ stem maps generated from UAV imagery closely represented the water status differences of plots under different irrigation treatments and also tracked well the temporal change among flights. PRI was found to be the most important VI in both the proximal sensor- and the UAV-based models, providing critical information on tomato plant water status. This study demonstrated that machine learning models can accurately estimate the water status by integrating PRI, other VIs, and weather data, and thus facilitate data-driven irrigation management for processing tomatoes.",2023,2023-04-06,6.0,87.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00233edfe560e68440abb54ec536340659c4e1d7

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a washing procedure that guarantees effective and safe cleaning. This organization recommends that States promote this activity and monitor it continuously. Based on this fact, this article presents a work oriented to study the feasibility of identifying the moments in which a person carried out a hand washing, determining its beginning and duration, as well as if these washings were compliant with the WHO guidelines. The identification of washing moments is made through the analysis, by means of Machine Learning techniques, of the data that can be collected from the inertial sensors of the smartwatch the person is wearing. This study was carried out with the participation of 15 volunteers. Data was not only collected in controlled settings but, also, more than 600 hours of sensor measurements come from free-live conditions. The results of the study showed that it is feasible to build a solid solution based on the use of low cost wearables for the identification of washing moments. The solution is very effective (with F1 over 95%) with user-dependent models. Also, with user-independent models, the identification of WHO washings is also very effective (with F1 above 85%), but more limited in the detection of free washings (F1 around 55%).",2021,,4.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00238985ff4816a79a13c1c6a7fccfe3661e658a

This study retrospectively investigated newly diagnosed cases of MBNs from our laboratory to investigate mutation landscapes in Chinese patients with MBNs and to combine mutational information and machine learning (ML) into clinical applications for MBNs, especially for subtype classification. Methods Samples from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database were collected for ML model construction and cases from our laboratory were used for ML model validation. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation Random Forest algorithm was used for ML model construction. Mutation detection was performed by NGS and tumor cell size was confirmed by cell morphology and/or flow cytometry in our laboratory. Results Totally 849 newly diagnosed MBN cases from our laboratory were retrospectively identified and included in mutational landscape analyses. Patterns of gene mutations in a variety of MBN subtypes were found, important to investigate tumorigenesis in MBNs. A long list of novel mutations was revealed, valuable to both functional studies and clinical applications. By combining gene mutation information revealed by NGS and ML, we established ML models that provide valuable information for MBN subtype classification. In total, 8895 cases of 8 subtypes of MBNs in the COSMIC database were collected and utilized for ML model construction, and the models were validated on the 849 MBN cases from our laboratory. A series of ML models was constructed in this study, and the most efficient model, with an accuracy of 0.87, was based on integration of NGS testing and tumor cell sizes. Conclusions The ML models were of great significance in the differential diagnosis of all cases and different MBN subtypes.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stage of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this, we proposed a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. In general we have six machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, classifier and feed forward neural network to establish models. In existing system random forest achieved the performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. In proposed system, By analysing the misjudgments generated by the above model, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron which could achieve an efficient accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.

The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy.

The severity of MS disease is monitored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, composed of several functional sub-scores. Early and accurate classification of MS disease severity is critical for slowing down or preventing disease progression via applying early therapeutic intervention strategies. Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) create opportunities to apply data-driven and predictive modeling tools for this goal. Previous studies focusing on using single-modal machine learning and deep learning algorithms were limited in terms of prediction accuracy due to data insufficiency or model simplicity.

Our contribution has two main facets. First, we describe a pioneering effort to integrate structured EHR data, neuroimaging data and clinical notes to build a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict patient’s MS severity. The proposed pipeline demonstrates up to 19% increase in terms of the area under the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) compared to models using single-modal data.

There is a major gap between a model that looks good on paper and a model that performs well in the drug discovery process. We are trying to shrink this gap by introducing the Evaluation Framework For predicting Efficiency of Cancer Treatment (EFFECT) benchmark suite based on the DepMap and GDSC data sets to facilitate the creation of well-applicable machine learning models capable of predicting gene essentiality and/or drug sensitivity on in vitro cancer cell lines.

Testing the EFFECT suite on a few popular machine learning (ML) models showed that while library-standard non-linear models have measurable performance in splits representing precision medicine and target identification tasks, the actual corrected correlations are rather low, showing that even simple knock-out (KO)/drug sensitivity prediction is a yet unsolved task.

After inducing motion and extracting 105 radiomic features in 4 feature sets, including shape, first-, second-, and higher-order statistics features from each region of interest (ROI) of the phantom image, statistical analyses were performed to select robust features against motion. Subsequently, these robust features and a total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from 126 clinical data. Various feature selection (FS) and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers were implemented to predict the LVI of NSCLC, followed by comparing the results of predicting LVI using robust features with common conventional techniques not considering the robustness of radiomic features. Results Our results demonstrated that selecting robust features as input to FS algorithms and ML classifiers surges the sensitivity, which has a gentle negative effect on the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) of predictions compared with commonly used methods in 12 of 15 outcomes. The top performance of the LVI prediction was achieved by the NB classifier and RFE FS without considering the robustness of radiomic features with 95% area under the curve of AUC, 67% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, the top performance of the LVI prediction using robust features belonged to the NB classifier and Boruta feature selection with 92% AUC, 86% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Conclusion Robustness over various influential factors is critical and should be considered in a radiomic study. Selecting robust features is a solution to overcome the low reproducibility of radiomic features. Although setting robust features against motion in a phantom study has a minor negative impact on the accuracy and AUC of LVI prediction, it boosts the sensitivity of prediction to a large extent.",2025,2025-03-12,0.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0025c929a79041661d68d3ae38c723bc56c256d0

However, building a Machine learning model from scratch to classify Thai cultural images can be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data. In this study, we investigate the use of transfer learning for the task of image classification on a dataset of Thai cultural images. We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration. To better understand the reasoning behind the predictions made by the models, we deployed the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique to generate heatmaps that the models attend to when making predictions.

This is a difficult question that was addressed carefully in a recent paper that focused on the validity of the GRACE score to predict in-hospital mortality. (1) Why is this high-quality study by Mangariello and Gitelman important? Prediction models are increasingly published in the medical literature. Newer methods are proposed, such as labeled machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. Whatever the method of development, the key issue is whether the prediction model or algorithm provides valid predictions for physicians and their patients who rely on them as a source of information and decision making. Indeed, the authors rightly argue that many differences between settings may be present. These include differences in patient characteristics, healthcare systems, and socioeconomic environment. Moreover, treatment may change over time. All these differences may make a previously developed model not valid for the particular setting where the model is applied, for example the Dr. Juan A. Fernández Hospital in Buenos Aires. Therefore, a model may need updating for a specific setting.

First, to improve data quality, we preprocessed the data via interpolation and normalization. Next, to ensure the description integrity of model input, we extracted nine time-domain features based on the statistical characteristics of sEMG signals over time.

Three potential biomarkers (SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2) were screened using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning based on sialylation-related genes. Moreover, the combined model of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2 showed excellent diagnostic value in both the training and validation cohorts. Importantly, a Sial-score was constructed based on the expression of SERPINB2, TFPI2, and SLC9B2. The Sial-low group showed a lower level of immune infiltration than the Sial-high group. Anti-TNF therapy was effective for 94.4% of patients in the Sial-low group but only 15.8% in the Sial-high group. The Sial-score had an outstanding ability to predict and distinguish between responders and non-responders.

The Baekje weir in South Korea presents an interesting case as the weir has undergone full gate opening, which is generally not the case for weirs and reservoirs, providing valuable opportunity for simulating weir removal conditions. The main objectives are investigation of groundwater level fluctuations under various weir operations, distances from the weir, and seasonal variations. The study utilizes observed data that simulates conditions with and without the weir, including scenarios of full gate opening. Multiple machine learning algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—are used to develop accurate groundwater level prediction models. The models' performance is assessed using coefficient of determination, Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indices, and visualized through Taylor diagrams. Results indicate that XGBoost outperforms other models in all three groups during both training and testing phases. Specifically, XGBoost surpasses RF by 2.09% (R2), 5.66% (RMSE), and 10.1% (MAE) in training, and outperforms SVR by 11.2% (R2), 42.0% (RMSE), and 129.2% (MAE) in testing.

10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2892970,In-Bed Pose Estimation: Deep Learning With Shallow Dataset,"This paper presents a robust human posture and body parts detection method under a specific application scenario known as in-bed pose estimation. Although the human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied extensively in the last few decades, the in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose estimation problems. However, the in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes with specific challenges, including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout the day and having pose distribution different from the common human surveillance viewpoint. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly reduce the effectiveness of the existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge, the infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with the unconventional pose perspective, a 2- end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. The deep learning framework proves to be the most effective model in human pose estimation; however, the lack of large public dataset for in-bed poses prevents us from using a large network from scratch. In this paper, we explored the idea of employing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-tuning the model using our own shallow (limited in size and different in perspective and color) in-bed IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-trained CNN called convolutional pose machine (CPM) was fine-tuned for in-bed pose estimation by re-training its specific intermediate layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.",2017,2017-11-03,57.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0027ccaf4960be6b6c3864513eee34b7a9c7b699

Clients who want to classify their data send them to a server that performs their inference using a trained model. The client must trust the server and provide the data in plaintext. Moreover, if the classification is done at a third-party cloud service, the model owner also needs to trust the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privately evaluating decision trees. The protocol uses a novel private comparison function based on fully homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) scheme and a programmable bootstrapping technique. Our comparison function for 32-bit and 64-bit integers is 26% faster than the naive TFHE implementation. The protocol is designed to be non-interactive and is less complex than the existing interactive protocols. Our experiment results show that our technique scales linearly with the depth of the decision tree and efficiently evaluates large decision trees on real datasets. Compared with the state of the art, ours is the only non-interactive protocol to evaluate a decision tree with high precision on encrypted parameters.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian mixture (GM) clustering, are implemented to label features on a collection of XRF maps of human atherosclerotic plaque samples. The investigation involves the hard X‐Ray nanoprobe (NanoMAX) at MAX IV synchrotron radiation facility, utilizing scanning transmission X‐Ray microscopy (STXM) and XRF techniques. The analysis covers regions of interest scanned by the beam with a step size of 200 nm, yielding XRF maps of elements like calcium, iron, and zinc. These maps reveal intricate structures unsuitable for manual labeling. However, they can be accurately classified in an automated fashion using GM. Prior to clustering, PCA is used to deal with repeated patterns and background areas. The resulting clusters are associated with different types of features, which can be identified as specific tissues confirmed by histology. Regions of high concentrations of phosphorus, sulfur, calcium, and iron are found in the samples.

Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are used to inform citizens about the political stances of the parties that involved in the upcoming elections, in an effort to facilitate their decision making process and increase their participation in this democratic process. VAA is a Web application that calls the users and parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, which are based on the current affairs of their country and then it recommends to each user the party that better fits their political views. SVAAs, a social recommendation approach of VAAs, on the other hand, base their recommendation on the VAA community of users in a collaborative filtering manner. In this paper we resort to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of SVAAs. In particular, we try to model party-supporters using HMMs and then use these models to recommend each VAA user the party whose model best fits his/her answer sequence of the VAA policy statements. HMMs proved to be effective machine learning tools for sequential and correlated data and this is the main rationale behind this study. VAA policy statements are usually correlated and grouped into categories such as external policy, economy, society, etc. As a result, opting from the various answer choices in each policy statement might be related with selections in previous and subsequent policy statements. Given that the order of policy statements is kept fixed within each VAA one can assume that (a) answer patterns (sequences of choices for all policy statements included in the VAA) can be found that characterise ‘typical’ voters of particular parties, and (b) the answer choice in each policy statement can be ‘predicted’ from previous answer choices.

Given the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges of employing children, young adults (18–40) can serve as suitable substitutes due to the similarity in their taste sensitivity. Taste panellists need not be experts in sensory evaluation so long as a reference product is used during evaluation; however, they should be screened for bitterness taste detection thresholds. For a more robust evaluation during the developmental phase, considerations of a scoring system and the calculation of an acceptance value may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of recommending a formulation for further development. On the technological front, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be exploited in taste-masking optimisation of medicinal formulations as they can model complex relationships between variables and enable predictions not possible previously to optimise product profiles. Machine learning classifiers may therefore tackle the challenge of predicting the bitterness intensity of paediatric formulations. While advancements have been made, further work is needed to identify effective taste-masking techniques for specific drug molecules. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms, using human panellist acceptability scores, can aid in enhancing paediatric formulation development and overcoming taste-masking challenges.",2023,2023-08-01,4.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028a595d2a9cfdd693befc5939764d4d087da6d

Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid separation)–residue positions distant in sequence, but in close proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL::Fold.

Based on machine learning algorithms, eight key ARGs (ATG4C, BAX, BIRC5, ERBB2, FKBP1B, HIF1A, NCKAP1, and NFKB1) were integrated to establish ARG classifier. The model exhibited excellent diagnostic values (AUC > 0.85) in multiple datasets and multiple points in time and superiorly distinguished sepsis from other critical illnesses. ARG classifier showed significant correlations with clinical characteristics or endotypes and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.70) than other clinical characteristics. Additionally, the identified hub ARGs were significantly associated with immune cell infiltration (B, T, NK, dendritic, T regulatory, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), immune and molecular pathways (inflammation-promoting pathways, HLA, cytolytic activity, apoptosis, type-II IFN response, complement and coagulation cascades), levels of several cytokines (PDGFRB, IL-10, IFNG, and TNF), which indicated that ARG classifier/hub ARGs adequately reflected the immune microenvironment during sepsis. Finally, using clinical specimens, the expression levels of key ARGs in patients with sepsis were found to differ significantly from those of control patients, and ARG classifier exhibited superior diagnostic performance, compared to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion Collectively, a diagnostic and prognostic model (ARG classifier) based on eight ARGs was developed which may assist clinicians in diagnosis of sepsis and recognizing patient at high risk to guide personalized treatment. Additionally, the ARG classifier effectively reflected the immune microenvironment diversity of sepsis and may facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",2022,2022-11-01,15.0,31.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028df26e5831b753f7ae8cdafb379cbd4e78165
10.1186/s13034-022-00554-y,Conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 guideline adherence in adolescent psychiatric outpatients: the predictive role of adverse childhood experiences,"Background Conspiracy beliefs have become widespread throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have shown that endorsing conspiracy beliefs leads to lower protective guideline adherence (i.e., wearing face masks), posing a threat to public health measures. The current study expands this research across the lifespan, i.e., in a sample of adolescents with mental health problems. Here, we investigated the association between conspiracy beliefs and guideline adherence while also exploring the predictors of conspiracy beliefs. Methods N  = 93 adolescent psychiatric outpatients (57% female, mean age: 15.8) were assessed using anonymous paper–pencil questionnaires. Endorsement of generic and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was assessed, in addition to items measuring adherence to protective guidelines and mental health (stress, depressive symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and adverse childhood experiences). Multiple regressions and supervised machine learning (conditional random forests) were used for analyses. Results Fourteen percent of our sample fully endorsed at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory, while protective guidelines adherence was relatively high ( M  = 4.92, on a scale from 1 to 7). The endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs—but not of generic conspiracy beliefs—was associated with lower guideline adherence (β = − 0.32, 95% CI − 0.53 to − 0.11, p  < .001). Conditional random forests suggested that adverse childhood experiences and peer and conduct problems were relevant predictors of both conspiracy belief categories. Conclusion While a significant proportion of our sample of adolescents in psychiatric treatment endorsed conspiracy beliefs, the majority did not. Furthermore, and to some degree, contrary to public perception, we found that adolescents show relatively good adherence to public health measures—even while experiencing a high degree of mental distress. The predictive value of adverse childhood experiences and peer/conduct problems for conspiracy beliefs might be explained by compensatory mechanisms to ensure the safety, structure, and inclusion that conspiracies provide.",2023,2023-01-24,2.0,69.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028eee468b54f20eb190af8787a38199daa24bd

As such, synthetic signals possess known ground truth labels of the underlying disease and can be employed for validation of machine learning ECG analysis tools in addition to clinical signals. Recently, synthetic ECGs were used to enrich sparse clinical data or even replace them completely during training leading to improved performance on real-world clinical test data. We thus generated a novel synthetic database comprising a total of 16,900 12 lead ECGs based on electrophysiological simulations equally distributed into healthy control and 7 pathology classes. The pathological case of myocardial infraction had 6 sub-classes.

For example, they have demonstrated effectiveness at boosted top or W boson identification or for quark/gluon discrimination. We explore these methods for the purpose of classifying jets according to their electric charge. We find that both neural networks that incorporate distance within the jet as an input and boosted decision trees including radial distance information can provide significant improvement in jet charge extraction over current methods. Specifically, convolutional, recurrent, and recursive networks can provide the largest improvement over traditional methods, in part by effectively utilizing distance within the jet or clustering history. The advantages of using a fixed-size input representation (as with the CNN) or a small input representation (as with the RNN) suggest that both convolutional and recurrent networks will be essential to the future of modern machine learning at colliders.",2018,2018-03-21,72.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00297d0c7174c6d1bab91807b4668a358dc1c995

10.3991/ijim.v16i16.31617,A Novel Approach for Product Recommendation Using Smartphone Sensor Data,"Human Activity-based studies have become an omnipresent research topic in Machine Learning. Considering the countless impacts of human activity on persons' everyday life, we have analyzed the correlation between human activity and their product preferences in our study and proposed that daily human activity could be a metric for product recommendation models. To address this previously unaccounted phenomenon, a new approach is presented in our study that gives real-time recommendations to users by observing their activeness in daily life. However, product recommendation systems mostly believe in ratings, and the purchase behavior of users instead of investigating the precious insights of users' daily activities. But we examined smartphones' GPS sensor data using machine learning algorithms to urge insights from users' daily activeness and proposed a model for predicting the product of interest of the purchasers, based on the activeness of their daily life. Moreover, based on our model, we have introduced a prototype of a real-time recommendation system, especially for the retail shops that rely on users' implicit data from smartphone sensors to form product recommendations. For conducting our study, we developed an android application that—collects embedded smartphone sensor data and can detect objects to provide product recommendations and product details. Experiment shows, that our proffered daily activeness-based recommendation system using smartphone sensor data, performs with a precision of 66%, but it is also a promising performance because it does not use customers' explicit feedback.",2022,2022-08-31,1.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0029b6d7f583e0705d1cb9dc16a33bb12a995ad6

However finding effective solution to these problems has been rendered difficult. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents an analytical Machine learning model that suitably combined the graph signature with random forest techniques. This study presents the design and realization of a novel Intelligent Citizenship Identity through family pedigree using Graph Signature based random forest (GSB-RF) model. The study also showcases the development of a novel graph signature technique referred to as Canonical Code Signature(CCS) method. The CCS method is used at the pre-processing stage of the identification process to build signature for any given tuple. Performance comparisim between the present system and the baseline techniques which includes: the K-Nearest Neighbour and the traditional Random Forest shows that the present system outperformed the baseline method studied. The proposed system shows capability to perform continuous re-identification of Citizens based on their family pedigree with ability to select best sample with low computational complexity, high identification accuracy and speed. Our experimental result shows that the precision rate and identification quality of our system in most cases are equal to or greater than 70%. Therefore, the proposed Citizenship Identification machine is capable of providing usable, consistent, efficient, faster and accurate identification, to the users, security agents, government agents and institutions on-line, real-time and at any-time.Keywords- Canonical code,Citizenship Identity, Family pedigree,Graph-Signature,Machine learning, Random-forest",2021,2021-06-29,0.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002a1faea8e778716839dfae54dbd1d2ca54f1df

10.1371/journal.pone.0283933,Application of quantum computing to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model for novel medical knowledge discovery,"Recently, the utilization of real-world medical data collected from clinical sites has been attracting attention. Especially as the number of variables in real-world medical data increases, causal discovery becomes more and more effective. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop new causal discovery algorithms suitable for small data sets for situations where sample sizes are insufficient to detect reasonable causal relationships, such as rare diseases and emerging infectious diseases. This study aims to develop a new causal discovery algorithm suitable for a small number of real-world medical data using quantum computing, one of the emerging information technologies attracting attention for its application in machine learning. In this study, a new algorithm that applies the quantum kernel to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, one of the causal discovery algorithms, is developed. Experiments on several artificial data sets showed that the new algorithm proposed in this study was more accurate than existing methods with the Gaussian kernel under various conditions in the low-data regime. When the new algorithm was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which the causal structure could be correctly estimated even when the amount of data was small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing the new algorithm on real quantum hardware was discussed. This study suggests that the new proposed algorithm using quantum computing might be a good choice among the causal discovery algorithms in the low-data regime for novel medical knowledge discovery.",2021,2021-10-09,6.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002acb7f6823d4b486a6865b18238c2fcc520333

10.1049/ntw2.12098,Evaluating the impact of generative adversarial models on the performance of anomaly intrusion detection,"With the increasing rate and types of cyber attacks against information systems and communication infrastructures, many tools are needed to detect and mitigate against such attacks, for example, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Unfortunately, traditional Signature‐based IDSs (SIDSs) perform poorly against previously unseen adversarial attacks. Anomaly‐based IDSs (AIDSs) use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to overcome these limitations. However, AIDS performance can be poor when trained on imbalanced datasets. To address the challenge of AIDS performance caused by these unbalanced training datasets, generative adversarial models are proposed to obtain adversarial attacks from one side and analyse their quality from another. According to extensive usage and reliability criteria for generative adversarial models in different disciplines, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) are employed to serve AIDS. The authors have extensively assessed their abilities and robustness to deliver high‐quality attacks for AIDS. AIDSs are constructed, trained, and tuned based on these models to measure their impacts. The authors have employed two datasets: NSL‐KDD and CICIDS‐2017 for generalisation purposes, where ML and DL approaches are utilised to implement AIDSs. Their results show that the WGAN model outperformed GANs and BiGAN models in binary and multiclass classifications for both datasets.",2023,2023-08-28,6.0,15.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002af81e9c2ec4361890465809ecdd1dabcaae18

Our system uses a dual Doppler radar mounted onto a restroom ceiling and wall. Machine learning methods, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, support vector machine, and random forest methods, are applied to the Doppler radar data to verify the model’s efficiency and features. Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom.

Despite the overwhelming QCD background, recent advances in jet substructure have put the observation of the gg→H→bb¯$$ gg\to H\to b\overline{b} $$ channel at the LHC within the realm of possibility. In order to enhance the sensitivity to this process, we develop a two-stream convolutional neural network, with one stream acting on jet information and one using global event properties. The neural network significantly increases the discovery potential of a Higgs signal, both for high-pT Standard Model production as well for possible beyond the Standard Model contributions. Unlike most studies for boosted hadronically decaying massive particles, the boosted Higgs search is unique because double b-tagging rejects nearly all background processes that do not have two hard prongs. In this context — which goes beyond state-of-the-art two-prong tagging — the network is studied to identify the origin of the additional information leading to the increased significance. The procedures described here are also applicable to related final states where they can be used to identify additional sources of discrimination power that are not being exploited by current techniques.",2018,2018-07-27,28.0,110.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002b766d7ed4a204f5644877bc2edef8441d76bb

Methods After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. Results This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm explains the individualized predictions.

The iCPH platform combines humanoid robots as “physical twins” of human and “digital twins” that simulates humans and robots in cyber-space. Several critical research topics are introduced to address this challenge by leveraging the advanced model-based analysis together with data-driven learning to exploit collected data from the integrated platform of iCPH. Definition of general description is identified as the first topic as a common basis of contact motions compatible to both humans and humanoids.

Such solutions work as building blocks in forming inoficial access to various domains, suggesting real-time protection and gretaly unclear communications. The conventional paradigm depends heavily on preprepared lists of known malicious domains, necessitating frequent updates to maintain relevance. However, this method shows inadequate in yet-to-be-cataloged malicious or domains identifying emerging, leading to potential vulnerabilities. Throughout this paper, a creative research endeavor is discussed to shed lights on presenting a cutting-edge DNS firewall solution that proves the power of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The major purpose is to use the real-time detection of malicious domain requests, thereby critically enhancing cybersecurity protocols. A reasonable assembled dataset, incorporating 34 intricate features and meticulously recorded instances totaling 90,000, was critically chosen from genuine DNS logs. Similarly, it becomes more riched through the careful integration of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) sources.

When an object is placed on the metasurface, local changes can be detected in one or more of the structure’s meta-atoms. This interaction generally modifies the inductance of the meta-atom, resulting in changes to the overall input impedance of the surface. We derive the properties of the structure and its behaviour in terms of superposition and demonstrate that observing the meta-surface from a single point is sufficient for unambiguous localisation and identification. To model these changes effectively and identify the position of an object, we employ a neural network machine learning algorithm.

10.3390/su15043265,Estimating Flyrock Distance Induced Due to Mine Blasting by Extreme Learning Machine Coupled with an Equilibrium Optimizer,"Blasting is essential for breaking hard rock in opencast mines and tunneling projects. It creates an adverse impact on flyrock. Thus, it is essential to forecast flyrock to minimize the environmental effects. The objective of this study is to forecast/estimate the amount of flyrock produced during blasting by applying three creative composite intelligent models: equilibrium optimizer-coupled extreme learning machine (EO-ELM), particle swarm optimization-based extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). To obtain a successful conclusion, we considered 114 blasting data parameters consisting of eight inputs (hole diameter, burden, stemming length, rock density, charge-per-meter, powder factor (PF), blastability index (BI), and weathering index), and one output parameter (flyrock distance). We then compared the results of different models using seven different performance indices. Every predictive model accomplished the results comparable with the measured values of flyrock. To show the effectiveness of the developed EO-ELM, the result from each model run 10-times is compared. The average result shows that the EO-ELM model in testing (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 32.14, MAE = 19.78, MAPE = 20.37, NSE = 0.93, VAF = 93.97, A20 = 0.57) achieved a better performance as compared to the PSO-ANN model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 64.44, MAE = 36.02, MAPE = 29.96, NSE = 0.72, VAF = 74.72, A20 = 0.33) and PSO-ELM model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 48.55, MAE = 26.97, MAPE = 26.71, NSE = 0.84, VAF = 84.84, A20 = 0.51). Further, a non-parametric test is performed to assess the performance of these three models developed.

We present outcome (‘recovered’, ‘isolated’ or ‘death’) risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over ‘early’ datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used ‘country’, ‘age’ and ‘gender’ as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient’s ‘disease’ history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results The use of a patient’s ‘disease’ history improves the prediction of ‘death’ by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent’s ‘disease’ history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient’s ‘disease’ history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries.",2020,2020-07-02,4.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002f8fa765093bf3df096488f409a209762b7223

Therefore, it is vital to predict NAO events. Since the NAO event can be quantified by the NAO index, an effective neural network model EEMD-ConvLSTM, which is based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), is proposed for NAO index prediction in this paper. EEMD is applied to preprocess NAO index data, which are issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NAO index data are decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). After being filtered by the energy threshold, the remaining IMFs are used to reconstruct new NAO index data as the input of ConvLSTM. In order to evaluate the performance of EEMD-ConvLSTM, six methods were selected as the benchmark, which included traditional models, machine learning algorithms, and other deep neural networks. Furthermore, we forecast the NAO index with EEMD-ConvLSTM and the Rolling Forecast (RF) and compared the results with those of Global Forecast System (GFS) and the averaging of 11 Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model ensemble members (ENSM) provided by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. The experimental results show that EEMD-ConvLSTM not only has the highest reliability from evaluation metrics, but also can better capture the variation trend of the NAO index data.",2019,2019-05-07,27.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003039ed86a5d6d9af3ef164e106752b3ec51820

Mining of symbolic data is more difficult than numerical data due to the lack of inherent geometric properties of this type of data. In this paper, we use two kinds of kernel learning methods to create a kernel estimation model and a nonlinear classification algorithm for symbolic data. By using the kernel smoothing method, we construct a squared-error consistent probability estimator for symbolic data, followed by a new data transformation model proposed to embed symbolic data into Euclidean space. Based on the model, the inner product and distance measure between symbolic data objects are reformulated, allowing a new Support Vector Machine (SVM), called SVM-S, to be defined for nonlinear classification on symbolic data using the Mercer kernel learning method.

Although different solutions have been exercised against phishing, phishing attacks have dramatically increased in the past few years. Recent studies have shown that machine learning has become prominent in the present anti-phishing context, and the techniques like deep learning have extensively improved anti-phishing tools’ detection ability. This paper proposes PhishDet, a new way of detecting phishing websites through Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network and Graph Convolutional Network using URL and HTML features. PhishDet is the first of its kind, which uses the powerful analysis and processing capabilities of Graph Neural Network in the anti-phishing domain and recorded 96.42% detection accuracy, with a 0.036 false-negative rate. It is effective against zero-day attacks, and the average detection time which is 1.8 seconds could also be considered realistic. The feature selection of PhishDet is automatic and occurs inside the system, as PhishDet gradually learns URLs and HTML content features to handle constantly changing phishing attacks. This has outperformed similar solutions by achieving a 99.53% f1-score with a public benchmark dataset. However, PhishDet requires periodic retraining to maintain its performance over time. If such retraining could be facilitated, PhishDet could fight against phishers for a more extended period to safeguard Internet users from this Internet threat.",2022,,23.0,70.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0031e9cbc9568967755617493f525eb852baad2b

10.1007/JHEP09(2020)170,Towards the ultimate differential SMEFT analysis,"We obtain SMEFT bounds using an approach that utilises the complete multi-dimensional differential information of a process. This approach is based on the fact that at a given EFT order, the full angular distribution in the most important electroweak processes can be expressed as a sum of a fixed number of basis functions. The coefficients of these basis functions — the so-called angular moments — and their energy dependance, thus form an ideal set of experimental observables that encapsulates the complete multi-dimensional differential information of the process. This approach is generic and the observables constructed allow to avoid blind directions in the SMEFT parameter space. While this method is applicable to many of the important electroweak processes, as a first example we study the pp → V(ℓℓ)h(bb) process (V ≡ Z/W±, ℓℓ ≡ ℓ+ℓ−/ℓ±ν), including QCD NLO effects, differentially.

To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit. In comparison with other similar types of models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF), the classification accuracy of JMLA is 97.9% on the train set. The accuracy rate on the test set reached 97.6%.

The research has been carried out in cloud computing for resource utilization prediction to overcome over- and under-provisioning issues. Over-provisioning of resources consumes more energy and leads to high costs. However, under-provisioning induces Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and Quality of Service (QoS) degradation.

10.1371/journal.pone.0286311,Machine learning based canine posture estimation using inertial data,"The aim of this study was to design a new canine posture estimation system specifically for working dogs. The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs’ chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed. The dataset and code used are publicly available on Mendeley Data and GitHub, respectively.",2023,2023-06-21,8.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00342ad7d5b47a585e1d802cabb2837d0c05c9a6
10.1017/s1759078724000965,"Neural networks empowered: a machine learning-enabled, Gyro mmID for enhanced virtual reality and motion tracking applications","
 With the emerging developments in millimeter-wave/5G technologies, the potential for wireless Internet of things devices to achieve widespread sensing, precise localization, and high data-rate communication systems becomes increasingly viable. The surge in interest surrounding virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies is attributed to the vast array of applications they enable, ranging from surgical training to motion capture and daily interactions in VR spaces. To further elevate the user experience, and real-time and accurate orientation detection of the user, the authors proposes the utilization of a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system coupled with an ultra-low-power, sticker-like millimeter-wave identification (mmID). The mmID features four backscattering elements, multiplexed in amplitude, frequency, and spatial domains. This design utilizes the training of a supervised learning classification convolutional neural network, enabling accurate real-time three-axis orientation detection of the user. The proposed orientation detection system exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 90.58% over three axes at a distance of 8 m. This high accuracy underscores the precision of the orientation detection system, particularly tailored for medium-range VR/AR applications. The integration of the FMCW-based mmID system with machine learning proves to be a promising advancement, contributing to the seamless and immersive interaction within virtual and augmented environments.",2024,2024-11-13,0.0,3.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00342bbadd38eb967ed257d8567b540d7270efa0

10.1371/journal.pone.0255277,Predicting pain among female survivors of recent interpersonal violence: A proof-of-concept machine-learning approach,"Interpersonal violence (IPV) is highly prevalent in the United States and is a major public health problem. The emergence and/or worsening of chronic pain are known sequelae of IPV; however, not all those who experience IPV develop chronic pain. To mitigate its development, it is critical to identify the factors that are associated with increased risk of pain after IPV. This proof-of-concept study used machine-learning strategies to predict pain severity and interference in 47 young women, ages 18 to 30, who experienced an incident of IPV (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) within three months of their baseline assessment. Young women are more likely than men to experience IPV and to subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Women completed a comprehensive assessment of theory-driven cognitive and neurobiological predictors of pain severity and pain-related interference (e.g., pain, coping, disability, psychiatric diagnosis/symptoms, PTSD/trauma, executive function, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress response). Gradient boosting machine models were used to predict symptoms of pain severity and pain-related interference across time (Baseline, 1-,3-,6- follow-up assessments). Models showed excellent predictive performance for pain severity and adequate predictive performance for pain-related interference. This proof-of-concept study suggests that machine-learning approaches are a useful tool for identifying predictors of pain development in survivors of recent IPV. Baseline measures of pain, family life impairment, neuropsychological function, and trauma history were of greatest importance in predicting pain and pain-related interference across a 6-month follow-up period. Present findings support the use of machine-learning techniques in larger studies of post-IPV pain development and highlight theory-driven predictors that could inform the development of targeted early intervention programs. However, these results should be replicated in a larger dataset with lower levels of missing data.",2021,2021-07-29,5.0,90.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0035763f80fd126ad0d99dd1b964dae9c1986d39

10.1155/vmi/5585458,Machine Learning Techniques Associated With Infrared Thermography to Optimize the Diagnosis of Bovine Subclinical Mastitis,"Bovine subclinical mastitis (SCM) is the costliest disease for the dairy industry. Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14 months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000 cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.",2025,2025-01-01,0.0,30.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00360aaf2043b43dac356cba6e834e6b30188907

10.7759/cureus.42668,Predictive Factors for High Post-void Residual Volume in Older Females After OnabotulinumA Treatment for Severe Overactive Bladder Using a Machine Learning Model,"Introduction Intravesical onabotulinumA injection is actively used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume. The findings contribute to our understanding of onabotulinumA injection treatment for OAB and support evidence-based decision-making using readily available information.",2023,2023-07-01,4.0,27.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003653221d742282482d1a3df6927f69763b47aa

Here, we report a new development of the SAAFEC method, the SAAFEC-SEQ, which is a gradient boosting decision tree machine learning method to predict the change of the folding free energy caused by amino acid substitutions. The method does not require the 3D structure of the corresponding protein, but only its sequence and, thus, can be applied on genome-scale investigations where structural information is very sparse. SAAFEC-SEQ uses physicochemical properties, sequence features, and evolutionary information features to make the predictions. It is shown to consistently outperform all existing state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and root-mean-squared-error parameters as benchmarked on several independent datasets.

Although formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are deemed crucial for research and clinical applications, the fixation process results in molecular damage to nucleic acids, thus confounding their use in genome sequence analysis. Methods to improve genomic data quality from FFPE tissues have emerged, but there remains significant room for improvement.

10.1038/s41431-021-00996-6,A summary-statistics-based approach to examine the role of serotonin transporter promoter tandem repeat polymorphism in psychiatric phenotypes,"In genetic studies of psychiatric disorders in the pre-genome-wide association study (GWAS) era, one of the most commonly studied loci is the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) promoter polymorphism, a 43-base-pair insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The genetic association signals between 5-HTTLPR and psychiatric phenotypes, however, have been inconsistent across many studies. Since the polymorphism cannot be tested via available SNP arrays, we had previously proposed an efficient machine learning algorithm to predict the genotypes of 5-HTTLPR based on the genotypes of eight nearby SNPs, which requires access to individual-level genotype and phenotype data. To utilize the advantage of publicly available GWAS summary statistics obtained from studies with very large sample sizes, we develop a GWAS summary-statistics-based approach for testing the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) associations with various phenotypes. We first cross-verify the accuracy of the summary-statistics-based approach for 61 phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Since we observed a strong similarity between the predicted individual-level 5-HTTLPR genotype-based approach and the summary-statistics-based approach, we applied our method to the available neurobehavioral GWAS summary statistics data obtained from large-scale GWAS. We found no genome-wide significant evidence for association between 5-HTTLPR and any of the neurobehavioral traits. We did observe, however, genome-wide significant evidence for association between this locus and human adult height, BMI, and total cholesterol. Our summary-statistics-based approach provides a systematic way to examine the role of VNTRs and related types of genetic polymorphisms in disease risk and trait susceptibility of phenotypes for which large-scale GWAS summary statistics data are available.",2021,2021-12-23,4.0,28.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003996f234a21693d79a8165b094f4def8550b60

The original degradation in visual quality and inconsistent scale among individual raw images due to different altitude implies that they are not scientifically comparable in their original form. Here, we present analysis-ready images that have already been pre-processed to account for this degradation. We also provide accompanying metadata for each image, which includes their geographic coordinates, depth of the seafloor, absolute scale (cm/pixel), and seafloor habitat class obtained from a previous study. The provided images are thus directly usable by the marine scientific community e.g., to train machine learning models for seafloor substrate classification and megafauna detection.",2023,2023-05-25,1.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003a09c6a52403c9eedd7a68278820eda71225ce

10.1111/1468-2230.12843,Machine Learning and the Re‐Enchantment of the Administrative State,"Machine learning algorithms present substantial promise for more effective decision‐making by administrative agencies. However, some of these algorithms are inscrutable, namely, they produce predictions that humans cannot understand or explain. This trait is in tension with the emphasis on reason‐giving in administrative law. The article explores this tension, advancing two interrelated arguments. First, providing adequate reasons is a significant facet of respecting individuals’ agency. Incorporating inscrutable algorithmic predictions into administrative decision‐making compromises this normative ideal. Second, as a long‐term concern, the use of inscrutable algorithms by administrative agencies may generate systemic effects by gradually reducing the realm of the humanly explainable in public life, a phenomenon Max Weber termed ‘re‐enchantment’. As a result, the use of inscrutable machine learning algorithms might trigger a special kind of re‐enchantment, making us comprehend less rather than more of shared human experience, and consequently altering the way we understand the administrative state and experience public life.",2023,2023-10-08,1.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003ac96deaefc09dee4446f9c10554fb09f6fba7

The Jucazinho Dam, built in 1998, emerged as a response to the scarcity of water in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil. After having less than 1% of its water storage capacity in 2016, the dam recovered in 2020 after interventions by the local water utility. In this context, the reliability of influent flow prediction models for dams becomes crucial for managers. This study proposed hydrological models based on artificial intelligence that aim to generate flow series, and we evaluated the adaptability of these models for the operation of the Jucazinho Dam. Data normalization between 0 and 1 was applied to avoid the predominance of variables with high values. The model was based on machine learning and employed support vector regression (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), as provided by the Python Sklearn library. The selection of the monitoring stations took place via the Brazilian National Water and Sanitation Agency’s (ANA) HIDROWEB portal, and we used Spearman’s correlation to identify the relationship between precipitation and flow. The evaluation of the performance of the model involved graphical analyses and statistical criteria such as the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the percentage of bias (PBIAS), the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean standard deviation ratio (RSR). The results of the statistical coefficients for the test data indicated unsatisfactory performance for long-term predictions (8, 16 and 32 days ahead), revealing a downward trend in the quality of the fit with an increase in the forecast horizon. The SVM model stood out by obtaining the best indices of NSE, PBIAS, R2 and RSR. The graphical results of the SVM models showed underestimation of the flow values with an increase in the forecast horizon due to the sensitivity of the SVM to complex patterns in the time series. On the other hand, the RF and ANN models showed hyperestimation of the flow values as the number of forecast days increased, which was mainly attributed to overfitting. In summary, this study highlights the relevance of artificial intelligence in flow prediction for the efficient management of dams, especially in water scarcity and data-scarce scenarios. A proper choice of models and the ensuring of reliable input data are crucial for obtaining accurate forecasts and can contribute to water security and the effective operation of dams such as Jucazinho.",2024,2024-07-04,2.0,17.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003b1449565f0afd675b7fb59f35693776eb2c77

10.22214/ijraset.2022.46604,Traffic Prediction for Intelligent Transportation System using Machine Learning,"Abstract: Machine learning is a set of algorithms and statistical models that computers use to perform a desired task. Machine learning can be used in many applications such as face detection, speech recognition, medical diagnostics, statistical arbitrage, traffic prediction, etc. The traffic environment includes everything that can affect traffic on the road, whether it is traffic lights, accidents, rallies, or even road repairs that can cause congestion. If we have preconceived information very close to all of the above and the many everyday situations that can affect traffic, the driver or passenger can make an informed decision. It also helps with the future of automotive vehicles. In the present decades, traffic data has been massively generated, and we have moved towards big data concepts for transportation. The to be had site visitors glide forecasting strategies use a few site visitors’ prediction fashions and are nonetheless unsatisfactory to address real-global applications. It is lumbering to figure out the traffic flow precisely since the information accessible for the transportation framework is madly colossal. In this work, we arranged to utilize machine learning, genetic, soft computing, and deep learning algorithms to analyse the big-data for the transportation system with much-reduced complexity. Moreover, Image Processing algorithms are included in traffic sign recognition, which inevitably helps for the right training of autonomous vehicles. In economic years, Mobility GPS has become very popular in big cities in determining traffic percentage with the help of centralized traffic - server management.

A complex system has diverse observation features and complex internal structures, which have been difficult to study with regard to health condition estimation. To describe continuous and gradually changing time-based characteristics of a complex system’s health condition, this study develops a feature selection model based on the information amount and stability. Then, a reliability tree analysis model is designed according to the selected relevant features, the reliability tree is developed using expert knowledge, and the node weight is calculated by the correlation coefficient generated during the feature selection process. Using the simple recurrent unit (SRU), which is a time series machine learning algorithm that achieves a high operating efficiency, the results of the reliability tree analysis are combined to establish a tree-structure SRU (T-SRU) model for complex system health condition estimation. Finally, NASA turbofan engine data are used for verification.

10.2196/12116,Measuring Caloric Intake at the Population Level (NOTION): Protocol for an Experimental Study,"Background The monitoring of caloric intake is an important challenge for the maintenance of individual and public health. The instruments used so far for dietary monitoring (eg, food frequency questionnaires, food diaries, and telephone interviews) are inexpensive and easy to implement but show important inaccuracies. Alternative methods based on wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated from these types of devices. Objective This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable estimate of caloric intake. Methods The study will capture four individual eating activities outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email, flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the University of Padova. Results The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high accuracy. Conclusions Building an automatic calculation method for caloric intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg, for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different segments of the population.

Due to the limitations of current diagnostic tools in these cases, novel approaches must be brought forward to improve treatment outcomes for these patients. The objective of this study was to develop a machine-learning-based software for primary cancer site prediction (OncoOrigin), based on genetic data acquired from tumor DNA sequencing. By design, this was an in silico diagnostic study, conducted using data from the cBioPortal database (accessed on 21 September 2024) and several data processing and machine learning Python libraries.

Despite the growing knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction and ulcerative colitis (UC), the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in UC remains to be fully explored. Methods We integrated 1137 UC colon mucosal samples from 12 multicenter cohorts worldwide to create a normalized compendium. Differentially expressed mitochondria-related genes (DE-MiRGs) in individuals with UC were identified using the “Limma” R package. Unsupervised consensus clustering was utilized to determine the intrinsic subtypes of UC driven by DE-MiRGs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to investigate module genes related to UC. Four machine learning algorithms were utilized for screening DE-MiRGs in UC and construct MiRGs diagnostic models. The models were developed utilizing the over-sampled training cohort, followed by validation in both the internal test cohort and the external validation cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using the Xcell and CIBERSORT algorithms, while potential biological mechanisms were explored through GSVA and GSEA algorithms. Hub genes were selected using the PPI network. Results The study identified 108 DE-MiRGs in the colonic mucosa of patients with UC compared to healthy controls, showing significant enrichment in pathways associated with mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation. The MiRGs diagnostic models for UC were constructed based on 17 signature genes identified through various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities. Utilizing the identified DE-MiRGs from the normalized compendium, 941 patients with UC were stratified into three subtypes characterized by distinct cellular and molecular profiles. Specifically, the metabolic subtype demonstrated enrichment in epithelial cells, the immune-inflamed subtype displayed high enrichment in antigen-presenting cells and pathways related to pro-inflammatory activation, and the transitional subtype exhibited moderate activation across all signaling pathways. Importantly, the immune-inflamed subtype exhibited a stronger correlation with superior response to four biologics: infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and golimumab compared to the metabolic subtype.

10.3389/fnhum.2023.1150120,Pre-trained deep learning models for brain MRI image classification,"Brain tumors are serious conditions caused by uncontrolled and abnormal cell division. Tumors can have devastating implications if not accurately and promptly detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the methods frequently used to detect brain tumors owing to its excellent resolution. In the past few decades, substantial research has been conducted in the field of classifying brain images, ranging from traditional methods to deep-learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). To accomplish classification, machine-learning methods require manually created features. In contrast, CNN achieves classification by extracting visual features from unprocessed images. The size of the training dataset had a significant impact on the features that CNN extracts. The CNN tends to overfit when its size is small. Deep CNNs (DCNN) with transfer learning have therefore been developed. The aim of this work was to investigate the brain MR image categorization potential of pre-trained DCNN VGG-19, VGG-16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 models using data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Validation of the test set utilizing accuracy, recall, Precision, and F1 score showed that the pre-trained VGG-19 model with transfer learning exhibited the best performance.

Despite its widespread use across various fields, the extreme learning machine (ELM) also suffers from multicollinearity issues. To address this challenge, the ridge and Liu estimators, drawn from statistics literature, have been integrated into ELM theory, resulting in a notable advancement. This study aims to further enhance the capabilities of ridge and Liu estimators within the ELM framework by introducing two innovative two-parameter algorithms (TP1-ELM and TP2-ELM) that simultaneously incorporate both estimators. The proposed algorithms undergo comprehensive benchmarking against ELM, ELM-based algorithms, and other commonly used machine learning techniques across seven diverse datasets. Benchmark results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform both ELM-focused approaches and traditional machine learning algorithms on most datasets, yielding more generalizable and stable results. These findings suggest that the proposed algorithms offer a promising alternative to traditional machine learning techniques for regression and classification tasks, particularly in scenarios where multicollinearity is a concern.",2024,,0.0,68.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003fb578fc586082308689f125933f28cc5debc6

10.3390/s21144770,Unsupervised Assessment of Balance and Falls Risk Using a Smartphone and Machine Learning,"Assessment of health and physical function using smartphones (mHealth) has enormous potential due to the ubiquity of smartphones and their potential to provide low cost, scalable access to care as well as frequent, objective measurements, outside of clinical environments. Validation of the algorithms and outcome measures used by mHealth apps is of paramount importance, as poorly validated apps have been found to be harmful to patients. Falls are a complex, common and costly problem in the older adult population. Deficits in balance and postural control are strongly associated with falls risk. Assessment of balance and falls risk using a validated smartphone app may lessen the need for clinical assessments which can be expensive, requiring non-portable equipment and specialist expertise. This study reports results for the real-world deployment of a smartphone app for self-directed, unsupervised assessment of balance and falls risk. The app relies on a previously validated algorithm for assessment of balance and falls risk; the outcome measures employed were trained prior to deployment on an independent data set. Results for a sample of 594 smartphone assessments from 147 unique phones show a strong association between self-reported falls history and the falls risk and balance impairment scores produced by the app, suggesting they may be clinically useful outcome measures.

As the sophistication of malware continues to increase, the demand for innovative approaches to improve detection capabilities become paramount. Machine learning/Deep learning models are being increasingly used for Malware Detection, however one of the most important and frequently overlooked aspects of building such models is feature encoding. This research paper explores the importance of feature encoding to improve the efficiency of threat detection and proposes a novel entropy-based encoding scheme for the categorical features present in the data extracted from malicious inputs. The KDDCUP99, UNSW-NB15 and CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 datasets have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encoding scheme. The results of the proposed encoding scheme are validated against seven other encoding schemes to ascertain the credibility and usability of the proposed scheme. The efficiency of the proposed system evaluated by applying different encoded versions of the datasets to train various machine learning models and determining the classification performance of the models on each dataset. The machine learning models trained with the proposed encoding scheme produced stable classification results and outperformed other encoding schemes when dimensionality reduction was applied on the data. The ensemble classifier trained using the proposed scheme was able to classify the data with an F1 score of 99.99% when the dimension-reduced entropy-encoded KDD Cup99 dataset was used to build the model. On the CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 dataset, the entropy encoding has exhibited a slightly improved classification parameters with the ensemble methods yielding a peak F1 score of 99.27%. We have also determined the feature importance values of the features present in the datasets to study the change in the contribution levels of the features when multiple categorical encoding schemes are applied upon the data.",2024,,0.0,102.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00400e2514bc0e41323ddf7beb1bec5ab2516b82

Currently, no specific clinical decision rules are available for OAT patients. The aim of the study was to identify which clinical risk factors easily identifiable at first ED evaluation may be associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in OAT patients who suffered an MTBI. Methods Three thousand fifty-four patients in OAT with MTBI from four Italian centers were retrospectively considered. A decision tree analysis using the classification and regression tree (CART) method was conducted to evaluate both the pre- and post-traumatic clinical risk factors most associated with the presence of post-traumatic ICH after MTBI and their possible role in determining the patient’s risk. The decision tree analysis used all clinical risk factors identified at the first ED evaluation as input predictor variables. Results ICH following MTBI was present in 9.5% of patients (290/3054). The CART model created a decision tree using 5 risk factors, post-traumatic amnesia, post-traumatic transitory loss of consciousness, greater trauma dynamic, GCS less than 15, evidence of trauma above the clavicles, capable of stratifying patients into different increasing levels of ICH risk (from 2.5 to 61.4%). The absence of concussion and neurological alteration at admission appears to significantly reduce the possible presence of ICH. Conclusions The machine-learning-based CART model identified distinct prognostic groups of patients with distinct outcomes according to on clinical risk factors. Decision trees can be useful as guidance in patient selection and risk stratification of patients in OAT with MTBI.",2022,2022-03-24,6.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0040c11db2f3787dd6eaba009ab989833cd491de

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074559,From Big Data to Deep Data to Support People Analytics for Employee Attrition Prediction,"In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking ‘big’ by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking ‘deep’ by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that ‘business travel’, which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.",2021,,48.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0040fbc24133d560c7de163f4bd7a32e07f9fd1e

This article, though, sheds some light on the actual differences that can be seen in how men and women drive. In this study, GPS-recorded driving dynamics data from 123 drivers, 48 women and 75 men, are analysed and drivers are categorised as aggressive, normal or gentle. A total of 10% of the drivers was categorised as aggressive, with an even distribution between the genders. For the gentle drivers, 11% of the drivers, the men dominated. The driving style investigation was extended to utilise machine learning, confirming the results from statistical tools. As driving style highly impacts a vehicle’s fuel consumption, while switching over to battery electric vehicles it is important to investigate how the different driving styles impact battery utilisation. Two Li-ion battery cell types were tested utilising the same load cycle with three levels of current amplitude, to represent accelerations for the three drive categories. While one cell type was insensitive to the current amplitude, the highly energy-optimised cell proved to be sensitive to higher current amplitudes, corresponding to a more aggressive driving style.

This study explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and citizen engagement in improving road safety for vulnerable populations (pedestrians, cyclists) in Genoa, Italy. Aligned with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the project aims for a 50% reduction in traffic accidents by 2030.The AI4PublicPolicy initiative introduces the Virtual Policy Management Environment (VPME) platform. VPME utilizes ML, Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and chatbots to empower the policy development lifecycle. Citizen feedback is integrated through workshops and surveys, fostering a citizen-centric approach. The Genoa pilot program demonstrates VPME's capabilities. ML models analyse historical accident and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to predict future high-risk areas. These predictions inform resource allocation and targeted interventions for pedestrian crossings and school walking routes (""Pedibus""). Dashboards visualize the model outputs, allowing users to assess risk levels and predict accident occurrences. Future improvements include incorporating additional data sources (demographics, real-time traffic) for enhanced model accuracy. Citizen engagement played a vital role. Co-creation workshops facilitated stakeholder participation in defining Use Cases, User Stories, and project objectives. Discussions focused on integrating data from environmental, traffic, and citizen reporting systems with VPME solutions. Participants evaluated the project approach and provided valuable feedback. The project highlights the potential of AI and citizen collaboration for data-driven policymaking. This approach empowers municipalities to make informed decisions that prioritize public safety and well-being.

A simple logistic regression model along with 3 forms of logistic regression models (ie, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Ridge, and Elastic Net) with regularization functions was trained on this data to compare classification performances in classifying patients who experienced diagnostic errors during hospitalization. Further, statistical tests were conducted to find significant differences between female and male patients who experienced diagnostic errors.


RESULTS
In total, 126 (7.4%) patients (of 1704) had been identified by case reviewers as having experienced at least 1 diagnostic error. Patients who had experienced diagnostic error were grouped by sex: 59 (7.1%) of the 830 women and 67 (7.7%) of the 874 men. Among the patients who experienced a diagnostic error, female patients were older (median 72, IQR 66-80 vs median 67, IQR 57-76; P=.02), had higher rates of being admitted through general or internal medicine (69.5% vs 47.8%; P=.01), lower rates of cardiovascular-related admitted diagnosis (11.9% vs 28.4%; P=.02), and lower rates of being admitted through neurology department (2.3% vs 13.4%; P=.04). The Ridge model achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.885), specificity (0.797), positive predictive value (PPV; 0.24), and F1-score (0.369) in classifying patients who were at higher risk of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing can be a potential solution to more effectively identifying and selecting potential diagnostic error cases for review and therefore reducing the case review burden.",2024,2024-08-26,1.0,27.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004442d02b543868c4c89d52ed038aff794f6108
10.17762/ijritcc.v11i5.6523,Remote Health Monitoring IoT Framework using Machine Learning Prediction and Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) Model,"Real intervention and treatment standards drew attention to remote health monitoring frameworks. Remote monitoring frameworks for disease detection at an early stage are opposed by most conventional works. Even so, it ran into issues like increased operational complexity, higher resource costs, inaccurate predictions, longer data collection times, and a lower convergence rate. A remote health monitoring framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict heart disease and diabetes from medical datasets is the goal of this project. Patients' health data is collected via smart devices, and the resulting data is then combined using a variety of nodes, including a detection node, a visualisation node, and a prognostic node. People with long-term illnesses (such as the elderly and disabled) are in such greater demand than ever before that a new approach to healthcare delivery is essential. In the evolved paradigm, conventional physical medical services foundations like clinics, nursing homes, and long haul care offices will be old. Due to recent advancements in modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the smart healthcare system has become increasingly necessary (ML). This paper will discuss wearable and smartphone technologies, AI for medical diagnostics, and assistive structures, including social robots, that have been created for the surrounding upheld living climate. The review presents programming reconciliation structures that are urgent for consolidating information examination and other man-made consciousness instruments to develop brilliant medical care frameworks (AI).",2023,2023-05-17,1.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00449468f147c5c0ac3345ffad4018bd36ec92c1

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT. Materials and Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I–II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors. Results Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794–0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873–0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789–0.915), respectively.

Although CaOx crystallization inhibitors have been suggested as a therapeutic modality already decades ago, limited progress has been made in the discovery of potent molecules with efficacy in animal disease models. Herein, an image‐based machine learning approach to systematically screen chemically modified myo‐inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) analogues is utilized, which enables the identification of a highly active divalent inositol phosphate molecule. To date, this is the first molecule shown to completely inhibit the crystallization process in the nanomolar range, reduce crystal–cell interactions, thereby preventing CaOx‐induced transcriptomic changes, and decrease renal CaOx deposition and kidney injury in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria.

10.3389/fneur.2023.1189076,Experimental verification and identifying biomarkers related to insomnia,"Introduction Insomnia is the most common form of sleep deprivation (SD) observed in clinics. Although there are differences between insomnia and SD, they have similar symptoms and the same animal model. Currently, there is a lack of microarray data on insomnia. Therefore, for now, we are going to apply the SD data to insomnia. Although many studies have explained the possible mechanisms associated with insomnia, no previous studies have considered the key genes associated with insomnia or the relationship between insomnia and immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between key genes and immune cells by identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of insomnia. Next, we verified the efficacy of these biomarkers experimentally. Methods First, we downloaded four microarrays (GSE11755, GSE12624, GSE28750, and GSE48080) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 239 normal human blood samples and 365 blood specimens from patients with SD. Then, we analyzed two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model to investigate these key genes. Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not. Discussion In summary, we identified a key gene (C2CD2L) that may facilitate the development of biomarkers for insomnia.",2023,2023-11-28,2.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00471583b7d751fc7043be63f18eaa4b25985bec

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011010,Combining phylogeny and coevolution improves the inference of interaction partners among paralogous proteins,"Predicting protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important goal of computational biology. Various sources of information can be used to this end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of sequences is modest. Author summary When two protein families interact, their sequences feature statistical dependencies. First, interacting proteins tend to share a common evolutionary history. Second, maintaining structure and interactions through the course of evolution yields coevolution, detectable via correlations in the amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",2022,2022-08-24,6.0,49.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0047d0cad12b452bb9d27d81105380f589085199
10.1063/5.0126358,Recent trends in marine microplastic modeling and machine learning tools: Potential for long-term microplastic monitoring,"The increase in the global demand for plastics, and more recently during the pandemic, is a major concern for the future of plastic waste pollution and microplastics. Efficient microplastic monitoring is imperative to understanding the long-term effects and progression of microplastic effects in the environment. Numerical models are valuable in studying microplastic transport as they can be used to examine the effects of different parameters systematically to help elucidate the fate and transport processes of microplastics, thus providing a holistic view of microplastics in the ocean environment. By incorporating physical parameters (such as size, shape, density, and identity of microplastics), numerical models have gained better understanding of the physics of microplastic transport, predicted sinking velocities more accurately, and estimated microplastic pathways in marine environments. However, availability of large amounts of information about microplastic physical and chemical parameters is sparse. Machine learning and computer-vision tools can aid in acquiring environmental information and provide input to develop more accurate models and verify their predictions. More accurate models can further the understanding of microplastic transport, facilitate monitoring efforts, and thus optimize where more data collection can take place to ultimately improve machine learning tools. This review offers a perspective on how image-based machine learning can be exploited to help uncover the physics of microplastic transport behaviors. Additionally, the authors hope the review inspires studies that can bridge the gap between numerical modeling and machine learning for microplastic analysis to exploit their joined potential.",2023,2023-01-14,23.0,58.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004803f2035c025936c33a5ef4445eba34a339ba

However, the inference and learning problems in the Boltzmann machine are NP-hard. The investigation of an effective learning algorithm for the Boltzmann machine is one of the most important challenges in the field of statistical machine learning. In this paper, we study Boltzmann machine learning based on the (first-order) spatial Monte Carlo integration method, referred to as the 1-SMCI learning method, which was proposed in the author’s previous paper. In the first part of this paper, we compare the method with the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation (MPLE) method using a theoretical and a numerical approaches, and show the 1-SMCI learning method is more effective than the MPLE.

As with any machine learning implementation, the challenge on the utilization of MLPNN in rainfall forecasting lies in the development and evaluation of MLPNN models which delivers optimal forecasting performance. This research conducted performance analysis of MLPNN models through data preparation, model designing, and model evaluation in order to determine which parameters are the best-fit configurations for MLPNN model implementation in rainfall forecasting. During rainfall data preparation, imputation process and spatial correlation evaluation of weather variables from various weather stations showed that the geographical location of the chosen weather stations did not have a direct correlation between stations with respect to rainfall behavior leading to the decision of utilizing the weather station having the most complete weather data to be fed in the MLPNN. By conducting performance analysis of MLPNN models with different combinations of training algorithms, activation functions, learning rate, and momentum, it was found out that MLPNN model having 100 hidden neurons with Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm and Sigmoid activation function delivered the lowest RMSE of 0.031537 while another MLPNN model having the same number of hidden neurons, the same activation function but Resilient Propagation as training algorithm had the lowest MAE of 0.0209.

Nevertheless, an imbalance amid the hospitalized people demands and the respiratory structure could cause to inconsistencies in the patient’s inhalation. To tackle this problem, this study presents an Iterative Learning PID Controller (ILC-PID), a unique current cycle feedback type controller that helps in gaining the correct pressure and volume. The paper also offers a clear and complete examination of the primarily efficient neural approach for generating optimal inhalation strategies. Moreover, machine learning-based classifiers are used to evaluate the precision and performance of the ILC-PID controller. These classifiers able to forecast and choose the perfect type for various inhalation modes, eliminating the likelihood that patients will require mechanical ventilation. In pressure control, the suggested accurate neural categorization exhibited an average accuracy rate of 88.2% in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode and 91.7% in proportional assist ventilation (PAV) mode while comparing with the other classifiers like ensemble classifier has reduced accuracy rate of 69.5% in CPAP mode and also 71.7% in PAV mode.

With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding. Methods The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit ≥ 18 years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features ( n  = 88) were selected with clinicians’ input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in > 0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. Results There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632–0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs.

The method for developing recommendations based on collaborative filtering such as Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and hybrid methods of Machine Learning (ML) has been improved. The paper describes the design principles and functional requirements to a recommendation system in the form of a Web application for choosing the content required by user using movies as an example. The research has focused on solving issues related to cold start and scalability within the method of collaborative filtering. To effectively address these tasks, we have used hybrid training methods. A hybrid recommendation system (HRS) has been practically implemented for providing relevant content recommendations using movies as an example, taking into consideration the user's personal preferences based on the constructed hybrid method. We have improved an algorithm for developing content recommendations based on the collaborative filtering and Machine Learning for the combined filtration of similarity indicators among users or goods. The hybrid algorithm receives initial information in a different form, normalizes it, and generates relevant recommendations based on a combination of CF and CBF methods. Machine Learning is capable of defining those factors that influence the selection of relevant films, which improves development of recommendations specific to the user. To solve these tasks, a new improved method has been proposed, underlying which, in contrast to existing systems of recommendations, are the hybrid methods and Machine Learning. Machine Learning data for the designed HRS were borrowed from MovieLens. We have analyzed methods for developing recommendations to the user; existing recommendation systems have been reviewed. Our experimental results demonstrate that the operational indicators for the proposed HRS, based on the technology of CF+CBF+ML, outperform those for two individual models, CF and CBF, and such their combinations as CF CBF, CF+ML, and CBF+ML.

10.3389/fphy.2023.1217275,Establishment and interpretation of the gamma pass rate prediction model based on radiomics for different intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques in the pelvis,"Backgroundand objectives: Implementation of patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) is a crucial aspect of precise radiotherapy. Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2 mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. The F1 scores and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.86, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.86, and 0.81, 0.77, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. The explanation of the model output based on SHAP values can provide a reference basis for medical physicists when adjusting the plan, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of treatment plans.Conclusion: It is feasible to use a machine learning method based on radiomics to establish a gamma pass rate classification prediction model for IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvis. The XGBoost model performs better in classification than the other three tree-based ensemble models, and global explanations and single-sample explanations of the model output through SHAP values may offer reference for medical physicists to provide high-quality plans, promoting the clinical application and implementation of GPR prediction models, and providing safe and efficient personalized QA management for patients.",2023,2023-08-10,1.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004abb09f8331e8f161049ca7578bbd3011e0f3c

Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. Methods The multi-institutional PHIS+ clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children’s hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Results Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity . Conclusions NLP-based pneumonia information extraction of pediatric diagnostic imaging reports performed better than domain experts in this pilot study. NLP is an efficient method to extract information from a large collection of imaging reports to facilitate CER.",2017,2017-05-01,17.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004b6bec13e8bb316746b9b768ff2df34e8f62b5

However, they have strong relations since a longer processing time triggers a change in schedule. Although promising approaches already exist for mapping the influence of manufacturing processes on production scheduling, the variability of the production environment, including changing process conditions, technological parameters and the status of current orders, is usually ignored. For this reason, this paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that adaptively refines the production schedule by applying Machine Learning (ML)-models during the manufacturing process in order to predict the process-dependent parameters that influence the schedule. With the proper prediction of these parameters based on the process conditions, the production schedule is proactively adjusted to changing conditions not only to ensure the sufficient product quality but also to reduce the negative effects and losses that delayed rescheduling would cause. The proposed approach aims on minimizing the overall lateness by utilizing an active data exchange between the scheduling system and the predictive ML-models on the process level. The efficiency of the solution is demonstrated by a realistic case study using discrete event simulation.",2019,2019-11-13,6.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004b6d70928e09cd0a0ce84fc49c270a4b754e41
10.7554/eLife.10047,Active machine learning-driven experimentation to determine compound effects on protein patterns,"High throughput screening determines the effects of many conditions on a given biological target. Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance.

10.1007/s10676-023-09734-6,Can machine learning make naturalism about health truly naturalistic? A reflection on a data-driven concept of health,"Through hypothetical scenarios, this paper analyses whether machine learning (ML) could resolve one of the main shortcomings present in Christopher Boorse’s Biostatistical Theory of health (BST). In doing so, it foregrounds the boundaries and challenges of employing ML in formulating a naturalist (i.e., prima facie value-free) definition of health. The paper argues that a sweeping dataist approach cannot fully make the BST truly naturalistic, as prior theories and values persist. It also points out that supervised learning introduces circularity, rendering it incompatible with a naturalistic perspective. Additionally, it underscores the need for pre-existing auxiliary theories to assess results from unsupervised learning. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the epistemological entanglements between data and data processing methods to manage expectations about what data patterns can predict. In conclusion, the paper argues against delegating the final authority for defining complex concepts like health to AI systems, as it necessitates ethical judgment and capacities for deliberation that AI currently lacks. It also warns against granting creators and deployers of AI systems the discretionary authority to determine these definitions outside the wider social discussion, advocating for ongoing public engagement on normative notions. Failure to do so risks limiting individuals and collectives’ ability to shape a just digital future and diminishes their fundamental epistemic agency.",2023,2023-12-12,1.0,35.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004bbd2f00372355c5b4bf4085025c9c64de1ad2

Understanding how this pathogen may be adapted to persist along the farm-to-table supply chain has applications for addressing food safety. This study utilized machine learning to develop robust models classifying genomic diversity of V. parahaemolyticus that was isolated from environmental (n = 176), seafood (n = 975), and clinical (n = 865) sample origins. We constructed a pangenome of the respective genome assemblies and employed random forest algorithm to develop predictive models to identify gene clusters encoding metabolism, virulence, and antibiotic resistance that were associated with isolate source type. Comparison of genomes of all seafood-clinical isolates showed high balanced accuracy (≥0.80) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (≥0.87) for all of these functional features. Major virulence factors including tdh, trh, type III secretion system-related genes, and four alpha-hemolysin genes (hlyA, hlyB, hlyC, and hlyD) were identified as important differentiating factors in our seafood-clinical virulence model, underscoring the need for further investigation. Significant patterns for AMR genes differing among seafood and clinical samples were revealed from our model and genes conferring to tetracycline, elfamycin, and multidrug (phenicol antibiotic, diaminopyrimidine antibiotic, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic) resistance were identified as the top three key variables.

We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), and high (0.5 < z < 1.0). By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for ∼60%–70% of the host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of ∼80%–95%, depending on the redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve a disk precision of 96%/82%/79% and bulge precision of 90%/90%/80% (for the three redshift bins) at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of 30%/43%/42%. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging surveys.",2022,2022-12-20,3.0,76.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c9375fc25383cc6c0e47e28b2eba73002696d
10.3390/en15113895,Projecting the Thermal Response in a HTGR-Type System during Conduction Cooldown Using Graph-Laplacian Based Machine Learning,"Accurate prediction of an off-normal event in a nuclear reactor is dependent upon the availability of sensory data, reactor core physical condition, and understanding of the underlying phenomenon. This work presents a method to project the data from some discrete sensory locations to the overall reactor domain during conduction cooldown scenarios similar to High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). The existing models for conductive cooldown in a heterogeneous multi-body system, such as an assembly of prismatic blocks or pebble beds relies on knowledge of the thermal contact conductance, requiring significant knowledge of local thermal contacts and heat transport possibilities across those contacts. With a priori knowledge of bulk geometry features and some discrete sensors, a machine learning approach was devised. The presented work uses an experimental facility to mimic conduction cooldown with an assembly of 68 cylindrical rods initially heated to 1200 K. High-fidelity temperature data were collected using an infrared (IR) camera to provide training data to the model and validate the predicted temperature data. The machine learning approach used here first converts the macroscopic bulk geometry information into Graph-Laplacian, and then uses the eigenvectors of the Graph-Laplacian to develop Kernel functions. Support vector regression (SVR) was implemented on the obtained Kernels and used to predict the thermal response in a packed rod assembly during a conduction cooldown experiment. The usage of SVR modeling differs from most models today because of its representation of thermal coupling between rods in the core. When trained with thermographic data, the average normalized error is less than 2% over 400 s, during which temperatures of the assembly have dropped by more than 500 K. The rod temperature prediction performance was significantly better for rods in the interior of the assembly compared to those near the exterior, likely due to the model simplification of the surroundings.",2022,2022-05-25,1.0,9.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c9f94e112605e0cae7497d8a31e2d44ee0c10

10.12720/jait.16.3.396-410,Robust Approach to Improve Link Prediction Accuracy in Directed Social Networks Based on Ensemble Learning Models and Advanced Feature Extraction Techniques,"—Link prediction is a significant field in network science, which focuses on predicting the probability of the existence or formation of a link between nodes in a social network based on currently observed connections. Recently, several efficient link prediction algorithms have been developed, demonstrating robust results in both prediction accuracy and interpretability. However, existing research has not clearly established the relationship between network characteristics and link creation mechanisms. The ability to predict complex networks with diverse features still requires further investigation. In light of this, we introduce a novel framework designed to combine the best features of different link prediction algorithms when applied to the network, with the aim of achieving more reliable predictions about how networks will evolve in consequence. According to the proposed framework, this first focuses on the feature extraction stage. During this phase, we systematically identify and extract a comprehensive set of features from the network before moving on to the classification phase. Here, we utilize state-of-the-art ensemble learning models to assess and classify potential links within the network. By training our Machine Learning (ML) models on the extracted features, we can effectively predict whether a particular link is likely to form (positive link) or unlikely to form (negative link). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: Twitch and Facebook. Additionally, we assessed their performance on these datasets by conducting specific preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning steps.

10.1017/S1751731120000312,Review: Synergy between mechanistic modelling and data-driven models for modern animal production systems in the era of big data.,"Mechanistic models (MMs) have served as causal pathway analysis and 'decision-support' tools within animal production systems for decades. Such models quantitatively define how a biological system works based on causal relationships and use that cumulative biological knowledge to generate predictions and recommendations (in practice) and generate/evaluate hypotheses (in research). Their limitations revolve around obtaining sufficiently accurate inputs, user training and accuracy/precision of predictions on-farm. The new wave in digitalization technologies may negate some of these challenges. New data-driven (DD) modelling methods such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) examine patterns in data to produce accurate predictions (forecasting, classification of animals, etc.). The deluge of sensor data and new self-learning modelling techniques may address some of the limitations of traditional MM approaches - access to input data (e.g. sensors) and on-farm calibration. However, most of these new methods lack transparency in the reasoning behind predictions, in contrast to MM that have historically been used to translate knowledge into wisdom. The objective of this paper is to propose means to hybridize these two seemingly divergent methodologies to advance the models we use in animal production systems and support movement towards truly knowledge-based precision agriculture. In order to identify potential niches for models in animal production of the future, a cross-species (dairy, swine and poultry) examination of the current state of the art in MM and new DD methodologies (ML, DL analytics) is undertaken. We hypothesize that there are several ways via which synergy may be achieved to advance both our predictive capabilities and system understanding, being: (1) building and utilizing data streams (e.g. intake, rumination behaviour, rumen sensors, activity sensors, environmental sensors, cameras and near IR) to apply MM in real-time and/or with new resolution and capabilities; (2) hybridization of MM and DD approaches where, for example, a ML framework is augmented by MM-generated parameters or predicted outcomes and (3) hybridization of the MM and DD approaches, where biological bounds are placed on parameters within a MM framework, and the DD system parameterizes the MM for individual animals, farms or other such clusters of data. As animal systems modellers, we should expand our toolbox to explore new DD approaches and big data to find opportunities to increase understanding of biological systems, find new patterns in data and move the field towards intelligent, knowledge-based precision agriculture systems.",2020,2020-03-06,38.0,58.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004e1e48c8b5bf4d159d683d722604ee0ba37be1

In this work, we developed simulation models for different EV charging scenarios in the home sector. We used them to predict maximum demand based on the increasing penetration of EV consumers. We comprehensively reviewed the literature on EV charging technologies, battery capacity, charging situations, and the impact of EV loads. Our results suggest a method for visualizing the impact of EV charging loads by considering factors such as state of charge, arrival time, charging duration, rate of charge, maximum charging power, and involvement rate. This method can be used to model load profiles and determine the number of chargers needed to meet EV user demand. We also explored the use of a time-of-use (TOU) tariff as a demand response strategy, which encourages EV owners to charge their vehicles off-peak in order to avoid higher demand charges. Our simulation results show the effects of various charging conditions on load profiles and indicate that the current TOU price strategy can accommodate a 20% growth in EV consumers, while the alternative TOU price strategy can handle up to a 30% penetration level.",2023,2023-04-20 00:00:00,13.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9357a46f47c6f2bea9761cbcd79ddab4e350d557
10.3390/app13063760,Data-Driven Model for Identifying Factors Influencing Electric Vehicle Charging Demand: A Comparative Analysis of Early- and Maturity-Phases of Electric Vehicle Programs in Korea,"With increasing concerns about urban pollution, electric vehicles (EVs) have offered an alternative mode of transportation that reduces urban pollution levels. Previous studies have sought to identify the various factors influencing EV charging patterns to deploy an appropriate charging infrastructure. However, limited attention has been paid to the investigation of different charging patterns identified in different regions at different phases of the EV program. This study aims to fill this research gap in the literature by developing binary logistic models that account for the factors influencing charging demands in different regions of Korea, i.e., Jeju-do and Gangneung-si. To this end, we collected historical data on EV charging transactions in these study regions and analyzed them to evaluate the difference in charging demands. The developed models suggest that the charging demand varies with charger characteristics and charging time. Moreover, different charging patterns in different regions can be explained by the different travel behaviors of those who use EVs for different trip purposes. These findings provide an important implication suggesting that policymakers should consider a stepwise strategy to construct charging infrastructure at the appropriate scale and configuration, depending on the phase of the EV program.",2023,2023-03-15 00:00:00,6.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c59c06c8a44acbda74667e76459b2df8dae90273

This study identifies user behavioral patterns by analyzing data from more than 7000 charging stations in Canada, comparing residential vs. public Level 2, and public direct current fast (DCFC) vs. public Level 2 charging. A novel algorithm, CHAODA, was applied to identify differences between DCFC and other Level 2 charging options. Through a multivariate and holistic methodology, various patterns emerge, identifying differences in the utilization and seasonality of different EVSE types. The study provides evidence of an “EV Duck Curve” that amplifies the baseline of the power production “Duck Curve,” confirming future challenges for grid stability. Implementations of this study can support future EVSE infrastructure planning efforts and help improve the overall service of electric vehicle supply equipment and grid stability.",2023,2023-02-05 00:00:00,36.0,49.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49e3c326f67a5916bdb617f9399b21c16f9803ad
10.3390/wevj12030094,Improved Prediction of Total Energy Consumption and Feature Analysis in Electric Vehicles Using Machine Learning and Shapley Additive Explanations Method,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as the green energy alternative for conventional vehicles. While various governments promote EVs, people feel “range anxiety” because of their limited driving range or charge capacity. A limited number of charging stations are available, which results in a strong demand for predicting energy consumed by EVs. In this paper, machine learning (ML) models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to investigate the total energy consumption (TEC) by the EVs. The independent variables used for the study include changing real-life situations or external parameters, such as trip distance, tire type, driving style, power, odometer reading, EV model, city, motorway, country roads, air conditioning, and park heating. We compared the ML models’ performance along with the error analysis. A pairwise correlation study showed that trip distance has a high correlation coefficient (0.87) with TEC. XGBoost had better prediction accuracy (~92%) or R2 (0.92). Trip distance, power, heating, and odometer reading were the most important features influencing the TEC, identified using the shapley additive explanations method.",2021,2021-06-29 00:00:00,28.0,24.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bf43099563822c04eb58e6ac7c745680eafcbe7
10.3390/en13164231,Data-Driven Charging Demand Prediction at Public Charging Stations Using Supervised Machine Learning Regression Methods,"Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) user charging behavior has a significant influence on a distribution network and its reliability. Generally, monitoring energy consumption has become one of the most important factors in green and micro grids; therefore, predicting the charging demand of PEVs (the energy consumed during the charging session) could help to efficiently manage the electric grid. Consequently, three machine learning methods are applied in this research to predict the charging demand for the PEV user after a charging session starts. This approach is validated using a dataset consisting of seven years of charging events collected from public charging stations in the state of Nebraska, USA. The results show that the regression method, XGBoost, slightly outperforms the other methods in predicting the charging demand, with an RMSE equal to 6.68 kWh and R2 equal to 51.9%. The relative importance of input variables is also discussed, showing that the user’s historical average demand has the most predictive value. Accurate prediction of session charging demand, as opposed to the daily or hourly demand of multiple users, has many possible applications for utility companies and charging networks, including scheduling, grid stability, and smart grid integration.",2020,2020-08-16 00:00:00,123.0,64.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1024399fd57e9c554058503f1ae1742eced5864f
10.3390/en13102571,Assessment and Mitigation of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Impact to Transformer Aging for an Apartment Complex,"Due to the increasing use of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the effect of the EV charging power demand on the reliability of the power system infrastructure needs to be addressed. In apartment complexes, which have emerged as a common residential type in metropolitan areas and highly populated districts, high charging demand could result in substantial stress to distribution networks. In this work, the effect of EV charging power demand in an apartment complex on the aging of the Distribution Transformer (DT) is studied. A methodology based on the stochastic characterization of vehicle usage profiles and user charging patterns is developed to obtain realistic EV charging demand profiles. Based on the modeled EV charging profile and the transformer thermal model, the effect of different EV penetration ratios on DT aging for an apartment complex in the Republic of Korea is studied. Results for an EV penetration ratio of up to 30% indicated that DT aging could be accelerated by up to 40%, compared to the case without EV charging. To mitigate this accelerated DT aging caused by EV charging, the effectiveness of two integration approaches of Photovoltaic (PV) sources was studied. Based on a case study that included a realistic PV generation profile, it was demonstrated that a significant contribution to DT reliability could be achieved via the operation of PV sources. A more apparent contribution of PV integration was observed with an energy storage installation at higher EV penetration ratios. At an EV penetration ratio of 30%, a maximum decrease of 41.8% in the loss-of-life probability of the DT was achieved. The effects of different PV integration approaches and power management details on DT aging were also studied. The results demonstrate that the EV charging demand could introduce a significant level of stress to DTs and that this impact can be effectively mitigated by installing PV sources. These observations are expected to contribute toward the effective planning of power system infrastructures that support the design of sustainable cities with the widespread use of EVs.",2020,2020-05-19 00:00:00,7.0,67.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f47b94e2cd35c26ac2856e31a7445159a92e9ef0

One of the most challenging problems in cloud computing is detecting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The attack detection framework for the DDoS attack is tricky because of its nonlinear nature of interruption activities, atypical system traffic behaviour, and many features in the problem space. As a result, creating defensive solutions against these attacks is critical for mainstream cloud computing adoption. In this novel research, by using performance parameters, perplexed-based classifiers with and without feature selection will be compared with the existing machine learning algorithms such as naïve Bayes and random forest to prove the efficacy of the perplexed-based classification algorithm. Comparing the performance parameters like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, the proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 99%, which is higher than the existing algorithms, proving that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in detecting the DDoS attacks in cloud computing systems. To extend our research in the area of nature-inspired computing, we compared our perplexed Bayes classifier feature selection with nature-inspired feature selection like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and found that our classifier is highly efficient in comparison with GA and PSO and their accuracies are 2% and 8%, respectively, less than those of perplexed Bayes classifier.",2022,2022-07-19 00:00:00,17.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f6bf33877df1d13c16b2bbe045411f426a2cd3a

We introduce an uncertainty‐controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA) based on ensemble machine learning predictions from different molecular representations that concurrently optimizes excited state energies, synthesizability, and exciton size for the discovery of singlet fission materials. The ucGA allows us to efficiently explore the chemical space spanned by the reFORMED fragment database, which consists of 45,000 cores and 5,000 substituents derived from crystallographic structures assembled in the FORMED repository. Running the ucGA in an exploitative setup performs local optimization on variations of known singlet fission scaffolds, such as acenes. In an explorative mode, hitherto unknown candidates displaying excellent excited state properties for singlet fission are generated. We suggest a class of heteroatom‐rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge‐transfer mediated singlet fission. When included in larger donor‐acceptor systems, these units exhibit localization of the triplet state, favorable diradicaloid character and suitable triplet energies for exciton injection into semiconductor solar cells.",2024,2024-09-25 00:00:00,1.0,9.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4880ef516028dd598fe9339429b36658530fd3c2

An open challenge in this area is designing linkers between disconnected molecular fragments of interest to obtain chemically relevant candidate drug molecules. In this work, we propose DiffLinker, an E(3)-equivariant three-dimensional conditional diffusion model for molecular linker design. Given a set of disconnected fragments, our model places missing atoms in between and designs a molecule incorporating all the initial fragments. Unlike previous approaches that are only able to connect pairs of molecular fragments, our method can link an arbitrary number of fragments. Additionally, the model automatically determines the number of atoms in the linker and its attachment points to the input fragments.

GaUDI shows improved conditional design, generating molecules with optimal properties and even going beyond the original distribution to suggest better molecules than those in the dataset.

Solution measurements provided singlet and triplet excitation energies and fluorescence yields and lifetimes; conformational properties were analyzed computationally. The molecular properties are close to ideal for singlet fission. However, crystal structures, obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), are rather similar to those of the polymorphs of solid 1, in which the formation of a charge-separated state followed by intersystem crossing, complemented with excimer formation, outcompetes singlet fission. Results of calculations by the approximate SIMPLE method suggest which ones among the solid derivatives are the best candidates for singlet fission, but it appears difficult to change the crystal packing in a desirable direction. We also describe the preparation of three specifically deuteriated versions of 1, expected to help sort out the mechanism of fast intersystem crossing in its charge-separated state.",2023,2023-05-23 00:00:00,2.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c69a97bf89ee92f772077f85e21f5270d4067ec
10.1038/s41467-023-44629-6,Diffusion-based generative AI for exploring transition states from 2D molecular graphs,"The exploration of transition state (TS) geometries is crucial for elucidating chemical reaction mechanisms and modeling their kinetics. Recently, machine learning (ML) models have shown remarkable performance for prediction of TS geometries. However, they require 3D conformations of reactants and products often with their appropriate orientations as input, which demands substantial efforts and computational cost. Here, we propose a generative approach based on the stochastic diffusion method, namely TSDiff, for prediction of TS geometries just from 2D molecular graphs. TSDiff outperforms the existing ML models with 3D geometries in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it enables to sample various TS conformations, because it learns the distribution of TS geometries for diverse reactions in training. Thus, TSDiff finds more favorable reaction pathways with lower barrier heights than those in the reference database. These results demonstrate that TSDiff shows promising potential for an efficient and reliable TS exploration. The exploration of transition state (TS) geometries is crucial for elucidating chemical reaction mechanisms and modelling their kinetics. Here, authors propose a generative AI approach to predict TS geometries just from 2D molecular graphs of a reaction.",2023,2023-04-20 00:00:00,20.0,87.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d367738e5ae6056b069ea512f79ff8bacb00d26
10.26599/bdma.2020.9020003,Applying big data based deep learning system to intrusion detection,"With vast amounts of data being generated daily and the ever increasing interconnectivity of the world's internet infrastructures, a machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has become a vital component to protect our economic and national security. Previous shallow learning and deep learning strategies adopt the single learning model approach for intrusion detection. The single learning model approach may experience problems to understand increasingly complicated data distribution of intrusion patterns. Particularly, the single deep learning model may not be effective to capture unique patterns from intrusive attacks having a small number of samples. In order to further enhance the performance of machine learning based IDS, we propose the Big Data based Hierarchical Deep Learning System (BDHDLS). BDHDLS utilizes behavioral features and content features to understand both network traffic characteristics and information stored in the payload. Each deep learning model in the BDHDLS concentrates its efforts to learn the unique data distribution in one cluster. This strategy can increase the detection rate of intrusive attacks as compared to the previous single learning model approaches. Based on parallel training strategy and big data techniques, the model construction time of BDHDLS is reduced substantially when multiple machines are deployed.",2020,2020-07-16 00:00:00,103.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c4cb10c6d40b8f1d570944269a0a2e680dd5eb6
10.1186/s13635-019-0084-4,Transfer learning for detecting unknown network attacks,"Network attacks are serious concerns in today’s increasingly interconnected society. Recent studies have applied conventional machine learning to network attack detection by learning the patterns of the network behaviors and training a classification model. These models usually require large labeled datasets; however, the rapid pace and unpredictability of cyber attacks make this labeling impossible in real time. To address these problems, we proposed utilizing transfer learning for detecting new and unseen attacks by transferring the knowledge of the known attacks. In our previous work, we have proposed a transfer learning-enabled framework and approach, called HeTL, which can find the common latent subspace of two different attacks and learn an optimized representation, which was invariant to attack behaviors’ changes. However, HeTL relied on manual pre-settings of hyper-parameters such as relativeness between the source and target attacks. In this paper, we extended this study by proposing a clustering-enhanced transfer learning approach, called CeHTL, which can automatically find the relation between the new attack and known attack. We evaluated these approaches by stimulating scenarios where the testing dataset contains different attack types or subtypes from the training set. We chose several conventional classification models such as decision trees, random forests, KNN, and other novel transfer learning approaches as strong baselines. Results showed that proposed HeTL and CeHTL improved the performance remarkably. CeHTL performed best, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in detecting new network attacks.",2019,2019-02-21 00:00:00,98.0,31.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/107031601bb3f139fc2bf0f55d2773b9a91cb56e

In this paper, we explore how to model an intrusion detection system based on deep learning, and we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS). Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the performance of the proposed model. We compare it with those of J48, artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and other machine learning methods proposed by previous researchers on the benchmark data set. The experimental results show that RNN-IDS is very suitable for modeling a classification model with high accuracy and that its performance is superior to that of traditional machine learning classification methods in both binary and multiclass classification.

10.1038/s41598-022-11173-0,Four-layer ConvNet to facial emotion recognition with minimal epochs and the significance of data diversity,"Emotion recognition is defined as identifying human emotion and is directly related to different fields such as human–computer interfaces, human emotional processing, irrational analysis, medical diagnostics, data-driven animation, human–robot communication, and many more. This paper proposes a new facial emotional recognition model using a convolutional neural network. Our proposed model, “ConvNet”, detects seven specific emotions from image data including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise. The features extracted by the Local Binary Pattern (LBP), region based Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) and Convolutional Neural network (CNN) from facial expressions images were fused to develop the classification model through training by our proposed CNN model (ConvNet). Our method can converge quickly and achieves good performance which the authors can develop a real-time schema that can easily fit the model and sense emotions. Furthermore, this study focuses on the mental or emotional stuff of a man or woman using the behavioral aspects. To complete the training of the CNN network model, we use the FER2013 databases at first, and then apply the generalization techniques to the JAFFE and CK+ datasets respectively in the testing stage to evaluate the performance of the model. In the generalization approach on the JAFFE dataset, we get a 92.05% accuracy, while on the CK+ dataset, we acquire a 98.13% accuracy which achieve the best performance among existing methods. We also test the system’s success by identifying facial expressions in real-time. ConvNet consists of four layers of convolution together with two fully connected layers. The experimental results show that the ConvNet is able to achieve 96% training accuracy which is much better than current existing models. However, when compared to other validation methods, the suggested technique was more accurate. ConvNet also achieved validation accuracy of 91.01% for the FER2013 dataset.

However, students often get distracted because of various reasons, which affect their learning capacity to a great extent. Many researchers have been trying to improve the quality of online education, but we need a holistic approach to address this issue. This paper intends to provide a mechanism that uses the camera feed and microphone input to monitor the real-time attention level of students during online classes. We explore various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms throughout this study. We propose a system that uses five distinct non-verbal features to calculate the attention score of the student during computer-based tasks and generate real-time feedback for both students and the organization.

The existing student behavior recognition methods mainly focus on the behavior of the single student and have low performance and efficiency. To recognize the behaviors of multiple students in the classroom at the same time, we propose a fast and effective solution, called ET-YOLOv5s, which is an improved YOLOv5s with ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) and a tiny object detection module in this paper. First, the ESRGAN is adopted to generate high-definition images from original images of real classroom environments in colleges to improve the recognition accuracy. Then a tiny object detection module is added to the YOLOv5s to detect the smaller objects on high-definition images, such as phones, books, and students sitting at the back of the classroom. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed solution can detect 11 kinds of students’ behaviors in classrooms, including playing mobile phones, having class, sitting with hands on face, sitting turn right, sitting turn left, bowing, sleeping, and so on.

10.1145/3610219,Understanding the Role of Human Intuition on Reliance in Human-AI Decision-Making with Explanations,"AI explanations are often mentioned as a way to improve human-AI decision-making, but empirical studies have not found consistent evidence of explanations' effectiveness and, on the contrary, suggest that they can increase overreliance when the AI system is wrong. While many factors may affect reliance on AI support, one important factor is how decision-makers reconcile their own intuition---beliefs or heuristics, based on prior knowledge, experience, or pattern recognition, used to make judgments---with the information provided by the AI system to determine when to override AI predictions. We conduct a think-aloud, mixed-methods study with two explanation types (feature- and example-based) for two prediction tasks to explore how decision-makers' intuition affects their use of AI predictions and explanations, and ultimately their choice of when to rely on AI. Our results identify three types of intuition involved in reasoning about AI predictions and explanations: intuition about the task outcome, features, and AI limitations. Building on these, we summarize three observed pathways for decision-makers to apply their own intuition and override AI predictions. We use these pathways to explain why (1) the feature-based explanations we used did not improve participants' decision outcomes and increased their overreliance on AI, and (2) the example-based explanations we used improved decision-makers' performance over feature-based explanations and helped achieve complementary human-AI performance. Overall, our work identifies directions for further development of AI decision-support systems and explanation methods that help decision-makers effectively apply their intuition to achieve appropriate reliance on AI.",2023,2023-01-18 00:00:00,83.0,95.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e632d642dc115a7f4cb7d881481ed61e70200af8

10.1021/acsomega.2c06471,The Effect of Machine Learning Algorithms on the Prediction of Layer-by-Layer Coating Properties,"Layer-by-layer film (LbL) coatings made of polyelectrolytes are a powerful tool for surface modification, including the applications in the biomedical field, for food packaging, and in many electrochemical systems. However, despite the number of publications related to LbL assembly, predicting LbL coating properties represents quite a challenge, can take a long time, and be very costly. Machine learning (ML) methodologies that are now emerging can accelerate and improve new coating development and potentially revolutionize the field. Recently, we have demonstrated a preliminary ML-based model for coating thickness prediction. In this paper, we compared several ML algorithms for optimizing a methodology for coating thickness prediction, namely, linear regression, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Extra Tree Regressor. The current research has shown that learning algorithms are effective in predicting the coating output value, with the Extra Tree Regressor algorithm demonstrating superior predictive performance, when used in combination with optimized hyperparameters and with missing data imputation. The best predictors of the coating thickness were determined, and they can be later used to accurately predict coating thickness, avoiding measurement of multiple parameters. The development of optimized methodologies will ensure different reliable predictive models for coating property/function relations. As a continuation, the methodology can be adapted and used for predicting the outputs connected to antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties in order to be able to respond to actual biomedical problems such as antibiotic resistance, implant rejection, or COVID-19 outbreak.",2023,2023-01-29 00:00:00,10.0,26.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc4b936a32a89133c58b9e29d3bce6fac19d8ed8

In this context, new implant materials and coatings that deal with medical device-associated complications are required. Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory materials are also required for wound healing applications, especially in diabetic patients with chronic wounds. In this work, we present hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels with triple activity: antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and miRNA delivery agent. We demonstrate that polyarginine with a degree of polymerization of 30 (PAR30), which was previously shown to have a prolonged antibacterial activity, decreases inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated macrophages. In addition, PAR30 accelerated fibroblast migration in macrophage/fibroblast co-culture system, suggesting a positive effect on wound healing. Furthermore, PAR30 allowed to load miRNA into HA hydrogels, and then to deliver them into the cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first describing miRNA-loaded hydrogels with antibacterial effect and anti-inflammatory features. Such system can become a tool for the treatment of infected wounds, e.g. diabetic ulcers, as well as for foreign body response modulation. This article is protected by copyright.

10.1038/s41598-021-98170-x,Prediction of coating thickness for polyelectrolyte multilayers via machine learning,"Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition method of polyelectrolytes is a versatile way of developing functional nanoscale coatings. Even though the mechanisms of LbL film development are well-established, currently there are no predictive models that can link film components with their final properties. The current health crisis has shown the importance of accelerated development of biomedical solutions such as antiviral coatings, and the implementation of machine learning methodologies for coating development can enable achieving this. In this work, using literature data and newly generated experimental results, we first analyzed the relative impact of 23 coating parameters on the coating thickness. Next, a predictive model has been developed using aforementioned parameters and molecular descriptors of polymers from the DeepChem library. Model performance was limited because of insufficient number of data points in the training set, due to the scarce availability of data in the literature. Despite this limitation, we demonstrate, for the first time, utilization of machine learning for prediction of LbL coating properties. It can decrease the time necessary to obtain functional coating with desired properties, as well as decrease experimental costs and enable the fast first response to crisis situations (such as pandemics) where coatings can positively contribute. Besides coating thickness, which was selected as an output value in this study, machine learning approach can be potentially used to predict functional properties of multilayer coatings, e.g. biocompatibility, cell adhesive, antibacterial, antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties.",2021,2021-09-21 00:00:00,9.0,42.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9f2075f6d057a26080dbd9c4047293b5ee95e01
10.1186/s40824-021-00228-4,The effects of the molecular weights of hyaluronic acid on the immune responses,"The molecular weight of hyaluronic acid (HyA) depends on the type of organ in the body. When HyA of the desired molecular weight is implanted into the human body for regeneration of damaged tissue, it is degraded by hyaluronidase in associated with an inflammatory response. This study sought to evaluate the effects of HyA molecular weight and concentration on pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in murine macrophages. The structures and molecular weights of HyAs (LMW-10, MMW-100, MMW-500, and HMW-1,500) were confirmed by 1 H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), respectively. After treatment of murine macrophages with a low (10 µg/mL) or high (100 µg/mL) concentration of each molecular weight HyA, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and changes in immune response in both LPS-stimulated and untreated macrophages were evaluated by assessing nitric oxide (NO) production, and analyzing expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes including by RT-PCR. Molecular weights of LMW-10, MMW-100, MMW-500, and HMW-1,500 were 13,241 ± 161, 96,531 ± 1,167, 512,657 ± 8,545, and 1,249,500 ± 37,477 Da, respectively. NO production by LPS-stimulated macrophages was decreased by increasing concentrations and molecular weights of HyA. At a high concentration of 100 µg/mL, HMW-1,500 reduced NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages to about 45 %. Using NanoString technology, we also found that the immune-related genes TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-11, CCL2, and Arg1 were specifically over-expressed in LPS-stimulated macrophages treated with various molecular weights of HyA. An RT-PCR analysis of gene expression showed that HMW-1,500 decreased expression of classically activated (M1) macrophage genes, such as TNF‐α, IL-6, CCL2, and IL-1β, in LPS-stimulated macrophages, whereas medium molecular-weight HyA (MMW-100 and MMW-500) instead increased expression levels of these genes. HMW-1,500 at a high concentration (100 µg/mL) significantly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Expression of genes associated with anti-inflammatory responses (M2 phenotype), such as TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-11, and Arg1, were increased by high concentrations of MMW-500 and HMW-1,500 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. High molecular-weight HyA (i.e., > 1,250 kDa) inhibits pro-inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages and induces anti-inflammatory responses in a concentration dependent manner.",2021,2021-06-28 00:00:00,84.0,60.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ac7d3a5579ef4c815d74cad688ece2c9433c595

However, despite its promises, their adoption in educational institutions is slow. There are many barriers to the adoption of OER, and many are from within the community of OER advocates. This commentary calls for a wider discussion to remove these barriers to mainstreaming OER in teaching and learning and argues for a rethinking of the idea of ‘open’ to make it more inclusive by redefining the concept. It reminds us of the original thinking behind OER – which was to create universally available educational resources that can improve the quality of teaching and learning. This commentary posits arguments against conflating OER and open education, questions the narrow definitions of OER, and raises issues around how to be more flexible and open to mainstreaming OER and removing barriers from within the OER movement.",2017,2017-08-24 00:00:00,112.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c6bf2dd4ba1d0a5a98be5cfdf5ababe60cd0d47

The study aims to clarify the macrophage heterogeneity and phenotype dynamics, and pinpoint critical targets within efferocytosis in DKD. Methods Utilizing early human DKD sequencing data, we computed the potential communication between leukocytes and renal intrinsic cells. Subsequently, we scrutinized the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from CD45-enriched immune cells, concentrating on the macrophage subsets in DKD. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was conducted to explore cell development. Differential expression genes (DEGs) from macrophage subgroups and bulk RNA-sequencing were used to identify shared hub genes. The NephroseqV5 platform was employed to evaluate the clinical significance, and the expression of key molecules was validated in DKD tissues. Results Macrophage infiltration rose in DKD, causing inflammation through the release of chemokines. As time progressed, the number of resident macrophages substantially dropped, with diminishing M1-like and increasing M2-like phenotypes relative to early stages. Further analysis pointed to the most enrichment of macrophage function is the phagosome. We overlapped the DEGs with efferocytosis-related genes and identified key genes, including CD36, ITGAM, and CX3CR1, which exhibited significant correlations with macrophages and T cells. The Nephroseq database revealed that they are associated with proteinuria and renal function. Consistent with the validation set, in vivo experiments verified elevated expression levels of key molecules. Conclusions In essence, our research elucidated the dynamics in macrophage subtype transitions. It emphasized three pivotal genes as critical modulators of macrophage efferocytosis in DKD, indicating their potential as innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",2025,2025-02-19 00:00:00,1.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61e5330e744545c8b4c92f51c818223acaa277df

10.3390/ijms25115704,Identification of 3-Aryl-1-benzotriazole-1-yl-acrylonitrile as a Microtubule-Targeting Agent (MTA) in Solid Tumors,"Recently, a compound derived from recent scientific advances named 34 has emerged as the focus of this research, the aim of which is to explore its potential impact on solid tumor cell lines. Using a combination of bioinformatics and biological assays, this study conducted an in-depth investigation of the effects of 34. The results of this study have substantial implications for cancer research and treatment. 34 has shown remarkable efficacy in inhibiting the growth of several cancer cell lines, including those representing prostate carcinoma (PC3) and cervical carcinoma (HeLa). The high sensitivity of these cells, indicated by low IC50 values, underscores its potential as a promising chemotherapeutic agent. In addition, 34 has revealed the ability to induce cell cycle arrest, particularly in the G2/M phase, a phenomenon with critical implications for tumor initiation and growth. By interfering with DNA replication in cancer cells, 34 has shown the capacity to trigger cell death, offering a new avenue for cancer treatment. In addition, computational analyses have identified key genes affected by 34 treatment, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. These genes are involved in critical biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication and microtubule dynamics, all of which are central to cancer development and progression. In conclusion, this study highlights the different mechanisms of 34 that inhibit cancer cell growth and alter the cell cycle. These promising results suggest the potential for more effective and less toxic anticancer therapies.

10.1038/s41598-024-58982-z,Tubulin alpha-1b chain was identified as a prognosis and immune biomarker in pan-cancer combing with experimental validation in breast cancer,"The α-tubulin subtype, Tubulin α-1b chain (TUBA1B), has been shown to influence immune cell infiltration, cancer growth, and survival across various malignancies. However, a comprehensive study has not yet been undertaken examining the immunological and predictive effects of TUBA1B in a pan-carcinoma context. Using data from TCGA, GEO, and other databases, we analyzed TUBA1B expression across various carcinoma types using transcriptional profiling, prognostic implications, genetic and epigenetic alterations, methylation patterns, and immunological significance. To validate our findings, we conducted Western blot analysis to assess TUBA1B protein levels in matched breast cancer tissue samples and performed CCK-8 proliferation assay, flow cytometry, transwell invasion, and migration assays to comprehensively examine the functional impact of TUBA1B on breast cancer cells. Our pan-cancer analysis found TUBA1B upregulation across most tumor types, with varying expression patterns in distinct immune and molecular subtypes. High TUBA1B expression was an independent risk factor and associated with poor prognoses in several cancers, including BRCA, KICH, LGG, LUAD, and MESO. TUBA1B also demonstrates moderate to high diagnostic accuracy in most tumor types. Increased m6A methylation levels were observed in the TUBA1B gene, while its promoter region displayed low methylation levels. TUBA1B's expression impacted some cancers by elevating tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, neoantigen formation, immune cell infiltration, and the modulation of immune checkpoints. Functional enrichment analysis highlights TUBA1B’s involvement in important cellular processes such as the cell cycle, p53 signaling, cell senescence, programmed cell death, and the regulation of immune-related pathways. Moreover, our study reveals higher TUBA1B protein expression in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent tissues. In vitro experiments confirm that TUBA1B deletion reduces breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while increasing apoptosis. In conclusion, our study suggests that TUBA1B could potentially serve as a diagnostic marker for predicting cancer immunological profiles and survival outcomes and shed light on the expression and role of TUBA1B in breast cancer, providing a solid foundation for considering it as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer patient treatment.",2024,2024-04-08 00:00:00,12.0,49.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a2fedfc6c4216151003b51e800bdf0184033942b

10.1177/15330338231178391,Tubulin Alpha-1b as a Potential Biomarker for Lung Adenocarcinoma Diagnosis and Prognosis,"Background: Because lung cancer is the main cause of cancer deaths and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for more than 40% of all lung malignancies, it is essential to develop clinically useful biomarkers for the disease. The aim of this investigation is to assess the potential application of tubulin alpha-1b (TUBA1B) as a biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring the outcome of LUAD. Methods: The clinical data of the LUAD patients was retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of a tissue microarray containing 90 LUAD cases was implemented to examine the expression of TUBA1B. The protein and mRNA levels of TUBA1B in serum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis respectively. UALCAN was employed to confirm the expression levels and survival probability of TUBA1B in LUAD patients. Results: Compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues in the microarray, the expression of TUBA1B in LUAD tissues was much higher. The expression of TUBA1B in LUAD was statistically correlated with lymph node status (P = .031). Moreover, patients with higher TUBA1B expression had shorter overall survival (P < .0001). Furthermore, cox multi-factor analysis also suggested that TUBA1B may be an independent predictor for LUAD prognosis (P = .030). The results of TCGA data analysis by UALCAN were consistent with the microarray results, except for that TUBA1B was also significantly correlated with clinical tumor stages. Protein levels of TUBA1B in serum were obviously elevated in LUAD patients than control (P < .0001), and the area under the ROC curve was 0.99. TUBA1B also showed better sensitivity of 92.9% for LUAD than common clinical biomarkers.

10.3390/genes14010124,An Aggrephagy-Related LncRNA Signature for the Prognosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a common, highly malignant, and aggressive gastrointestinal tumor. The conventional treatment of PAAD shows poor results, and patients have poor prognosis. The synthesis and degradation of proteins are essential for the occurrence and development of tumors. Aggrephagy is a type of autophagy that selectively degrades aggregated proteins. It decreases the formation of aggregates by degrading proteins, thus reducing the harm to cells. By breaking down proteins, it decreases the formation of aggregates; thus, minimizing damage to cells. For evaluating the response to immunotherapy and prognosis in PAAD patients, in this study, we developed a reliable signature based on aggrephagy-related genes (ARGs). We obtained 298 AGGLncRNAs. Based on the results of one-way Cox and LASSO analyses, the lncRNA signature was constructed. In the risk model, the prognosis of patients in the low-risk group was noticeably better than that of the patients in the high-risk group. Additionally, the ROC curves and nomograms validated the capacity of the risk model to predict the prognosis of PAAD. The patients in the low-risk and high-risk groups showed considerable variations in functional enrichment and immunological analysis. Regarding drug sensitivity, the low-risk and high-risk groups had different half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50).",2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,36.0,71.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a5e2d80e01a02bcee3d83a6526f5c0ae8f0c9b43
10.3390/cells11244063,Intersections of Ubiquitin-Proteosome System and Autophagy in Promoting Growth of Glioblastoma Multiforme: Challenges and Opportunities,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a brain tumor notorious for its propensity to recur after the standard treatments of surgical resection, ionizing radiation (IR), and temozolomide (TMZ). Combined with the acquired resistance to standard treatments and recurrence, GBM is an especially deadly malignancy with hardly any worthwhile treatment options. The treatment resistance of GBM is influenced, in large part, by the contributions from two main degradative pathways in eukaryotic cells: ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. These two systems influence GBM cell survival by removing and recycling cellular components that have been damaged by treatments, as well as by modulating metabolism and selective degradation of components of cell survival or cell death pathways. There has recently been a large amount of interest in potential cancer therapies involving modulation of UPS or autophagy pathways. There is significant crosstalk between the two systems that pose therapeutic challenges, including utilization of ubiquitin signaling, the degradation of components of one system by the other, and compensatory activation of autophagy in the case of proteasome inhibition for GBM cell survival and proliferation. There are several important regulatory nodes which have functions affecting both systems.

To facilitate data acquisition and analysis the contrast-enhanced perfusion is often omitted resulting in a biparametric prostate MRI protocol. The intention of this review is to analyze the current value of biparametric prostate MRI in combination with methods of machine-learning and deep learning in the detection, grading, and characterization of prostate cancer; if available a direct comparison with human radiologist performance was performed. PubMed was systematically queried and 29 appropriate studies were identified and retrieved. The data show that detection of clinically significant prostate cancer and differentiation of prostate cancer from non-cancerous tissue using machine-learning and deep learning is feasible with promising results.

Material and methods We used two publicly available datasets of postero-anterior chest radiographs, which are from Montgomery County, Maryland, and Shenzhen, China. A CNN (ConvNet) from scratch was trained to automatically detect TB on chest radiographs. Also, a CNN-based transfer learning approach using five different pre-trained models, including Inception_v3, Xception, ResNet50, VGG19, and VGG16 was utilized for classifying TB and normal cases from CXR images. The performance of models for testing datasets was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, precision, area under curve (AUC), and F1-score. Results All proposed models provided an acceptable accuracy for two-class classification. Our proposed CNN architecture (i.e., ConvNet) achieved 88.0% precision, 87.0% sensitivity, 87.0% F1-score, 87.0% accuracy, and AUC of 87.0%, which was slightly less than the pre-trained models. Among all models, Exception, ResNet50, and VGG16 provided the highest classification performance of automated TB classification with precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and AUC of 91.0%, and 90.0% accuracy. Conclusions Our study presents a transfer learning approach with deep CNNs to automatically classify TB and normal cases from the chest radiographs. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score for the detection of TB were found to be more than 87.0% for all models used in the study.

10.3322/caac.21708,"Cancer statistics, 2022","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes. Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized‐stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized‐stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3‐year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment.

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2‐fold to 3‐fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2‐fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy.

Background The importance of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and PET based imaging for the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer cannot be understated. Accurate staging has become another significant milestone with the use of PET scans, particularly with prostate specific radiotracers like 68-Gallium Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (68Ga-PSMA). Integrated PET/MRI systems are commercially available and can be modulated to evaluate the unique needs of localized as well as recurrent prostate cancer. Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar using the MeSH compliant and other keywords that included prostate cancer, PSA, mpMRI, PET CT, PET/MRI. Conclusions mpMRI has now established itself as the gold-standard of local prostate imaging and has been incorporated into international guidelines as part of the diagnostic work-up of prostate cancer. PSMA PET/CT has shown superiority over conventional imaging even in staging of localized prostate cancer based on recent randomized control data. Imaging parameters from PET/MRI have been shown to be associated with malignancy, Gleason score and tumour volume. As mpMRI and PSMA PET/CT become more ubiquitous and established; we can anticipate more high-quality data, cost optimization and increasing availability of PET/MRI to be ready for primetime in localized prostate cancer.",2021,2021-01-01 00:00:00,7.0,85.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/540b27a4855a1ab1d1cbe11d1bcc458ae9517ab7

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Public sector employees. Participants 3550 participants of the Finnish Retirement and Aging study. Primary and secondary outcome measures Participants estimated on a yearly questionnaire their weekly hours of different types of activities converted to metabolic equivalent of task-hour/week. Self-rated health was assessed on a 5-point Likert-like scale from poor to excellent and dichotomised as suboptimal and optimal. Multivariate trajectory analysis was used to distinguish different subgroups of trajectories. Multinomial regression analysis was used to describe the associations between covariates and the probability of being classified to a certain trajectory group. Results Three trajectory groups were identified, all displaying increasing activity during retirement with a simultaneous decrease in perceived suboptimal health. Physical activity peaked at 18 months after retirement and then slightly decreased, except for initially highly physically active participants (9%) with good self-rated health, who demonstrated a constant high level of physical activity. Male gender, professional occupation, being married or cohabiting, body mass index <30 kg/m2, not smoking and using alcohol below risk levels were associated with higher physical activity and better self-rated health. Conclusion Changes in physical activity and perceived health during retirement transition were interconnected. Both were improved during retirement transition, but the change was temporary.

Given the country’s aging population and recent liberalization of the two-child policy, understanding the effects of intergenerational caregiving on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals is crucial. This study aimed to explore the impact of intergenerational caregiving on mental health among middle-aged and older adult(s) individuals. Methods We analyzed data from the China Health and Aging Tracking Survey (CHARLS) 2013, consisting of 6602 participants finally. Personal information, family structure, financial support, health status, and physical measurements were selected for analysis. Correlation and regression analyses were used for relationships among variables controlling for potential confounding variables. Mental health status was evaluated using the depression self-rating scale. Results There is a significant positive effect of intergenerational care on the mental health of middle-aged and older adult(s) people. Additionally, we re-profiled intergenerational care variables by considering the number and length of intergenerational caregivers, and found that the effects remained significant. Furthermore, the effects of intergenerational care vary across subgroups based on gender, age, nature of usual residence, marital status, and physical health status. Finally, we identified two mechanisms through which intergenerational caregiving positively affects mental health: intergenerational financial support and intergenerational spiritual support.

Methods This exploratory-descriptive qualitative study was conducted in four provinces with the oldest populations in Iran. Semi-structured and focus group interviews were conducted with 41 participants (20 older adults and 21 geriatric experts), who were chosen through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were analyzed using the conventional content analysis. Results This study identified three themes and thirteen categories from the data: (1) basic individual needs with three categories of physiological, psycho-emotional, and spiritual needs; and (2) managerial needs with seven categories of political-legal, socio-economic, and cultural-spiritual infrastructures, academic strategies, an age-friendly environment; technological services, and provision of specialized services and daycare for older adults, and (3) educational needs with three categories of training self-care and self-efficacy, empowering the health care workers; and empowering the family.

However, these associations have not been explored using procedures that analyze the sequential effects between risk factors of falling. The present study aimed to examine the effects of muscle strength, agility, and fear of falling on risk of falling using path analysis in community-dwelling older adults. In total, 49 elderly (female = 33, male = 16) participants aged between 65 and 76 years (M = 68.38 years; SD = 6.22) were included for analysis. Muscle strength, agility, fear of falling, and risk of falling were assessed using validated instruments for the older adult population. The proposed model shows that muscle strength was negatively associated with agility. Consequently, agility was negatively associated with fear of falling. The same trend appeared between fear of falling and risk of falling. The effect sizes were between small and medium for agility (R2 = 0.16), fear of falling, (R2 = 0.29), and risk of falling (R2 = 0.03). The main finding of the present study was that muscle strength was significantly correlated with agility, which, in turn, predicted fear of falling. Consequently, lower scores for fear of falling explained lower risk of falling in community-dwelling older adults. While muscle strength is a crucial component of physical fitness, only with adequate levels of agility can older adults possess the efficacy and ability to perform daily tasks.",2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,22.0,38.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/989d201c64ef3de8ba5dbd33942bf4be94f507d2

This study systematically retrieved and analyzed articles on the psychological characteristics of older adult victims of online fraud. First, we found that there was no evidence that older adults were more prevalent than other individuals of other ages among online fraud victims, and current researchers have focused more on why older adults are easy targets for fraud (susceptibility to being cheated). Second, research on psychological factors of older adults' susceptibility to online fraud has mainly focused on cognitive function, trust traits, and other personality traits, such as social loneliness, the Big Five personality traits, and self-control. Among them, most researchers claim that the cyber-cheating of older adults may be due to a decline in their cognitive function. However, there has not been a consensus on how cognitive function and physical and mental conditions affect older people who are cheated. Third, techniques (i.e., methods and techniques used by fraudsters) and experience (i.e., familiarity with internet technology or fraud) may be related to the susceptibility of older adults to fraud, and these studies have also not yet generated a consensus supported by reliable data.

Understanding the reasons for the public’s negative opinions towards COVID-19 vaccination using Twitter may help make new headways in improving vaccine uptake. This study, therefore, examined the prevailing negative sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccination via the analysis of public twitter posts over a 16 month period. Original tweets (in English) from 1 April 2021 to 1 August 2022 were extracted. A bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based model was applied, and only negative sentiments tweets were selected. Topic modelling was used, followed by manual thematic analysis performed iteratively by the study investigators, with independent reviews of the topic labels and themes. A total of 4,448,314 tweets were analysed. The analysis generated six topics and three themes related to the prevailing negative sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccination. The themes could be broadly understood as either emotional reactions to perceived invidious policies or safety and effectiveness concerns related to the COVID-19 vaccines.

In fact, impaired sleep represents one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This systematic review aimed to analyze the studies on sleep quality in aging, also considering mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The review process was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. A total of 71 studies were included, and the whole sample had a mean age that ranged from 58.3 to 93.7 years (62.8–93.7 healthy participants and 61.8–86.7 pathological populations). Of these selected studies, 33 adopt subjective measurements, 31 adopt objective measures, and 10 studies used both. Pathological aging showed a worse impoverishment of sleep than older adults, in both subjective and objective measurements. The most common aspect compromised in AD and MCI were REM sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and sleep duration.

Objective To ascertain the state of the science on social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions to improve all-hazard household disaster preparedness. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Databases, trial registers, reports, and websites were searched, and citation trails followed utilizing replicable methods. Individual, cluster, and cross-over randomized controlled trials of non-institutionalized, community-dwelling populations and non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after, and program evaluation studies were included. At least two review authors independently screened each potentially relevant study for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane’s RoB2 tool for randomized studies and ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies. Meta-analyses were applied using a random-effects model. Where meta-analysis was not indicated, results were synthesized using summary statistics of intervention effect estimates and vote counting based on effect direction. The evidence was rated using GRADE. Results 17 studies were included with substantial methodological and clinical diversity. No intervention effect was observed for preparedness supplies (OR = 6.12, 95% 0.13 to 284.37) or knowledge (SMD = 0.96, 95% CI −0.15 to 2.08) outcomes. A small positive effect (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91) was observed for preparedness behaviors, with very low certainty of evidence. No studies reported adverse effects from the interventions. Conclusion Research designs elucidating the efficacy of practical yet complex and multi- faceted social support, educational, and behavioral modification interventions present substantial methodological challenges where rigorous study design elements may not match the contextual public health priority needs and resources where interventions were delivered. While the overall strength of the evidence was evaluated as low to very low, we acknowledge the valuable and informative work of the included studies. The research represents the seminal work in this field and provides an important foundation for the state of the science of household emergency preparedness intervention effectiveness and efficacy.

Using the academic databases SCOPUS, Web of Sciences, and databases accessible under Compendex and EBSCO-HOST and performing hit count frequency searches of online and downloaded abstracts and thematic analysis of downloaded abstracts the study reveals a lack of coverage on the social aspects of risk and engagement with risk concepts such as risk perception, risk governance, risk literacy, risk communication, risk education and risk narrative especially in conjunction with marginalized groups and technologies employed in EDMPP decision support. Our findings suggest many opportunities to further the EDMPP academic inquiry by filling the gaps.",2022,2022-12-26 00:00:00,14.0,283.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f5396863522340e3d38c21449f81c6ad54cbd27

10.1093/bioinformatics/btae197,DrivR-Base: a feature extraction toolkit for variant effect prediction model construction,"Motivation Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of numerous variants in the human genome. However, understanding their precise roles in diseases remains challenging due to their complex functional mechanisms. Various methodologies have emerged to predict the pathogenic significance of these genetic variants. Typically, these methods employ an integrative approach, leveraging diverse data sources that provide critical insights into genomic function. Despite the abundance of publicly available data sources and databases, the process of navigating, extracting, and pre-processing features for machine learning models can be daunting. Furthermore, researchers often invest substantial effort in feature extraction, only to later discover that these features lack informativeness. Results In this paper, we present DrivR-Base, an innovative resource that efficiently extracts and integrates molecular information (features) for single nucleotide variants from a wide range of databases and tools, including AlphaFold, ENCODE, and Variant Effect Predictor. The resulting features can be used as input for machine learning models designed to predict the pathogenic impact of human genome variants in disease. Moreover, these feature sets have applications beyond this, including haploinsufficiency prediction and the development of drug repurposing tools. We describe the resource’s development, practical applications, and potential for future expansion and enhancement.

Yet, few studies have integrated several multiplexed assays to map variant effects on gene expression in coding sequences. Here, we pioneered a multiplexed assay based on polysome profiling to measure variant effects on translation at scale, uncovering single-nucleotide variants that increase and decrease ribosome load. By combining high-throughput ribosome load data with multiplexed mRNA and protein abundance readouts, we mapped the cis-regulatory landscape of thousands of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) variants from RNA to protein and found numerous coding variants that alter COMT expression. Finally, we trained machine learning models to map signatures of variant effects on COMT gene expression and uncovered both directional and divergent impacts across expression layers. Our analyses reveal expression phenotypes for thousands of variants in COMT and highlight variant effects on both single and multiple layers of expression. Our findings prompt future studies that integrate several multiplexed assays for the readout of gene expression.",2023,2023-11-17 00:00:00,1.0,96.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b76329a07900d1c40f199af7529028e04099d67

This year has seen an emphasis in clinical data, with new tracks and an expanded Recommended Track Sets feature on hg38 as well as the addition of a single cell track group. SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain a focus, with regular annotation updates to the browser and continued curation of our phylogenetic sequence placing tool, hgPhyloPlace, whose tree has now reached over 12M sequences. Our GenArk resource has also grown, offering over 2500 hubs and a system for users to request any absent assemblies. We have expanded our bigBarChart display type and created new ways to visualize data via bigRmsk and dynseq display.

10.1038/s41431-022-01213-8,Somatic genetic variation in healthy tissue and non-cancer diseases,"Somatic genetic variants have been studied for several years mostly concerning cancer, where they contribute to its origin and development. It is also clear that the somatic variants load is greater in aged individuals in comparison to younger ones, pointing to a cause/consequence of the senescence process. More recently, researchers have focused on the role of this type of variation in healthy tissue and its dynamics in cell lineages and different organs. In addition, somatic variants have been described to contribute to monogenic diseases, and the number of evidences of their role in complex disorders is also increasing. Thanks to recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, this type of genetic variation can be now more easily studied than in the past, although we still face some important limitations. Novel strategies for sampling, sequencing and filtering are being investigated to detect these variants, although validating them with an orthogonal approach will most likely still be needed. In this review, we aim to update our knowledge of somatic variation detection and its relation to healthy tissue and non-cancer diseases.",2022,2022-10-27 00:00:00,8.0,71.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7344a23160f7b2786b7aeb21ba5fb0d0cf70708e
10.1093/nar/gkab772,Comprehensive characterization of somatic variants associated with intronic polyadenylation in human cancers,"Abstract Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in cancer genome affect gene expression through various mechanisms depending on their genomic location. While somatic SNVs near canonical splice sites have been reported to cause abnormal splicing of cancer-related genes, whether these SNVs can affect gene expression through other mechanisms remains an open question. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing and exome data from 4,998 cancer patients covering ten cancer types and identified 152 somatic SNVs near splice sites that were associated with abnormal intronic polyadenylation (IPA). IPA-associated somatic variants favored the localization near the donor splice sites compared to the acceptor splice sites. A proportion of SNV-associated IPA events overlapped with premature cleavage and polyadenylation events triggered by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) inhibition. GC content, intron length and polyadenylation signal were three genomic features that differentiated between SNV-associated IPA and intron retention. Notably, IPA-associated SNVs were enriched in tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including the well-known TSGs such as PTEN and CDH1 with recurrent SNV-associated IPA events. Minigene assay confirmed that SNVs from PTEN, CDH1, VEGFA, GRHL2, CUL3 and WWC2 could lead to IPA. This work reveals that IPA acts as a novel mechanism explaining the functional consequence of somatic SNVs in human cancer.",2021,2021-09-11 00:00:00,16.0,65.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fd709ab19019eac62c692e165c46e2593624b53
10.1186/s12915-020-00930-0,Current cancer driver variant predictors learn to recognize driver genes instead of functional variants,"Identifying variants that drive tumor progression (driver variants) and distinguishing these from variants that are a byproduct of the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer (passenger variants) is a crucial step for understanding tumorigenesis and precision oncology. Various bioinformatics methods have attempted to solve this complex task. In this study, we investigate the assumptions on which these methods are based, showing that the different definitions of driver and passenger variants influence the difficulty of the prediction task. More importantly, we prove that the data sets have a construction bias which prevents the machine learning (ML) methods to actually learn variant-level functional effects, despite their excellent performance. This effect results from the fact that in these data sets, the driver variants map to a few driver genes, while the passenger variants spread across thousands of genes, and thus just learning to recognize driver genes provides almost perfect predictions. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel data set that minimizes this bias by ensuring that all genes covered by the data contain both driver and passenger variants. As a result, we show that the tested predictors experience a significant drop in performance, which should not be considered as poorer modeling, but rather as correcting unwarranted optimism. Finally, we propose a weighting procedure to completely eliminate the gene effects on such predictions, thus precisely evaluating the ability of predictors to model the functional effects of single variants, and we show that indeed this task is still open.",2021,2021-01-13 00:00:00,19.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4f275dd8e4afc0af33d8a7239d50a9ab0fe72d5
10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa242,CScape-somatic: distinguishing driver and passenger point mutations in the cancer genome,"Abstract Motivation Next-generation sequencing technologies have accelerated the discovery of single nucleotide variants in the human genome, stimulating the development of predictors for classifying which of these variants are likely functional in disease, and which neutral. Recently, we proposed CScape, a method for discriminating between cancer driver mutations and presumed benign variants. For the neutral class, this method relied on benign germline variants found in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Discrimination could, therefore, be influenced by the distinction of germline versus somatic, rather than neutral versus disease driver. This motivates this article in which we consider predictive discrimination between recurrent and rare somatic single point mutations based solely on using cancer data, and the distinction between these two somatic classes and germline single point mutations. Results For somatic point mutations in coding and non-coding regions of the genome, we propose CScape-somatic, an integrative classifier for predictively discriminating between recurrent and rare variants in the human cancer genome. In this study, we use purely cancer genome data and investigate the distinction between minimal occurrence and significantly recurrent somatic single point mutations in the human cancer genome. We show that this type of predictive distinction can give novel insight, and may deliver more meaningful prediction in both coding and non-coding regions of the cancer genome. Tested on somatic mutations, CScape-somatic outperforms alternative methods, reaching 74% balanced accuracy in coding regions and 69% in non-coding regions, whereas even higher accuracy may be achieved using thresholds to isolate high-confidence predictions.

Here, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing (average read depth 584×) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation and matched blood samples from 52 patients with AD and 11 individuals not affected by AD. The number of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in AD brain specimens increases significantly with aging, and the rate of mutation accumulation in the brain is 4.8-fold slower than that in AD blood. The putatively pathogenic brain somatic mutations identified in 26.9% (14 of 52) of AD individuals are enriched in PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway genes known to contribute to hyperphosphorylation of tau. We show that a pathogenic brain somatic mutation in PIN1 leads to a loss-of-function mutation. In vitro mimicking of haploinsufficiency of PIN1 aberrantly increases tau phosphorylation and aggregation. This study provides new insights into the genetic architecture underlying the pathogenesis of AD. The role of brain somatic mutations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not well understood.

The vibration of the in-core sensors near their nominal locations is a new problem for neutronic field reconstruction. Current field-reconstruction methods fail to handle spatially moving sensors. In this study, we propose a Voronoi tessellation technique in combination with convolutional neural networks to handle this challenge. Observations from movable in-core sensors were projected onto the same global field structure using Voronoi tessellation, holding the magnitude and location information of the sensors. General convolutional neural networks were used to learn maps from observations to the global field. The proposed method reconstructed multi-physics fields (including fast flux, thermal flux, and power rate) using observations from a single field (such as thermal flux). Numerical tests based on the IAEA benchmark demonstrated the potential of the proposed method in practical engineering applications, particularly within an amplitude of 5 cm around the nominal locations, which led to average relative errors below 5% and 10% in the $$L_2$$

10.3390/s21144846,Prediction of Pest Insect Appearance Using Sensors and Machine Learning,"The appearance of pest insects can lead to a loss in yield if farmers do not respond in a timely manner to suppress their spread. Occurrences and numbers of insects can be monitored through insect traps, which include their permanent touring and checking of their condition. Another more efficient way is to set up sensor devices with a camera at the traps that will photograph the traps and forward the images to the Internet, where the pest insect’s appearance will be predicted by image analysis. Weather conditions, temperature and relative humidity are the parameters that affect the appearance of some pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera. This paper presents a model of machine learning that can predict the appearance of insects during a season on a daily basis, taking into account the air temperature and relative humidity. Several machine learning algorithms for classification were applied and their accuracy for the prediction of insect occurrence was presented (up to 76.5%). Since the data used for testing were given in chronological order according to the days when the measurement was performed, the existing model was expanded to take into account the periods of three and five days. The extended method showed better accuracy of prediction and a lower percentage of false detections. In the case of a period of five days, the accuracy of the affected detections was 86.3%, while the percentage of false detections was 11%. The proposed model of machine learning can help farmers to detect the occurrence of pests and save the time and resources needed to check the fields.",2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,45.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/648350eb70d4454a893075ff8425d4ad6530ce3b

10.3390/s21062016,Integrating a Low-Cost Electronic Nose and Machine Learning Modelling to Assess Coffee Aroma Profile and Intensity,"Aroma is one of the main attributes that consumers consider when appreciating and selecting a coffee; hence it is considered an important quality trait. However, the most common methods to assess aroma are based on expensive equipment or human senses through sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and requires highly trained assessors to avoid subjectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the coffee intensity and aromas using a low-cost and portable electronic nose (e-nose) and machine learning modeling. For this purpose, triplicates of nine commercial coffee samples with different intensity levels were used for this study. Two machine learning models were developed based on artificial neural networks using the data from the e-nose as inputs to (i) classify the samples into low, medium, and high-intensity (Model 1) and (ii) to predict the relative abundance of 45 different aromas (Model 2). Results showed that it is possible to estimate the intensity of coffees with high accuracy (98%; Model 1), as well as to predict the specific aromas obtaining a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99), and no under- or over-fitting of the models were detected. The proposed contactless, nondestructive, rapid, reliable, and low-cost method showed to be effective in evaluating volatile compounds in coffee, which is a potential technique to be applied within all stages of the production process to detect any undesirable characteristics on–time and ensure high-quality products.",2021,2021-03-01 00:00:00,66.0,67.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c32bb19d177d0992563ea12bb19558a61205d23e

10.1007/s10340-020-01309-4,Insect pest monitoring with camera-equipped traps: strengths and limitations,"Integrated pest management relies on insect pest monitoring to support the decision of counteracting a given level of infestation and to select the adequate control method. The classic monitoring approach of insect pests is based on placing in single infested areas a series of traps that are checked by human operators on a temporal basis. This strategy requires high labor cost and provides poor spatial and temporal resolution achievable by single operators. The adoption of image sensors to monitor insect pests can result in several practical advantages. The purpose of this review is to summarize the progress made on automatic traps with a particular focus on camera-equipped traps. The use of software and image recognition algorithms can support automatic trap usage to identify and/or count insect species from pictures. Considering the high image resolution achievable and the opportunity to exploit data transfer systems through wireless technology, it is possible to have remote control of insect captures, limiting field visits. The availability of real-time and on-line pest monitoring systems from a distant location opens the opportunity for measuring insect population dynamics constantly and simultaneously in a large number of traps with a limited human labor requirement. The actual limitations are the high cost, the low power autonomy and the low picture quality of some prototypes together with the need for further improvements in fully automated pest detection. Limits and benefits resulting from several case studies are examined with a perspective for the future development of technology-driven insect pest monitoring and management.",2020,2020-12-04 00:00:00,145.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f678b68c67851298a509fb342531ad5c785c4d00

The evolution of the activities of the GSC over this period has been driven by evolving geographic, economic and political contexts and needs. Likewise, new technologies and evolving scientific methods and models shaped broadly the successive generations of GSC geoscience activities. The most recent GSC generation presented a mixed portfolio of large framework mapping geoscience programmes, and more targeted, hypothesis-driven geoscience research, and the development of decision support products for a range of government, industry and other stakeholders needs. Entering its eighth generation, the GSC and related organizations are embracing digital technologies for applications such as the evaluation of mineral resource potential, the evaluation of risks and the early warning of earthquakes. In order to do so, the GSC will need to develop new methods and systems in co-operation with other geological survey organizations, and target its data acquisition and research to further advance its ability to respond to the evolving needs of society to navigate geology through space and time, from the past to the present, and from the present to the future.",2019,2019-11-22 00:00:00,5.0,35.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fe4817185d4935c1d836876c2f0902c66d8f3ea

10.1155/2022/7751263,Review on Epileptic Seizure Prediction: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches,"Epileptic seizures occur due to brain abnormalities that can indirectly affect patient's health. It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world's population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.",2022,2022-01-20 00:00:00,54.0,84.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a814dd75b527314e694805539d53faf5d9bf3b72

10.1503/cmaj.151171,Perceptions of palliative care among patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers,"Background: Early palliative care is increasingly recommended but seldom practised. We sought to examine perceptions of palliative care among patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. Methods: After conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial of early palliative care versus standard care for patients with advanced cancer, we approached patients and their caregivers to participate in semistructured interviews seeking to assess, qualitatively, their attitudes and perceptions about palliative care. We used the grounded theory method for data collection and analysis. Results: A total of 48 patients (26 intervention, 22 control) and 23 caregivers (14 intervention, 9 control) completed interviews. Participants’ initial perceptions of palliative care in both trial arms were of death, hopelessness, dependency and end-of-life comfort care for inpatients. These perceptions provoked fear and avoidance, and often originated from interactions with health care professionals. During the trial, those in the intervention arm developed a broader concept of palliative care as “ongoing care” that improved their “quality of living” but still felt that the term itself carried a stigma. Participants in the intervention group emphasized the need for palliative care to be reframed and better explained by health care professionals. Participants in the control group generally considered it pointless to rename palliative care, but many in the intervention group stated emphatically that a different name was necessary in the early outpatient setting. Interpretation: There is a strong stigma attached to palliative care, which may persist even after positive experiences with an early palliative care intervention. Education of the public, patients and health care providers is paramount if early integration of palliative care is to be successful.",2016,2016-04-18 00:00:00,316.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1e931367ab89c29d3ccc138350c2b97d4715a66

10.3390/APP11073201,Automated Software Vulnerability Detection Based on Hybrid Neural Network,"Vulnerabilities threaten the security of information systems. It is crucial to detect and patch vulnerabilities before attacks happen. However, existing vulnerability detection methods suffer from long-term dependency, out of vocabulary, bias towards global features or local features, and coarse detection granularity. This paper proposes an automatic vulnerability detection framework in source code based on a hybrid neural network. First, the inputs are transformed into an intermediate representation with explicit structure information using lower level virtual machine intermediate representation (LLVM IR) and backward program slicing. After the transformation, the size of samples and the size of vocabulary are significantly reduced. A hybrid neural network model is then applied to extract high-level features of vulnerability, which learns features both from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The former is applied to learn local vulnerability features, such as buffer size. Furthermore, the latter is utilized to learn global features, such as data dependency. The extracted features are made up of concatenated outputs of CNN and RNN. Experiments are performed to validate our vulnerability detection method. The results show that our proposed method achieves excellent results with F1-scores of 98.6% and accuracy of 99.0% on the SARD dataset. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",2021,2021-04-02 00:00:00,27.0,47.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac701065bdcff3322e4ea8b8a4e2a6df0fe831b1

10.1155/2013/350358,Computational Systems Biology,"The complex biological systems consist of distinct molecules that exert their functions by interacting with each other, which makes it a big challenge to understand how the cellular machinery works. Recently, the accumulation of a large amount of multiscale omics data, such as next-generation sequencing data and protein interaction data, provides opportunity to investigate the functions of molecules from a systematic perspective. On the other hand, the analysis of these huge datasets demands efficient and robust computational methods. In this special issue, we reported the recent progress made in developing new computational methodologies to analyze the genomics data, construct gene networks, and identify disease genes. 
 
Understanding the Functions of Molecules in the Postgenomic Age. In recent years, the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology makes it more easier for researchers to access and analyze genetics data and has influential effects on the biomedical research community. However, compared with sequencing, computational analysis of the flooding sequencing data with appropriate tools is becoming a more important task when interpreting the data. In their review paper, M. P. Dolled-Filhart et al. described the pipeline for bioinformatics analysis of the NGS data, starting from alignment to variant calling as well as filtering and annotation. In each step, they discussed the tools or software that should be used as well as their advantages and caveats. This survey of the bioinformatics analysis of NGS data can help researchers to choose appropriate tools when dealing with the sequencing data. 
 
Along with the sequencing technology, lines of evidence show that a lot of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes. Unlike the protein-coding genes that are well studied, the functions of most ncRNAs are not clear. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop computational methods to predict the functions of the ncRNAs. H. Ma et al. conducted a survey about the computational approaches developed to predict and annotate the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which can help researchers to learn the progress in this filed and future directions in which bioinformaticists should work while annotating lncRNAs. 
 
While annotating the functions of molecules, standard and controlled vocabularies are required. Hence, the ontologies that are represented as abstract description systems of knowledge are becoming more and more popular recently. At the same time, it is becoming a difficult task to calculate the semantic similarity between ontology terms quantitatively. M. Gan et al. introduced popular methods in quantitating the semantic similarity between ontology terms and their software implementations. Furthermore, they classified these methods into distinct categories and discussed their advantages and shortcomings, which can help researchers to select appropriate tools and methods when working on ontologies. 
 
Gene expression profiles can describe the molecular mechanisms that underlie certain phenotypes. However, while analyzing the gene expression data, it is inappropriate to treat genes independently considering genes interact with each other within the cell. O. Frings et al. proposed a network-based approach to analyze the gene expression data and applied it to investigate the development of sex-specific chicken gonad and brain tissues. By combining the chicken network and the gene expression data, they identified some sex-biased characteristics, for example, same sex-biased genes tend to be tightly connected in the network, and provided new insights into the molecular underpinnings of sex-biased genes. 
 
Construction and Analysis of Gene Networks. Construction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a crucial step in systems biology, where gene expression data is widely explored to infer the GRNs. However, the high dimensionality and notorious noise of the gene expression data makes it a nontrivial task to infer the GRNs. N. You et al. presented a new Laplace error penalty (LEP) model to calculate the partial correlation coefficients between genes and construct the GRNs. Compared with the popular least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) approaches, the LEP method reached the highest precision. Except for gene expression data, integration of different data sources may improve the accuracy of inferred GRNs. H. Chen et al. surveyed the strategies to integrate distinct data sources and their effectiveness and recommended how to choose an appropriate strategy while integrating distinct data sources. N. Nakajima et al. proposed a novel network completion approach, DPLSQ, to infer gene networks. Benchmarking on artificial datasets, their proposed DPLSQ outperforms popular ARACNE and GeneNet with the highest accuracy. By investigating a 2-gene network, A. V. Spirov et al. found that gene cooption can affect the robustness of GRNs, and the findings provide new insights into the evolvability and robustness of GRNs. 
 
Network modules are found to be functional blocks of gene networks, the identification of which is becoming a hot research topic. By taking the hierarchical modular structure into account, S. Zhang presented a new stochastic block model to detect the hierarchical modules. Applied to the real yeast gene coexpression network, the proposed method can efficiently detect the hierarchical modular structures that are consistent with biological functions. Recently, it is found that a particular type of ncRNAs, microRNAs, plays important roles in gene regulation by working together with transcription factors. W. Mu et al. proposed a new local genetic algorithm to predict condition-specific regulatory modules that consist of microRNAs, transcription factors, and their commonly regulated genes, and these modules provide useful insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression. 
 
Computational Approaches to Hunting Disease-Associated Genes. The identification of genetic variants that are responsible for human diseases is critical for understanding the development of diseases and designing new effective drugs. Thanks to the genome-wide association studies (GWASs), some genetic variants that drive diseases have been identified, among which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are receiving more and more attention. In this issue, J. Wu and R. Jiang reviewed the databases that collect nsSNPs and summarized popular computational methods that identify deleterious nsSNPs. In addition, they introduced machine learning models that are useful in predicting deleterious nsSNPs. Beyond SNP-based association analysis, gene-based association analysis is receiving increasing attention. X. Guo et al. comprehensively compared these two approaches on the data from the study of addiction and found that these two approaches complement with each other and can get better results when used together. 
 
The differentially expressed genes identified from microarray data are generally regarded as candidate disease genes. However, the number of differentially expressed genes may reach hundreds or even thousands, thereby making it difficult to identify the potential disease genes. In this issue, L. Li et al. proposed a new hybrid approach to predict disease genes based on estimation of distribution algorithm and support vector machine. Benchmarking on B-cell lymphoma and colon cancer datasets, their method outperforms two other popular approaches and identify some new candidate genes for future validation.",2013,2013-03-12 00:00:00,653.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e8056466cd94a05011a683b22b742b61a2c052f

10.1186/s10033-023-00843-3,Fatigue Life Prediction for SiC/Al Materials Based on Path Planning Algorithm Considering Residual Stress,"To explore the influence of path deflection on crack propagation, a path planning algorithm is presented to calculate the crack growth length. The fatigue crack growth life of metal matrix composites (MMCs) is estimated based on an improved Paris formula. Considering the different expansion coefficient of different materials, the unequal shrinkage will lead to residual stress when the composite is molded and cooled. The crack growth model is improved by the modified stress ratio based on residual stress. The Dijkstra algorithm is introduced to avoid the cracks passing through the strengthening base and the characteristics of crack steps. This model can be extended to predict crack growth length for other similarly-structured composite materials. The shortest path of crack growth is simulated by using path planning algorithm, and the fatigue life of composites is calculated based on the shortest path and improved model. And the residual stress caused by temperature change is considered to improve the fatigue crack growth model in the material. The improved model can well predict the fatigue life curve of composites. By analyzing the fatigue life of composites, it is found that there is a certain regularity based on metal materials, and the new fatigue prediction model can also reflect this regularity.",2023,2023-02-20 00:00:00,5.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc9b7bf86a8f750fff4c019fd3ae599389cb7a99

10.3390/pr11010082,Review of Methods for Diagnosing Faults in the Stators of BLDC Motors,"A brushless direct current (BLDC) motor is a type of permanent magnet machine that is highly efficient and powerful and requires occasional maintenance. Thanks to these fortunate characteristics, this type of motor has various applications in high-tech industries. However, since BLDC motors are often required to operate at high-speed rotations and under extreme conditions, temperature overshoots can appear during operation, provoking damage to the windings. The purpose of this review is to present the results of a recent investigation and recollection of different methods used for the diagnosis of electrical faults in the stator, such as turn-to-turn short circuits, coil-to-coil short circuits, phase-to-phase short circuits and phase open circuits. In particular, this review presents an analysis of the available diagnosis methods according to the type of fault, the method or technique used for the diagnosis, the evaluated physical variables and the context in which the methods were evaluated (in simulations or in experimental tests). Based on this analysis, the following classifications of diagnostic methods are proposed: signal-based, model-based and data-based methods.

10.3389/fnmol.2021.807969,Gabaergic Interneurons in Early Brain Development: Conducting and Orchestrated by Cortical Network Activity,"Throughout early phases of brain development, the two main neural signaling mechanisms—excitation and inhibition—are dynamically sculpted in the neocortex to establish primary functions. Despite its relatively late formation and persistent developmental changes, the GABAergic system promotes the ordered shaping of neuronal circuits at the structural and functional levels. Within this frame, interneurons participate first in spontaneous and later in sensory-evoked activity patterns that precede cortical functions of the mature brain. Upon their subcortical generation, interneurons in the embryonic brain must first orderly migrate to and settle in respective target layers before they can actively engage in cortical network activity. During this process, changes at the molecular and synaptic level of interneurons allow not only their coordinated formation but also the pruning of connections as well as excitatory and inhibitory synapses. At the postsynaptic site, the shift of GABAergic signaling from an excitatory towards an inhibitory response is required to enable synchronization within cortical networks. Concomitantly, the progressive specification of different interneuron subtypes endows the neocortex with distinct local cortical circuits and region-specific modulation of neuronal firing. Finally, the apoptotic process further refines neuronal populations by constantly maintaining a controlled ratio of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Interestingly, many of these fundamental and complex processes are influenced—if not directly controlled—by electrical activity. Interneurons on the subcellular, cellular, and network level are affected by high frequency patterns, such as spindle burst and gamma oscillations in rodents and delta brushes in humans. Conversely, the maturation of interneuron structure and function on each of these scales feeds back and contributes to the generation of cortical activity patterns that are essential for the proper peri- and postnatal development. Overall, a more precise description of the conducting role of interneurons in terms of how they contribute to specific activity patterns—as well as how specific activity patterns impinge on their maturation as orchestra members—will lead to a better understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological development and function of the nervous system.",2022,2022-01-03 00:00:00,32.0,230.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75eb4e19edd7d78a2dff8da5746952ba92dba391
10.3389/fnins.2021.699583,Neuronal Activity Patterns Regulate Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Expression in Cortical Cells via Neuronal Circuits,"During development, cortical circuits are remodeled by spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity via alteration of the expression of wiring molecules. An intriguing question is how physiological neuronal activity modifies the expression of these molecules in developing cortical networks. Here, we addressed this issue, focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the factors underlying cortical wiring. Real-time imaging of BDNF promoter activity in organotypic slice cultures revealed that patterned stimuli differentially regulated the increase and the time course of the promoter activity in upper layer neurons. Calcium imaging further demonstrated that stimulus-dependent increases in the promoter activity were roughly proportional to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration per unit time. Finally, optogenetic stimulation showed that the promoter activity was increased efficiently by patterned stimulation in defined cortical circuits. These results suggest that physiological stimulation patterns differentially tune activity-dependent gene expression in developing cortical neurons via cortical circuits, synaptic responses, and alteration of intracellular calcium signaling.",2021,2021-12-10 00:00:00,15.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85bea617bbce6c876755555dfbdc98947cf7b1f5
10.1038/s41598-021-99538-9,Early prediction of developing spontaneous activity in cultured neuronal networks,"Synchronization and bursting activity are intrinsic electrophysiological properties of in vivo and in vitro neural networks. During early development, cortical cultures exhibit a wide repertoire of synchronous bursting dynamics whose characterization may help to understand the parameters governing the transition from immature to mature networks. Here we used machine learning techniques to characterize and predict the developing spontaneous activity in mouse cortical neurons on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) during the first three weeks in vitro. Network activity at three stages of early development was defined by 18 electrophysiological features of spikes, bursts, synchrony, and connectivity. The variability of neuronal network activity during early development was investigated by applying k-means and self-organizing map (SOM) clustering analysis to features of bursts and synchrony. These electrophysiological features were predicted at the third week in vitro with high accuracy from those at earlier times using three machine learning models: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. Our results indicate that initial patterns of electrical activity during the first week in vitro may already predetermine the final development of the neuronal network activity. The methodological approach used here may be applied to explore the biological mechanisms underlying the complex dynamics of spontaneous activity in developing neuronal cultures.",2021,2021-10-14 00:00:00,15.0,66.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58fc13bea4d3877b2acd7c0b071e9adf41c74e92

10.3390/ijms22126575,Optogenetically Controlled Activity Pattern Determines Survival Rate of Developing Neocortical Neurons,"A substantial proportion of neurons undergoes programmed cell death (apoptosis) during early development. This process is attenuated by increased levels of neuronal activity and enhanced by suppression of activity. To uncover whether the mere level of activity or also the temporal structure of electrical activity affects neuronal death rates, we optogenetically controlled spontaneous activity of synaptically-isolated neurons in developing cortical cultures. Our results demonstrate that action potential firing of primary cortical neurons promotes neuronal survival throughout development. Chronic patterned optogenetic stimulation allowed to effectively modulate the firing pattern of single neurons in the absence of synaptic inputs while maintaining stable overall activity levels. Replacing the burst firing pattern with a non-physiological, single pulse pattern significantly increased cell death rates as compared to physiological burst stimulation. Furthermore, physiological burst stimulation led to an elevated peak in intracellular calcium and an increase in the expression level of classical activity-dependent targets but also decreased Bax/BCL-2 expression ratio and reduced caspase 3/7 activity. In summary, these results demonstrate at the single-cell level that the temporal pattern of action potentials is critical for neuronal survival versus cell death fate during cortical development, besides the pro-survival effect of action potential firing per se.",2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,14.0,73.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12f2b417ab723fbab0feaa3df60027029438f5bb

Early prognosis is currently based on cranial ultrasound (CUS), MRI, EEG, NIRS, and/or general movements assessed at specific ages, and predicting outcome in an individual (precision medicine) is not yet possible. New algorithms based on large databases and machine learning applied to clinical, neuromonitoring, and neuroimaging data and genetic analysis and assays measuring multiple biomarkers (omics) can fulfill the needs of modern neonatology. A synergy of all these techniques and the use of automatic quantitative analysis might give clinicians the possibility to provide patient-targeted decision-making for individualized diagnosis, therapy, and outcome prediction.

Along this journey, Digital Twin has been introduced to the industry as a concept that holds the promise to challenge the status-quo and address long standing problems of productivity, efficiency, and value. While this concept is becoming more familiar among practitioners, there is a lack of universal definitions of what the Digital Twin of a construction project is. Additionally, while identifying the purpose of Digital Twin is recognized as the first step in implementing Digital Twins, there is little discussion on the perception of construction practitioners of the extent to which Digital Twin can deliver value. To address these research gaps and building on the existing work on Digital Twins in the context of the construction industry, this paper first proposes a definition of the Digital Twin of a construction project. Next, a series of semi-structured interviews are conducted with nine construction practitioners to understand their perceptions on the use and challenges of Digital Twins. Thematic analysis is then used to analyze interview data and summarize Digital Twins applications, capabilities, and challenges. Forty direct applications were identified and grouped into seven capabilities. Digital Twins capabilities of Increase Transparency of Information and Real-Time Monitoring, Analysis, and Feedback were the most discussed with a total of eight applications each, followed by Better Stakeholder Collaboration which had seven applications. The discussion on challenges led to the identification of 34 challenges to implementing Digital Twin, grouped into six categories coded through thematic analysis. The category on Data Understanding, Preparation, and Usage Challenges was found to be the most critical for the interviewees. Additionally, the paper presents a case study on how building authority can be integrated into Digital Twins and leverage its use throughout the lifecycle of a building.

In light of the spread of digital technology and modern managerial approaches, the concept of a digital twin is being used on a large scale with the current trend and direction to digitalize activities providing many economic, social and technical advantages. A digital twin is a system in which a virtual representation of a real entity or physical system is used continuously by being fed with data and deriving outputs in the form of decisions and actions that are generated through the processes of machine learning, simulation, development and lifecycle management. This study aims to review the literature on construction project management through the lens of digital twins and ways to use them in the field to improve operational results. The authors propose a framework for analyzing and supervising the development of digital twins that uses three main stages: the commonly encountered Building Information Modeling (BIM); the existing monitoring and actuation digital twins; and an envisioned third stage that makes use of artificial intelligence, complex visualization instruments and advanced controls with the capability to exact change within a construction project on the building site.",2022,2022-03-13 00:00:00,53.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b40e8d783ba09927141912cb184728d0c88ac679

Because of the complexity and non-linearity, a visual interpretation of FHR signals using common guidelines usually results in significant subjective inter-observer and intra-observer variability. Objective: Therefore, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology have recently been developed to assist obstetricians in making objective medical decisions.MethodsIn this work, we present an 8-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to automatically predict fetal acidemia. After signal preprocessing, the input 2-dimensional (2D) images are obtained using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which provides a better way to observe and capture the hidden characteristic information of the FHR signals in both the time and frequency domains. Unlike the conventional machine learning (ML) approaches, this work does not require the execution of complex feature engineering, i.e., feature extraction and selection. In fact, 2D CNN model can self-learn useful features from the input data with the prerequisite of not losing informative features, representing the tremendous advantage of deep learning (DL) over ML.ResultsBased on the test open-access database (CTU-UHB), after comprehensive experimentation, we achieved better classification performance using the optimal CNN configuration compared to other state-of-the-art methods: the averaged ten-fold cross-validation of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, quality index defined as the geometric mean of the sensitivity and specificity, and the area under the curve yielded results of 98.34, 98.22, 94.87, 96.53 and 97.82%, respectivelyConclusionsOnce the proposed CNN model is successfully trained, the corresponding CAD system can be served as an effective tool to predict fetal asphyxia objectively and accurately.",2019,2019-12-01 00:00:00,104.0,58.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3f31f9f34df9962c0ef24a8d9c2067a04127708

Methods: CTG data of 2126 pregnant women were obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Ten different machine learning classification models were trained using CTG data. Sensitivity, precision, and F1 score for each class and overall accuracy of each model were obtained to predict normal, suspect, and pathological fetal states. Model with best performance on specified metrics was then identified. Results: Determined by obstetricians' interpretation of CTGs as gold standard, 70% of them were normal, 20% were suspect, and 10% had a pathological fetal state. On training data, the classification models generated by XGBoost, decision tree, and random forest had high precision (>96%) to predict the suspect and pathological state of the fetus based on the CTG tracings. However, on testing data, XGBoost model had the highest precision to predict a pathological fetal state (>92%). Conclusion: The classification model developed using XGBoost technique had the highest prediction accuracy for an adverse fetal outcome. Lay health-care workers in low- and middle-income countries can use this model to triage pregnant women in remote areas for early referral and further management.",2019,2019-10-01 00:00:00,53.0,24.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/833e06df42d84d9787fbdd7a384d1cb5ddbd8dc9

However, the lack of regularly updated, continental-scale, and high spatial resolution (30 m) land cover data limit our ability to better understand the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of land surface changes. Despite the free availability of high spatial resolution Landsat satellite data, continental-scale land cover mapping using high resolution Landsat satellite data was not feasible until now due to the need for high-performance computing to store, process, and analyze this large volume of high resolution satellite data. In this study, we present an approach to quantify continental land cover and impervious surface changes over a long period of time (15 years) using high resolution Landsat satellite observations and Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of concerns associated with AI fairness; discuss strategies to mitigate AI biases; and emphasize the need for cooperation among physicians, AI researchers, AI developers, policymakers, and patients to ensure equitable AI integration. First, we define and introduce the concept of fairness in AI applications in healthcare and radiology, emphasizing the benefits and challenges of incorporating AI into clinical practice. Next, we delve into concerns regarding fairness in healthcare, addressing the various causes of biases in AI and potential concerns such as misdiagnosis, unequal access to treatment, and ethical considerations. We then outline strategies for addressing fairness, such as the importance of diverse and representative data and algorithm audits. Additionally, we discuss ethical and legal considerations such as data privacy, responsibility, accountability, transparency, and explainability in AI.

10.1515/popets-2017-0046,"Bayes, not Naïve: Security Bounds on Website Fingerprinting Defenses","Abstract Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks raise major concerns about users’ privacy. They employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to allow a local passive adversary to uncover the Web browsing behavior of a user, even if she browses through an encrypted tunnel (e.g. Tor, VPN). Numerous defenses have been proposed in the past; however, it is typically difficult to have formal guarantees on their security, which is most often evaluated empirically against state-of-the-art attacks. In this paper, we present a practical method to derive security bounds for any WF defense, where the bounds depend on a chosen feature set. This result derives from reducing WF attacks to an ML classification task, where we can determine the smallest achievable error (the Bayes error). Such error can be estimated in practice, and is a lower bound for a WF adversary, for any classification algorithm he may use. Our work has two main consequences: i) it allows determining the security of WF defenses, in a black-box manner, with respect to the state-of-the-art feature set and ii) it favors shifting the focus of future WF research to identifying optimal feature sets. The generality of this approach further suggests that the method could be used to define security bounds for other ML-based attacks.",2017,2017-02-24 00:00:00,37.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f0afe85012146ba0791eff4f0075494a53534fe

10.1007/s00193-020-00968-7,Development of a new empirical formula for prediction of triple point path,"This paper develops a new empirical formula for the prediction of the triple point path in irregular shock reflection cases. Numerical simulations using a two-dimensional axisymmetric multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation are employed to obtain the data of fluid density. Using the data of fluid density and nodal coordinates, the gradients of fluid density are determined and then used to generate numerical schlieren images. Based on these images, the triple point paths are derived and compared with the models of the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) as well as two models from the open literature. It is found that the numerically derived triple point paths are in good agreement with those predicted by a recently published model in the open literature for the typical ground range of shock wave propagation of up to 6 m. Considering the whole distance range, it is found that the agreement of different models of the triple point path with the numerical ones depends on the considered blast scenario, i.e., the scaled charge height. For small-scaled charge heights, the model of the UFC and the recently published model in the open literature are in better agreement with the numerical results than the other two models, whereas the NRDC model has the best agreement with the numerical results for large-scaled charge heights. Based on the numerical results, a new empirical formula is proposed for the prediction of the triple point path, which is valid for a wide range of the scaled charge heights from 0.5 to 3.5 m/kg1/3 and scaled ground distances up to 15 m/kg1/3.",2020,2020-09-01 00:00:00,17.0,17.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/733081bd3dee71b38ca0ec425554ed15ceab1459

Machine learning evolved from the study of pattern recognition and explores the notion that algorithms can learn from and make predictions on data. And, as they begin to become more ‘intelligent’, these algorithms can overcome program instructions to make highly accurate, data-driven decisions. Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques (including machine learning, predictive modelling and data mining) and uses statistics (both historical and current) to estimate, or ‘predict’, future outcomes. These outcomes might be behaviors of a customer likely to exhibit or possible changes in the market, for example.

10.3390/cancers15245759,Prognostic Implications of LRP1B and Its Relationship with the Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells in Gastric Cancer,"Simple Summary Gastric cancer (GC) has a poor prognosis, as it has often grown into an advanced stage when diagnosed. Genetic testing is crucial for establishing a treatment plan. In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to discover that LRP1B mutation was associated with a poor prognosis in GC. Through layer-by-layer research, it was found that LRP1B expression in GC was accompanied by a higher-level infiltration of CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163. It is concluded that LRP1B expression can stimulate tumor immune cell infiltration, thus bringing clinical benefits to GC patients. Abstract Background: Recent studies have shown that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1b (LRP1B), as a potential tumor suppressor, is implicated in the response to immunotherapy. The frequency of LRP1B mutation gene is high in many cancers, but its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not been determined. Methods: The prognostic value of LRP1B mutation in a cohort containing 100 patients having received radical gastrectomy for stage II–III GC was explored. By analyzing the data of LRP1B mRNA, the risk score of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LRP1B mutation-type and wild-type was constructed based on the TCGA-STAD cohort. The infiltration of tumor immune cells was evaluated by the CYBERSORT algorithm and verified by immunohistochemistry. Results: LRP1B gene mutation was an independent risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in GC patients (HR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.28–5.14, p = 0.008). The Kaplan–Meier curve demonstrated a shorter survival time in high-risk patients stratified according to risk score (p < 0.0001). CYBERSORT analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly concentrated in CD4+ T cells and macrophages. TIMER analysis suggested that LRP1B expression was associated with the infiltration of CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LRP1B was expressed in the tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells in 16/89 and 26/89 of the cohort, respectively. LRP1B-positive TCs were associated with higher levels of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD86/CD163 (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that LRP1B-positive TCs represented an independent protective factor of DFS in GC patients (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.10–0.93, p = 0.042).

10.3389/fimmu.2023.1177847,Identification of novel gene signature for lung adenocarcinoma by machine learning to predict immunotherapy and prognosis,"Background Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) as a frequent type of lung cancer has a 5-year overall survival rate of lower than 20% among patients with advanced lung cancer. This study aims to construct a risk model to guide immunotherapy in LUAD patients effectively. Materials and methods LUAD Bulk RNA-seq data for the construction of a model, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (GSE203360) for cell cluster analysis, and microarray data (GSE31210) for validation were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We used the Seurat R package to filter and process scRNA-seq data. Sample clustering was performed in the ConsensusClusterPlus R package. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups were mined by the Limma R package. MCP-counter, CIBERSORT, ssGSEA, and ESTIMATE were employed to evaluate immune characteristics. Stepwise multivariate analysis, Univariate Cox analysis, and Lasso regression analysis were conducted to identify key prognostic genes and were used to construct the risk model. Key prognostic gene expressions were explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. Results A total of 27 immune cell marker genes associated with prognosis were identified for subtyping LUAD samples into clusters C3, C2, and C1. C1 had the longest overall survival and highest immune infiltration among them, followed by C2 and C3. Oncogenic pathways such as VEGF, EFGR, and MAPK were more activated in C3 compared to the other two clusters. Based on the DEGs among clusters, we confirmed seven key prognostic genes including CPA3, S100P, PTTG1, LOXL2, MELTF, PKP2, and TMPRSS11E. Two risk groups defined by the seven-gene risk model presented distinct responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, immune infiltration, and prognosis. The mRNA and protein level of CPA3 was decreased, while the remaining six gene levels were increased in clinical tumor tissues. Conclusion Immune cell markers are effective in clustering LUAD samples into different subtypes, and they play important roles in regulating the immune microenvironment and cancer development. In addition, the seven-gene risk model may serve as a guide for assisting in personalized treatment in LUAD patients.",2023,2023-07-31 00:00:00,12.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ab49eabfc27c82e118e73d4fb47456aced25de8
10.1186/s13045-023-01456-y,The artificial intelligence and machine learning in lung cancer immunotherapy,"Since the past decades, more lung cancer patients have been experiencing lasting benefits from immunotherapy. It is imperative to accurately and intelligently select appropriate patients for immunotherapy or predict the immunotherapy efficacy. In recent years, machine learning (ML)-based artificial intelligence (AI) was developed in the area of medical-industrial convergence. AI can help model and predict medical information. A growing number of studies have combined radiology, pathology, genomics, proteomics data in order to predict the expression levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer patients or predict the likelihood of immunotherapy benefits and side effects. Finally, with the advancement of AI and ML, it is believed that ""digital biopsy"" can replace the traditional single assessment method to benefit more cancer patients and help clinical decision-making in the future. In this review, the applications of AI in PD-L1/TMB prediction, TME prediction and lung cancer immunotherapy are discussed.",2023,2023-05-24 00:00:00,42.0,91.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ef278a4d2d1ea8d640440ee85a9ac4d5de3691f9
10.3389/fcell.2023.1060086,"Identification of lung adenocarcinoma subtypes and predictive signature for prognosis, immune features, and immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint genes","Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common variant of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) across the world. Recently, the rapid development of immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for LUAD patients. Closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment and immune cell functions, more and more new immune checkpoints have been discovered, and various cancer treatment studies targeting these novel immune checkpoints are currently in full swing. However, studies on the phenotype and clinical significance of novel immune checkpoints in LUAD are still limited, and only a minority of patients with LUAD can benefit from immunotherapy. Methods: The LUAD datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, and the immune checkpoints score of each sample were calculated based on the expression of the 82 immune checkpoints-related genes (ICGs). The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to obtain the gene modules closely related to the score and two different LUAD clusters were identified based on these module genes by the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) Algorithm. The differentially expressed genes between the two clusters were further used to construct a predictive signature for prognosis, immune features, and the response to immunotherapy for LUAD patients through a series of regression analyses. Results: A new immune checkpoints-related signature was finally established according to the expression of 7 genes (FCER2, CD200R1, RHOV, TNNT2, WT1, AHSG, and KRTAP5-8). This signature can stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with different survival outcomes and sensitivity to immunotherapy, and the signature has been well validated in different clinical subgroups and validation cohorts. Conclusion: We constructed a novel immune checkpoints-related LUAD risk assessment system, which has a good predictive ability and significance for guiding immunotherapy. We believe that these findings will not only aid in the clinical management of LUAD patients but also provide some insights into screening appropriate patients for immunotherapy.",2023,2023-05-10 00:00:00,6.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52693f3f9cc4abd1cc8ffb804d9b14db64e74619

10.1021/acscentsci.8b00357,Using Machine Learning To Predict Suitable Conditions for Organic Reactions,"Reaction condition recommendation is an essential element for the realization of computer-assisted synthetic planning. Accurate suggestions of reaction conditions are required for experimental validation and can have a significant effect on the success or failure of an attempted transformation. However, de novo condition recommendation remains a challenging and under-explored problem and relies heavily on chemists’ knowledge and experience. In this work, we develop a neural-network model to predict the chemical context (catalyst(s), solvent(s), reagent(s)), as well as the temperature most suitable for any particular organic reaction. Trained on ∼10 million examples from Reaxys, the model is able to propose conditions where a close match to the recorded catalyst, solvent, and reagent is found within the top-10 predictions 69.6% of the time, with top-10 accuracies for individual species reaching 80–90%. Temperature is accurately predicted within ±20 °C from the recorded temperature in 60–70% of test cases, with higher accuracy for cases with correct chemical context predictions. The utility of the model is illustrated through several examples spanning a range of common reaction classes. We also demonstrate that the model implicitly learns a continuous numerical embedding of solvent and reagent species that captures their functional similarity.",2018,2018-11-16 00:00:00,269.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb414c09ace7083c41c1164f5de4a901ddd8f146

We demonstrate that the properties of the generated molecules correlate very well with the properties of the molecules used to train the model. In order to enrich libraries with molecules active toward a given biological target, we propose to fine-tune the model with small sets of molecules, which are known to be active against that target. Against Staphylococcus aureus, the model reproduced 14% of 6051 hold-out test molecules that medicinal chemists designed, whereas against Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria), it reproduced 28% of 1240 test molecules.

10.2147/HMER.S74612,The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease,"Thrombocytopenia is the most common hematological abnormality encountered in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). In addition to being an indicator of advanced disease and poor prognosis, it frequently prevents crucial interventions. Historically, thrombocytopenia has been attributed to hypersplenism, which is the increased pooling of platelets in a spleen enlarged by congestive splenomegaly secondary to portal hypertension. Over the past decade, however, there have been significant advances in the understanding of thrombopoiesis, which, in turn, has led to an improved understanding of thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis. Multiple factors contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia and these can broadly be divided into those that cause decreased production, splenic sequestration, and increased destruction. Depressed thrombopoietin levels in CLD, together with direct bone marrow suppression, result in a reduced rate of platelet production. Thrombopoietin regulates both platelet production and maturation and is impaired in CLD. Bone marrow suppression can be caused by viruses, alcohol, iron overload, and medications. Splenic sequestration results from hypersplenism. The increased rate of platelet destruction in cirrhosis also occurs through a number of pathways: increased shear stress, increased fibrinolysis, bacterial translocation, and infection result in an increased rate of platelet aggregation, while autoimmune disease and raised titers of antiplatelet immunoglobulin result in the immunologic destruction of platelets. An in-depth understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the thrombocytopenia of CLD is crucial when considering treatment strategies. This review outlines the recent advances in our understanding of thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis and CLD.",2016,2016-04-15 00:00:00,191.0,135.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24f33ee8baef7632fcfbd951453cdca761bc6a47

When reporting overall CS rates, Blacks and other minorities are typically reported to have high CS rates but comparing overall CS rates may be misleading as CS may be more common in some higher risk populations. Improved understanding of how CS rates differ by race among standardized groups could highlight differences in care and areas for improvement. The current study examines racial differences in cesarean section delivery rates using the Robson Ten-Group Classification System in a nationwide sample. Data from US vital statistics live birth certificates were used to identify 3,906,088 births which were each classified into one of the ten groups based on five obstetric characteristics identifiable on presentation for delivery including parity, onset of labor, gestational age, fetal presentation, and number of fetuses. Results indicated that Black and Asian mothers had the highest CS rates in groups 1–4 which all contain single, cephalic pregnancies at term with no prior CS and are only differentiated by parity and onset of labor. Black mothers also had the lowest CS rates for groups 6 and 7, containing women with nulliparous and multiparous breech births. Black and Asian mothers show differences in CS rates among groups that could indicate lack of appropriate care. Efforts should be made to prevent unnecessary primary CS among low-risk mothers.",2020,2020-08-17 00:00:00,45.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d25360e3f7dbe023480108a9132b1235a20a102e

10.1007/s00330-020-07480-7,Smart chest X-ray worklist prioritization using artificial intelligence: a clinical workflow simulation,"The aim is to evaluate whether smart worklist prioritization by artificial intelligence (AI) can optimize the radiology workflow and reduce report turnaround times (RTATs) for critical findings in chest radiographs (CXRs). Furthermore, we investigate a method to counteract the effect of false negative predictions by AI—resulting in an extremely and dangerously long RTAT, as CXRs are sorted to the end of the worklist. We developed a simulation framework that models the current workflow at a university hospital by incorporating hospital-specific CXR generation rates and reporting rates and pathology distribution. Using this, we simulated the standard worklist processing “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) and compared it with a worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was performed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass, and foreign object. Furthermore, we introduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest urgency is assigned to the examination. The average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all prioritization simulations compared to the FIFO simulation (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6 min vs. 80.1 min; p < 0.0001), while the maximum RTAT for most findings increased at the same time (e.g., pneumothorax: 1293 min vs 890 min; p < 0.0001). Our “upper limit” substantially reduced the maximum RTAT in all classes (e.g., pneumothorax: 979 min vs. 1293 min/1178 min; p < 0.0001). Our simulations demonstrate that smart worklist prioritization by AI can reduce the average RTAT for critical findings in CXRs while maintaining a small maximum RTAT as FIFO. • Development of a realistic clinical workflow simulator based on empirical data from a hospital allowed precise assessment of smart worklist prioritization using artificial intelligence. • Employing a smart worklist prioritization without a threshold for maximum waiting time runs the risk of false negative predictions of the artificial intelligence greatly increasing the report turnaround time. • Use of a state-of-the-art convolution neural network can reduce the average report turnaround time almost to the upper limit of a perfect classification algorithm (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6 min vs. 30.4 min).",2020,2020-01-23 00:00:00,49.0,20.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f28a3bfaba09c6483eab261615cf7ba5b4f67250
10.1186/s12978-019-0832-4,Development of caesarean section prediction models: secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study in two sub-Saharan African countries,"BackgroundCaesarean section is recommended in situations in which vaginal birth presents a greater likelihood of adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes than normal. However, it is associated with a higher risk of complications, especially when performed without a clear medical indication. Since labour attendants have no standardised clinical method to assist in this decision, statistical tools developed based on multiple labour variables may be an alternative. The objective of this paper was to develop and evaluate the accuracy of models for caesarean section prediction using maternal and foetal characteristics collected at admission and through labour.MethodThis is a secondary analysis of the World Health Organization’s Better Outcomes in Labour Difficulty prospective cohort study in two sub-Saharan African countries. Data were collected from women admitted for labour and childbirth in 13 hospitals in Nigeria as well as Uganda between 2014 and 2015. We applied logistic regression to develop different models to predict caesarean section, based on the time when intrapartum assessment was made. To evaluate discriminatory capacity of the various models, we calculated: area under the curve, diagnostic accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity.ResultsA total of 8957 pregnant women with 12.67% of caesarean births were used for model development. The model based on labour admission characteristics showed an area under the curve of 78.70%, sensitivity of 63.20%, specificity of 78.68% and accuracy of 76.62%. On the other hand, the models that applied intrapartum assessments performed better, with an area under the curve of 93.66%, sensitivity of 80.12%, specificity of 89.26% and accuracy of 88.03%.ConclusionIt is possible to predict the likelihood of intrapartum caesarean section with high accuracy based on labour characteristics and events. However, the accuracy of this prediction is considerably higher when based on information obtained throughout the course of labour.",2019,2019-11-14 00:00:00,9.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed6e9684c5da0cf536019889ca9aa9a2905d5ba2
10.1371/journal.pone.0203550,"Trends in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white cesarean delivery rates on the US-Mexico border, 2000-2015","Background Cesarean delivery occurs in one in three US births and poses risks for mothers and infants. Hispanic cesarean rates were higher than non-Hispanic white rates in the US in 2016. In 2009, cesarean rates among Hispanics on the US-Mexico border exceeded rates among US Hispanics. Since 2009, rates have declined nationwide, but border Hispanic rates have not been studied. Objective To compare cesarean delivery rates and trends in Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in border and nonborder counties of the four US border states before and after 2009. Study Design We used data from birth certificates to calculate percentages of cesarean deliveries among all births and births to low-risk nulliparous women during 2000–2015, and among births to low-risk women with and without a previous cesarean during 2009–2015. We calculated 95% confidence intervals around rates and used regular and piecewise linear regression to estimate trends for four ethnic-geographic subpopulations defined by combinations of Hispanic ethnicity and border-nonborder status. Results Of the four subpopulations, border Hispanic rates were highest every year for all cesarean outcomes. In 2015 they were 38.3% overall, 31.4% among low-risk nulliparous women, and 21.1% and 94.6% among low-risk women without and with a previous cesarean, respectively. Nonborder Hispanic rates in 2015 were lowest for all outcomes but repeat cesarean. Rates for all four subpopulations rose steadily during 2000–2009. Unlike rates for non-Hispanic whites, border and nonborder Hispanic rates did not decline post-2009. Most of the border Hispanic excess can be attributed to higher cesarean rates in Texas. Discussion Border Hispanic cesarean rates remain higher than those among other Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in border states and show no signs of declining. This continuing disparity warrants further analysis using individual as well as hospital, environmental and other contextual factors to help target prevention measures.",2018,2018-09-05 00:00:00,6.0,31.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e0d52cd14428cfba4b2be7e31eb127de13f73ed

Identification of these genes and understanding their functions are critical for further investigation of tumorigenesis. So far, many studies have identified numerous TSGs and illustrated their functions in various types of tumors or normal samples. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs can act as TSGs to prevent the tumorigenesis processes. Therefore, there is a growing demand to integrate TSGs with large-scale experimental evidence (e.g. gene expression and epigenetic signatures) to provide a comprehensive resource for further investigation of TSGs and their molecular mechanisms in cancer.

10.3390/en15124501,Application of Machine Learning for Lithofacies Prediction and Cluster Analysis Approach to Identify Rock Type,"Nowadays, there are significant issues in the classification of lithofacies and the identification of rock types in particular. Zamzama gas field demonstrates the complex nature of lithofacies due to the heterogeneous nature of the reservoir formation, while it is quite challenging to identify the lithofacies. Using our machine learning approach and cluster analysis, we can not only resolve these difficulties, but also minimize their time-consuming aspects and provide an accurate result even when the user is inexperienced. To constrain accurate reservoir models, rock type identification is a critical step in reservoir characterization. Many empirical and statistical methodologies have been established based on the effect of rock type on reservoir performance. Only well-logged data are provided, and no cores are sampled. Given these circumstances, and the fact that traditional methods such as regression are intractable, we have chosen to apply three strategies: (1) using a self-organizing map (SOM) to arrange depth intervals with similar facies into clusters; (2) clustering to split various facies into specific zones; and (3) the cluster analysis technique is used to identify rock type. In the Zamzama gas field, SOM and cluster analysis techniques discovered four group of facies, each of which was internally comparable in petrophysical properties but distinct from the others. Gamma Ray (GR), Effective Porosity(eff), Permeability (Perm) and Water Saturation (Sw) are used to generate these results. The findings and behavior of four facies shows that facies-01 and facies-02 have good characteristics for acting as gas-bearing sediments, whereas facies-03 and facies-04 are non-reservoir sediments. The outcomes of this study stated that facies-01 is an excellent rock-type zone in the reservoir of the Zamzama gas field.",2022,2022-06-20 00:00:00,33.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1338513b74f201e73971af7559e19e0ea1d1512

10.2166/nh.2020.025,Improving hydropower inflow forecasts by assimilating snow data,"
 Accurate long-term inflow forecasts are essential for optimal planning of hydropower production. In snow-rich regions, where spring snowmelt is often the largest reservoir of water, inflow forecasts may be improved by assimilating snow observations to achieve more accurate initial states for the hydrological models prior to the prognosis. In this study, we test whether an ensemble Kalman based approach is useful for this purpose for a mountainous catchment in Norway. For 15 years, annual snow observations near peak accumulation at three locations were assimilated into a distributed hydrological model. After the update, the model was run for a 4-month forecasting period with inflows compared to a base case scenario that omitted the snow observations. The assimilation framework improved the forecasts in several years, and in two of the years, the improvement was very large compared to the base case simulation. At the same time, the filter did not degrade the forecasts largely, indicating that though the updating might slightly degrade performance in some years, it maintains the potential for large improvements in others. Thus, the framework proposed here is a viable method for improving snow-related deficiencies in the initial states, which translates to better forecasts.",2020,2020-03-17 00:00:00,26.0,38.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a9655bc8b21b0d752dc2c0ece20b4f61014b022

10.3390/su11195375,Low Carbon Scheduling Optimization of Flexible Integrated Energy System Considering CVaR and Energy Efficiency,"With the rapid transformation of energy structures, the Integrated Energy System (IES) has developed rapidly. It can meet the complementary needs of various energy sources such as cold, thermal, and electricity in industrial parks; can realize multi-energy complements and centralized energy supplies; and can further improve the use efficiency of energy. However, with the extensive access of renewable energy, the uncertainty and intermittentness of renewable energy power generation will greatly reduce the use efficiency of renewable energy and the supply flexibility of IES so as to increase the operational risk of the system operator. With the goal of minimum sum of the system-operating cost and the carbon-emission penalty cost, this paper analyzes the combined supply of cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) influence on system efficiency, compared with the traditional IES. The flexible modified IES realizes the decoupling of cooling, thermal, and electricity; enhances the flexibility of the IES in a variety of energy supply; at the same time, improves the use efficiency of multi-energy; and reasonably avoids the occurrence of energy loss and resource waste. With the aim of reducing the risk that the access of renewable energy may bring to the IES, this paper introduces the fuzzy c-mean-clustering comprehensive quality (FCM-CCQ) algorithm, which is a novel method superior to the general clustering method and performs cluster analysis on the output scenarios of wind power and photovoltaic. Meanwhile, conditional value at risk (CVaR) theory is added to control the system operation risk, which is rarely applied in the field of IES optimization. The model is simulated in a numerical example, and the results demonstrate that the availability and applicability of the presented model are verified. In addition, the carbon dioxide emission of the traditional operation mode; thermoelectric decoupling operation mode; and cooling, thermal, and electricity decoupling operation mode of the IES decrease successively. The system flexibility is greatly enhanced, and the energy-use rate of the system is improved as a whole. Finally, IES, after its flexible transformation, significantly achieve energy conservation, emission reduction, and environmental protection.",2019,2019-09-28 00:00:00,13.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a04e436d2c0f7cf063c8805595b1060faa64e5a1

10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20555,"Federated Dynamic Sparse Training: Computing Less, Communicating Less, Yet Learning Better","Federated learning (FL) enables distribution of machine learning workloads from the cloud to resource-limited edge devices. Unfortunately, current deep networks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge devices, but also too large for communicating updates over bandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and experimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse Training (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained with substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and in-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that extracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this scheme, ""two birds are killed with one stone:'' instead of full models, each client performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse networks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly accommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse masks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an ""in-time self-ensembling effect'' into the training dynamics, and improves the FL performance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d. FL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our experiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it gains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same upload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2 times the upload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

10.3390/a13030072,Energy Efficient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Comprehensive Survey,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are among the most emerging technologies, thanks to their great capabilities and their ever growing range of applications. However, the lifetime of WSNs is extremely restricted due to the delimited energy capacity of their sensor nodes. This is why energy conservation is considered as the most important research concern for WSNs. Radio communication is the utmost energy consuming function in a WSN. Thus, energy efficient routing is necessitated to save energy and thus prolong the lifetime of WSNs. For this reason, numerous protocols for energy efficient routing in WSNs have been proposed. This article offers an analytical and up to date survey on the protocols of this kind. The classic and modern protocols presented are categorized, depending on i) how the network is structured, ii) how data are exchanged, iii) whether location information is or not used, and iv) whether Quality of Service (QoS) or multiple paths are or not supported. In each distinct category, protocols are both described and compared in terms of specific performance metrics, while their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.

10.7150/jca.96744,Causal relationship between immune cells and hepatocellular carcinoma: a Mendelian randomisation study,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predominant malignancy of the digestive tract, ranks as the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality globally, significantly impeding human health and lifespan. Emerging immunotherapeutic approaches have ignited fresh optimism for patient outcomes. This investigation probes the link between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC through Mendelian Randomization and single-cell sequencing, aiming to unearth viable drug targets and dissect HCC's etiology. Methods: We conducted an exhaustive two-sample Mendelian Randomization analysis to ascertain the causal links between immune cell features and HCC, utilizing publicly accessible genetic datasets to explore the causal connections of 731 immune cell traits with HCC susceptibility. The integrity, diversity, and potential horizontal pleiotropy of these findings were rigorously assessed through extensive sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing was employed to penetrate the pathogenic underpinnings of HCC. Results: Establishing a significance threshold of pval_Inverse.variance.weighted at 0.05, our study pinpointed five immune characteristics potentially elevating HCC risk: B cell % CD3- lymphocyte (TBNK panel), CD25 on IgD+ (B cell panel), HVEM on TD CD4+ (Maturation stages of T cell panel), CD14 on CD14+ CD16- monocyte (Monocyte panel), CD4 on CD39+ activated Treg ( Treg panel). Conversely, various cellular phenotypes tied to BAFF-R expression emerged as protective elements. Single-cell sequencing unveiled profound immune cell phenotype interactions, highlighting marked disparities in cell communication and metabolic activities. Conclusion: Leveraging MR and scRNA-seq techniques, our study elucidates potential associations between 731 immune cell phenotypes and HCC, offering a window into the molecular interplays among cellular phenotypes, and addressing the limitations of mono-antibody therapeutic targets.",2024,2024-06-03 00:00:00,12.0,66.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58dc6f8c942361560fa67583eb2d852e433b8402

Nevertheless, its specific role in the context of gastric cancer (GC) remains uncertain. Methods: In this study, we integrated multi-omics algorithms to investigate the molecular characteristics of parthanatos in GC. A series of bioinformatics algorithms were utilized to explore clinical heterogeneity of GC and further predict the clinical outcomes. Results: Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the omics features of parthanatos in various human tumors, including genomic mutations, transcriptome expression, and prognostic relevance. We successfully identified 7 cell types within the GC microenvironment: myeloid cell, epithelial cell, T cell, stromal cell, proliferative cell, B cell, and NK cell. When compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, single-cell sequencing results from GC tissues revealed elevated scores for the parthanatos pathway across multiple cell types. Spatial transcriptomics, for the first time, unveiled the spatial distribution characteristics of parthanatos signaling. GC patients with different parthanatos signals often exhibited distinct immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming features, leading to different clinical outcomes. The integration of parthanatos signaling and clinical indicators enabled the creation of novel survival curves that accurately assess patients’ survival times and statuses. Conclusions: In this study, the molecular characteristics of parthanatos’ unicellular and spatial transcriptomics in GC were revealed for the first time.

10.18632/aging.205639,Molecular characteristics and prognostic significances of lysosomal-dependent cell death in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma,"Lysosomal-dependent cell death (LDCD) has an excellent therapeutic effect on apoptosis-resistant and drug-resistant tumors; however, the important role of LDCD-related genes (LDCD-RGs) in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) has not been reported. Initially, single-cell atlas of LDCD signal in KIRC was comprehensively depicted. We also emphasized the molecular characteristics of LDCD-RGs in various human neoplasms. Predicated upon the expressive quotients of LDCD-RGs, we stratified KIRC patients into tripartite cohorts denoted as C1, C2, and C3. Those allocated to the ambit of C1 evinced the most sanguine prognosis within the KIRC cohort, underscored by the acme of LDCD-RGs scores. This further confirms the significant role that LDCD-RGs play in both the pathophysiological foundation and clinical implications of KIRC. In culmination, by virtue of employing the LASSO-Cox analytical modality, we have ushered in an innovative and avant-garde prognostic framework tailored for KIRC, predicated on the bedrock of LDCD-RGs. The assemblage of KIRC instances was arbitrarily apportioned into constituents inclusive of a didactic cohort, an internally wielded validation cadre, and an externally administered validation cohort. Concurrently, patients were dichotomized into strata connoting elevated jeopardy synonymous with adverse prognostic trajectories, and conversely, diminished risk tantamount to favorable prognoses, contingent on the calibrated expressions of LDCD-RGs. Succinctly, our investigative findings serve to underscore the cardinal capacity harbored by LDCD-RGs within the KIRC milieu, concurrently birthing a pioneering prognostic schema intrinsically linked to the trajectory of KIRC and its attendant prognoses.",2024,2024-03-07 00:00:00,2.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72b7d73bc84580cfdafaeb08b2cdc62e7c6e8a64
10.18632/aging.205436,Combination of bulk RNA sequencing and scRNA sequencing uncover the molecular characteristics of MAPK signaling in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma,"The MAPK signaling pathway significantly impacts cancer progression and resistance; however, its functions remain incompletely assessed across various cancers, particularly in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive pan-cancer investigations of MAPK signaling, particularly within the context of KIRC. In this research, we obtained TCGA pan-cancer multi-omics data and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the MAPK signaling pathway. For in-depth investigation in KIRC, status of MAPK pathway was quantitatively estimated by ssGSEA and Ward algorithm was utilized for cluster analysis. Molecular characteristics and clinical prognoses of KIRC patients with distinct MAPK activities were comprehensively explored using a series of bioinformatics algorithms. Subsequently, a combination of LASSO and COX regression analyses were utilized sequentially to construct a MAPK-related signature to help identify the risk level of each sample. Patients in the C1 subtype exhibited relatively higher levels of MAPK signaling activity, which were associated with abundant immune cell infiltration and favorable clinical outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of KIRC samples identified seven distinct cell types, and endothelial cells in tumor tissues had obviously higher MAPK scores than normal tissues. The immunohistochemistry results indicated the reduced expression levels of PAPSS1, MAP3K11, and SPRED1 in KIRC samples. In conclusion, our study represents the first integration of bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing to elucidate the molecular characteristics of MAPK signaling in KIRC, providing a solid foundation for precision oncology.",2024,2024-01-12 00:00:00,9.0,67.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a5bafab0e2691595bb49c7cf05fed766bbe8c19
10.18632/aging.205364,The potential value of the Purinergic pathway in the prognostic assessment and clinical application of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma,"The Purinergic pathway is involved in a variety of important physiological processes in living organisms, and previous studies have shown that aberrant expression of the Purinergic pathway may contribute to the development of a variety of cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). The aim of this study was to delve into the Purinergic pathway in KIRC and to investigate its potential significance in prognostic assessment and clinical treatment. 33 genes associated with the Purinergic pathway were selected for pan-cancer analysis. Cluster analysis, targeted drug sensitivity analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were applied to explore the mechanism of Purinergic pathway in KIRC. Using the machine learning process, we found that combining the Lasso+survivalSVM algorithm worked well for predicting survival accuracy in KIRC. We used LASSO regression to pinpoint nine Purinergic genes closely linked to KIRC, using them to create a survival model for KIRC. ROC survival curve was analyzed, and this survival model could effectively predict the survival rate of KIRC patients in the next 5, 7 and 10 years. Further univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that age, grading, staging, and risk scores of KIRC patients were significantly associated with their prognostic survival and were identified as independent risk factors for prognosis. The nomogram tool developed through this study can help physicians accurately assess patient prognosis and provide guidance for developing treatment plans. The results of this study may bring new ideas for optimizing the prognostic assessment and therapeutic approaches for KIRC patients.",2024,2024-01-04 00:00:00,2.0,91.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fd128b163172e53f3a0b59afdc87a65e1137770a
10.18632/aging.205129,Role of NF-κB pathway in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and its potential therapeutic implications,"Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), a common malignant tumor of the urinary system, is the most aggressive renal tumor subtype. Since the discovery of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in 1986, many studies have demonstrated abnormal NF-κB signaling is associated with the development of various cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. In this study, the relationship between NF-κB and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma was confirmed using bioinformatics analysis. First, we explored the differential expression of copy number variation (CNV), single nucleotide variant (SNV), and messenger RNA (mRNA) in NF-κB-related genes in different types of cancer, as well as the impact on cancer prognosis and sensitivity to common chemotherapy drugs. Then, we divided the mRNA expression levels of NF-κB-related genes in KIRC patients into three groups through GSVA cluster analysis and explored the correlation between the NF-κB pathway and clinical data of KIRC patients, classical cancer-related genes, common anticancer drug responsiveness, and immune cell infiltration. Finally, 11 tumor-related genes were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct a prognostic model. In addition, we used the UALCAN and HPA databases to verify the protein levels of three key NF-κB-related genes (CHUK, IKGGB, and IKBKG) in KIRC. In conclusion, our study established a prognostic survival model based on NF-κB-related genes, which can be used to predict the prognosis of patients with KIRC.",2023,2023-10-16 00:00:00,7.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/152721bc261d1cfd7d8fa8ab8328ba691b48ac91
10.1186/s13073-023-01218-y,Spatial transcriptomics analysis of neoadjuvant cabozantinib and nivolumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma identifies independent mechanisms of resistance and recurrence,"Background Novel immunotherapy combination therapies have improved outcomes for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but responses are limited to a subset of patients. Little is known about the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in cellular signaling networks within the HCC tumor microenvironment (TME) that underlie responses to modern systemic therapy. Methods We applied spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling to characterize the tumor microenvironment in HCC resection specimens from a prospective clinical trial of neoadjuvant cabozantinib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that primarily blocks VEGF, and nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor in which 5 out of 15 patients were found to have a pathologic response at the time of resection. Results ST profiling demonstrated that the TME of responding tumors was enriched for immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) with pro-inflammatory signaling relative to the non-responders. The enriched cancer-immune interactions in responding tumors are characterized by activation of the PAX5 module, a known regulator of B cell maturation, which colocalized with spots with increased B cell marker expression suggesting strong activity of these cells. HCC-CAF interactions were also enriched in the responding tumors and were associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as there was high activation of FOS and JUN in CAFs adjacent to the tumor. The ECM remodeling is consistent with proliferative fibrosis in association with immune-mediated tumor regression. Among the patients with major pathologic responses, a single patient experienced early HCC recurrence. ST analysis of this clinical outlier demonstrated marked tumor heterogeneity, with a distinctive immune-poor tumor region that resembles the non-responding TME across patients and was characterized by HCC-CAF interactions and expression of cancer stem cell markers, potentially mediating early tumor immune escape and recurrence in this patient. Conclusions These data show that responses to modern systemic therapy in HCC are associated with distinctive molecular and cellular landscapes and provide new targets to enhance and prolong responses to systemic therapy in HCC.",2023,2023-09-18 00:00:00,37.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ac79c0c65ef2ef02b04b43e256c04c44d97b728

Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional study design, typically used in measurement-related studies. A sample of 167 children, ages 5–11 years (mean ± SD: 8.0 ± 1.8 years), performed up to eight seated sedentary activities while wearing accelerometers on both wrists. Activities included: reading books, sorting cards, cutting and pasting, playing board games, eating snacks, playing with tablets, watching TV, and writing. Direct observation verified sedentary behavior from light activity. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to determine optimal cut-point thresholds. Quantile regression models estimated differences between dominant and non-dominant placement. Results: The optimal cut-point threshold for the non-dominant wrist was 203 counts/5 s with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 71.56, 70.83, and 0.72, respectively. A 10-fold cross-validation revealed an average AUC of 0.70. Statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences in median counts ranging from 7 to 46 counts/5 s were found between dominant and non-dominant placement in five out of eight sedentary activities, with the dominant wrist eliciting higher counts/5 s. Conclusion: Results from this study support the recommendation to place accelerometers on the non-dominant wrist to minimize “noise” during seated sedentary behaviors.",2018,2018-09-26 00:00:00,10.0,21.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/98d03a27d7dd6b1894c55f43881b8b07de0cf41d

Toddlers’ screen time and personal attributes, physical activity- or screen time-specific parental cognitions and behaviors, and the home and neighborhood environment were measured via parental-report using the PREPS questionnaire. Accelerometry-measured physical activity was available in 123 toddlers. Bayesian estimation in structural equation modeling (SEM) using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was performed to test an SMCB hypothesized model. Covariates included toddlers’ age, sex, race/ethnicity, main type of childcare, and family household income.ResultsIn the SMCB hypothesized screen time model, higher parental barrier self-efficacy for limiting toddlers’ screen time was associated with higher parental screen time limiting practices (β = 0.451), while higher parental negative outcome expectations for limiting toddlers’ screen time was associated with lower parental screen time limiting practices (β = − 0.147). In turn, higher parental screen time limiting practices was associated with lower screen time among toddlers (β = − 0.179). Parental modeling of higher screen time was associated with higher screen time among toddlers directly (β = 0.212) and indirectly through the home environment. Specifically, higher screen time among parents was associated with having at least one electronic device in toddlers’ bedrooms (β = 0.146) and, in turn, having electronics in the bedroom, compared to none, was associated with higher screen time among toddlers (β = 0.250). Neighborhood safety was not associated with toddlers’ screen time in the SEM analysis. No significant correlations were observed between the SMCB variables and toddlers’ physical activity; thus, no further analyses were performed for physical activity.ConclusionsParents and their interactions with the home environment may play an important role in shaping toddlers’ screen time. Findings can inform family-based interventions aiming to minimize toddlers’ screen time.

10.1186/s12889-016-3569-9,Toddler physical activity study: laboratory and community studies to evaluate accelerometer validity and correlates,"BackgroundToddlerhood is an important age for physical activity (PA) promotion to prevent obesity and support a physically active lifestyle throughout childhood. Accurate assessment of PA is needed to determine trends/correlates of PA, time spent in sedentary, light, or moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA), and the effectiveness of PA promotion programs. Due to the limited availability of objective measures that have been validated and evaluated for feasibility in community studies, it is unclear which subgroups of toddlers are at the highest risk for inactivity. Using Actical ankle accelerometry, the objectives of this study are to develop valid thresholds, examine feasibility, and examine demographic/ anthropometric PA correlates of MVPA among toddlers from low-income families.MethodsTwo studies were conducted with toddlers (12–36 months). Laboratory Study (n = 24)- Two Actical accelerometers were placed on the ankle. PA was observed using the Child Activity Rating Scale (CARS, prescribed activities). Analyses included device equivalence reliability (correlation: activity counts of two Acticals), criterion-related validity (correlation: activity counts and CARS ratings), and sensitivity/specificity for thresholds. Community Study (n = 277, low-income mother-toddler dyads recruited)- An Actical was worn on the ankle for > 7 days (goal >5, 24-h days). Height/weight was measured. Mothers reported demographics. Analyses included frequencies (feasibility) and stepwise multiple linear regression (sMLR).ResultsLaboratory Study- Acticals demonstrated reliability (r = 0.980) and validity (r = 0.75). Thresholds demonstrated sensitivity (86 %) and specificity (88 %). Community Study- 86 % wore accelerometer, 69 % had valid data (mean = 5.2 days). Primary reasons for missing/invalid data: refusal (14 %) and wear-time ≤2 days (11 %). The MVPA threshold (>2200 cpm) yielded 54 min/day. In sMLR, MVPA was associated with age (older > younger, β = 32.8, p < 0.001), gender (boys > girls, β = −11.21, p = 0.032), maternal MVPA (β = 0.44, p = 0.002) and recruitment location (suburban > urban, β = 19.6, p < 0.001), or race (non-Black > Black, β = 18.5, p = 0.001). No association with toddler weight status.ConclusionsAnkle accelerometry is a valid, reliable, and feasible method of assessing PA in community studies of toddlers from low-income families. Sub-populations of toddlers may be at increased risk for inactivity, including toddlers that are younger, female, Black, those with less active mothers, and those living in an urban location.",2016,2016-09-06 00:00:00,45.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3dfdbd985aac34aa299e59a85683672b7c93b7f

10.1371/journal.pone.0279604,A deep graph convolutional neural network architecture for graph classification,"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful deep learning methods for non-Euclidean structure data and achieve impressive performance in many fields. But most of the state-of-the-art GCN models are shallow structures with depths of no more than 3 to 4 layers, which greatly limits the ability of GCN models to extract high-level features of nodes. There are two main reasons for this: 1) Overlaying too many graph convolution layers will lead to the problem of over-smoothing. 2) Graph convolution is a kind of localized filter, which is easily affected by local properties. To solve the above problems, we first propose a novel general framework for graph neural networks called Non-local Message Passing (NLMP). Under this framework, very deep graph convolutional networks can be flexibly designed, and the over-smoothing phenomenon can be suppressed very effectively. Second, we propose a new spatial graph convolution layer to extract node multiscale high-level node features. Finally, we design an end-to-end Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network II (DGCNNII) model for graph classification task, which is up to 32 layers deep. And the effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by quantifying the graph smoothness of each layer and ablation studies. Experiments on benchmark graph classification datasets show that DGCNNII outperforms a large number of shallow graph neural network baseline methods.",2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,18.0,77.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c582bdbd4787c2f81c999de76445e440a600d835

10.3389/fgene.2021.690049,Graph Neural Networks and Their Current Applications in Bioinformatics,"Graph neural networks (GNNs), as a branch of deep learning in non-Euclidean space, perform particularly well in various tasks that process graph structure data. With the rapid accumulation of biological network data, GNNs have also become an important tool in bioinformatics. In this research, a systematic survey of GNNs and their advances in bioinformatics is presented from multiple perspectives. We first introduce some commonly used GNN models and their basic principles. Then, three representative tasks are proposed based on the three levels of structural information that can be learned by GNNs: node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. Meanwhile, according to the specific applications for various omics data, we categorize and discuss the related studies in three aspects: disease prediction, drug discovery, and biomedical imaging. Based on the analysis, we provide an outlook on the shortcomings of current studies and point out their developing prospect. Although GNNs have achieved excellent results in many biological tasks at present, they still face challenges in terms of low-quality data processing, methodology, and interpretability and have a long road ahead.

Usually, not all columns show important values. As a result, the machine learning models may perform poorly since the noise or unnecessary columns may confound the algorithms. To address this issue, various feature selection methods have been developed to evaluate large dimensional datasets and identify their subsets of pertinent features. The data, however, frequently skews feature selection algorithms. As a result, ensemble approaches have emerged as a substitute that incorporates the benefits of single feature selection algorithms and makes up for their drawbacks. In order to handle feature selection on datasets with large dimensionality, this research aims to grasp the key ideas and links in the process of aggregating feature selection methods. The suggested idea is tested by creating a cross-validation implementation that combines a number of Python packages with functionality to enable the feature selection techniques. By identifying pertinent features in the human, chimpanzee, and dog DNA datasets, the performance of the implementation was demonstrated.",2022,2022-12-29 00:00:00,5.0,15.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c6892d5fbc88c3af2ac052a01cbcd45c7359837

10.1038/s41598-021-93651-5,Impact of train/test sample regimen on performance estimate stability of machine learning in cardiovascular imaging,"As machine learning research in the field of cardiovascular imaging continues to grow, obtaining reliable model performance estimates is critical to develop reliable baselines and compare different algorithms. While the machine learning community has generally accepted methods such as k-fold stratified cross-validation (CV) to be more rigorous than single split validation, the standard research practice in medical fields is the use of single split validation techniques. This is especially concerning given the relatively small sample sizes of datasets used for cardiovascular imaging. We aim to examine how train-test split variation impacts the stability of machine learning (ML) model performance estimates in several validation techniques on two real-world cardiovascular imaging datasets: stratified split-sample validation (70/30 and 50/50 train-test splits), tenfold stratified CV, 10 × repeated tenfold stratified CV, bootstrapping (500 × repeated), and leave one out (LOO) validation. We demonstrate that split validation methods lead to the highest range in AUC and statistically significant differences in ROC curves, unlike the other aforementioned approaches. When building predictive models on relatively small data sets as is often the case in medical imaging, split-sample validation techniques can produce instability in performance estimates with variations in range over 0.15 in the AUC values, and thus any of the alternate validation methods are recommended.",2021,2021-07-14 00:00:00,44.0,18.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b21887521cad865e8d550e9f671c88baaa7d299

However, the size of the datasets and the train/test split ratios can greatly affect the outcome of the models, and thus the classification performance itself. We compared several combinations of dataset sizes and split ratios with five different machine learning algorithms to find the differences or similarities and to select the best parameter settings in nonbinary (multiclass) classification. It is also known that the models are ranked differently according to the performance merit(s) used. Here, 25 performance parameters were calculated for each model, then factorial ANOVA was applied to compare the results. The results clearly show the differences not just between the applied machine learning algorithms but also between the dataset sizes and to a lesser extent the train/test split ratios. The XGBoost algorithm could outperform the others, even in multiclass modeling. The performance parameters reacted differently to the change of the sample set size; some of them were much more sensitive to this factor than the others. Moreover, significant differences could be detected between train/test split ratios as well, exerting a great effect on the test validation of our models.",2021,2021-02-01 00:00:00,188.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d92ea77acd00714dffde87630d6af8c72a03e8e

With these data, defect prediction software can try to estimate the defect proneness of a software module, with the objective of assisting and guiding software practitioners. With timely and accurate defect predictions, practitioners can focus their limited testing resources on higher risk areas. This paper reports the results of three empirical studies that uses an automated genetic defect prediction framework. This framework generates and compares different learning schemes (preprocessing + attribute selection + learning algorithms) and selects the best one using a genetic algorithm, with the objective to estimate the defect proneness of a software module. The first empirical study is a performance comparison of our framework with the most important framework of the literature. The second empirical study is a performance and runtime comparison between our framework and an exhaustive framework. The third empirical study is a sensitivity analysis. The last empirical study, is our main contribution in this paper. Performance of the software development defect prediction models (using AUC, Area Under the Curve) was validated using NASA-MDP and PROMISE data sets. Seventeen data sets from NASA-MDP (13) and PROMISE (4) projects were analyzed running a NxM-fold cross-validation. A genetic algorithm was used to select the components of the learning schemes automatically, and to assess and report the results. Our results reported similar performance between frameworks.

Despite its potential to transform current pedagogies and learning experiences through engaging, interactive, and fascinating educational techniques, research is limited in exploring its application, usability, and user experience, particularly for Thai undergraduate students in learning computer engineering courses. In response, we designed and developed an innovative metaverse-based learning system called the AIIS collaborative learning interface, tailored to European undergraduate students. While the original intent of AIIS was to cater to medical students, in this study, our objective was to assess its usability and applicability for computer science and engineering students, specifically focusing on the Asian demographic. After an initial pilot with European students in their local context, the research was extended to Thailand, where 21 Thai undergraduate students evaluated the platform’s usability. The observations from this study indicate that AIIS provides a dynamic, user-friendly learning environment. Nevertheless, the evaluation process unveiled some usability flaws that offer informative directions for future enhancements. Drawing from our observations, we formulated usability guidelines to guide designers and developers toward crafting more efficient metaverse systems, particularly those intended for educational use.

Due to this problem, the present investigation has been focused on studying how time management is linked to academic stress in university students. This research study of a basic/substantive non-experimental type and correlational level has been developed under a quantitative approach with a cross section. The sample consisted of 328 students of both genders, selected from a public university in the city of Lima. Two standardized tools were adapted for data collection. Two questionnaires were also applied: time management and academic stress. The results showed that there was an inverse correlation between time management and academic stress (Spearman's Rho = .413), as well as for the dimensions of academic stress: stressors (- .405), symptoms (-, 387) and coping (, 286).

Developing reconfigurable fiber-based memristors is an efficient method to realize electronic textiles that capable of neuromorphic computing function. However, the previously reported artificial synapse and neuron need different materials and configurations, making it difficult to realize multiple functions in a single device. Herein, a textile memristor network of Ag/MoS2/HfAlOx/carbon nanotube with reconfigurable characteristics was reported, which can achieve both nonvolatile synaptic plasticity and volatile neuron functions. In addition, a single reconfigurable memristor can realize integrate-and-fire function, exhibiting significant advantages in reducing the complexity of neuron circuits. The firing energy consumption of fiber-based memristive neuron is 1.9 fJ/spike (femtojoule-level), which is at least three orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported biological and artificial neuron (picojoule-level). The ultralow energy consumption makes it possible to create an electronic neural network that reduces the energy consumption compared to human brain. By integrating the reconfigurable synapse, neuron and heating resistor, a smart textile system is successfully constructed for warm fabric application, providing a unique functional reconfiguration pathway toward the next-generation in-memory computing textile system. Neuromorphic computing memristors are attractive to construct low-power- consumption electronic textiles.

However, such interstitial doping inevitably leads to lattice microstrain that impairs the long-range ordering and stability of the crystals, causing a sacrificial trade-off. Here, we unravel the evident influence of the valence states of the interstitial cations on their efficacy to suppress the ion migration. Incorporation of a trivalent neodymium cation (Nd3+) effectively mitigates the ion migration in the perovskite lattice with a reduced dosage (0.08%) compared to a widely used monovalent cation dopant (Na+, 0.45%). The photovoltaic performances and operational stability of the prototypical perovskite solar cells are enhanced with a trace amount of Nd3+ doping while minimizing the sacrificial trade-off. Ion migration has a detrimental effect on the performance and stability of halide perovskite optoelectronics. Here, the authors incorporated a small dosage of high-valence neodymium cation to suppress this, with a minimal impact on the lattice microstrain.",2022,2022-11-17 00:00:00,128.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed2109f8e9a5f72d512fc95f6d2e7d286c73ee18

In general, vast amounts of data are collected from various sensors in an IIoT environment, and they are analyzed to prevent failures by predicting their occurrence. However, the collected data may include data irrelevant to failures and thereby decrease the prediction accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a failure prediction model using iterative feature selection. To build the model, the relevancy between each feature (i.e., each sensor) and the failure was analyzed using the random forest algorithm, to obtain the importance of the features. Then, feature selection and model building were conducted iteratively. In each iteration, a new feature was selected considering the importance and added to the selected feature set. The failure prediction model was built for each iteration via the support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the failure prediction model having the highest prediction accuracy was selected.

10.1002/anie.202104436,"1,1,2‐Ethenetriol: The Enol of Glycolic Acid, a High‐Energy Prebiotic Molecule","Abstract As low‐temperature conditions (e.g. in space) prohibit reactions requiring large activation energies, an alternative mechanism for follow‐up transformations of highly stable molecules involves the reactions of higher energy isomers that were generated in a different environment. Hence, one working model for the formation of larger organic molecules is their generation from high‐lying isomers of otherwise rather stable molecules. As an example, we present here the synthesis as well as IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic identification of the previously elusive 1,1,2‐ethenetriol, the higher energy enol tautomer of glycolic acid, a rather stable and hence unreactive biological building block. The title compound was generated in the gas phase by flash vacuum pyrolysis of tartronic acid at 400 °C and was subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10 K. The spectral assignments are supported by B3LYP/6–311++G(2d,2p) computations. Upon photolysis at λ=180–254 nm, 1,1,2‐ethenetriol rearranges to glycolic acid and ketene.",2021,2021-05-05 00:00:00,7.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f72b9e333714891db75f149498c801b21415ae9e

10.3390/bdcc7010045,Textual Feature Extraction Using Ant Colony Optimization for Hate Speech Classification,"Feature selection and feature extraction have always been of utmost importance owing to their capability to remove redundant and irrelevant features, reduce the vector space size, control the computational time, and improve performance for more accurate classification tasks, especially in text categorization. These feature engineering techniques can further be optimized using optimization algorithms. This paper proposes a similar framework by implementing one such optimization algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), incorporating different feature selection and feature extraction techniques on textual and numerical datasets using four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest (RF). The aim is to show the difference in the results achieved on both datasets with the help of comparative analysis. The proposed feature selection and feature extraction techniques assist in enhancing the performance of the machine learning model. This research article considers numerical and text-based datasets for stroke prediction and detecting hate speech, respectively. The text dataset is prepared by extracting tweets consisting of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments from Twitter API. A maximum improvement in accuracy of 10.07% is observed for Random Forest with the TF-IDF feature extraction technique on the application of ACO. Besides, this study also highlights the limitations of text data that inhibit the performance of machine learning models, justifying the difference of almost 18.43% in accuracy compared to that of numerical data.",2023,2023-03-06 00:00:00,21.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7542cd204cf08d7512bf6aac24e697a720df4f7c
10.1007/s11042-022-14216-w,An efficient hybrid stock trend prediction system during COVID-19 pandemic based on stacked-LSTM and news sentiment analysis,"The coronavirus is an irresistible virus that generally influences the respiratory framework. It has an effective impact on the global economy specifically, on the financial movement of stock markets. Recently, an accurate stock market prediction has been of great interest to investors. A sudden change in the stock movement due to COVID -19 appearance causes some problems for investors. From this point, we propose an efficient system that applies sentiment analysis of COVID-19 news and articles to extract the final impact of COVID-19 on the financial stock market. In this paper, we propose a stock market prediction system that extracts the stock movement with the COVID spread. It is important to predict the effect of these diseases on the economy to be ready for any disease change and protect our economy. In this paper, we apply sentimental analysis to stock news headlines to predict the daily future trend of stock in the COVID-19 period. Also, we use machine learning classifiers to predict the final impact of COVID-19 on some stocks such as TSLA, AMZ, and GOOG stock. For improving the performance and quality of future trend predictions, feature selection and spam tweet reduction are performed on the data sets. Finally, our proposed system is a hybrid system that applies text mining on social media data mining on the historical stock dataset to improve the whole prediction performance. The proposed system predicts stock movement for TSLA, AMZ, and GOOG with average prediction accuracy of 90%, 91.6%, and 92.3% respectively.",2022,2022-11-28 00:00:00,24.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f1a68e8a60e6e53dde383e16faedcb92522e68a

Even the commonly used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and long short-term memory (LSTM) have their own advantages and disadvantages. We use mean squared error (MSE) to judge the most suitable model for predicting Amazon’s stock price from many aspects and find that LSTM is the model with the best fitting effect and the closest to the real curve. However, the LSTM model still needs to improve in terms of performance so as to reduce the bias.

10.3390/jrfm15080350,Can Ensemble Machine Learning Methods Predict Stock Returns for Indian Banks Using Technical Indicators?,"This paper develops ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost in addition to Random Forest) for predicting stock returns of Indian banks using technical indicators. These indicators are based on three broad categories of technical analysis: Price, Volume, and Turnover. Various error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) have been used to check the performance of the models. Results show that the XGBoost algorithm performs best among the four ensemble models. The mean of absolute error and the root-mean-square -error vary around 3–5%. The feature importance plots generated by the models depict the importance of the variables in predicting the output. The proposed machine learning models help traders, investors, as well as portfolio managers, better predict the stock market trends and, in turn, the returns, particularly in banking stocks minimizing their sole dependency on macroeconomic factors. The techniques further assist the market participants in pre-empting any price-volume action across stocks irrespective of their size, liquidity, or past turnover. Finally, the techniques are incredibly robust and display a strong capability in predicting trend forecasts, particularly with any large deviations.",2022,2022-08-07 00:00:00,16.0,66.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc4843223c31a82d3ec135c7fce81d0c38589e9e

The coordination of gait movement is directly affected by the cooperation and functional connectivity between muscles. However, the mechanisms of muscle operation at different gait speeds remain unclear. Therefore, this study addressed the gait speed effect on the changes in cooperative modules and functional connectivity between muscles. To this end, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals were collected from eight key lower extremity muscles of twelve healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at high, middle, and low motion speeds. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) was applied to the sEMG envelope and intermuscular coherence matrix, yielding five muscle synergies. Muscle functional networks were constructed by decomposing the intermuscular coherence matrix, revealing different layers of functional muscle networks across frequencies. In addition, the coupling strength between cooperative muscles grew with gait speed.

10.5565/rev/elcvia.1187,Fully Convolutional Networks for Text Understanding in Scene Images,"Text understanding in scene images has gained plenty of attention in the computer vision community and it is an important task in many applications as text carries semantically  rich  information  about  scene  content  and  context.   For  instance, reading text in a scene can be applied to autonomous driving, scene understanding or assisting visually impaired people. The general aim of scene text understanding is to localize and recognize text in scene images. Text regions are first localized in the original image by a trained detector model and afterwards fed into a recognition module. The tasks of localization and recognition are highly correlated since an inaccurate localization can affect the recognition task. The main purpose of this thesis is to devise efficient methods for scene text understanding. We investigate how the latest results on deep learning can advance text understanding pipelines. Recently, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and derived methods have achieved a significant performance on semantic segmentation and pixel level classification tasks. Therefore, we took benefit of the strengths of FCN approaches in order to detect and recognize text in natural scenes images.",2020,2020-02-07 00:00:00,1.0,9.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1b49c740123e2e0a3b00afe10e856d9d54d71aa
10.1609/AAAI.V34I07.6812,Real-time Scene Text Detection with Differentiable Binarization,"Recently, segmentation-based methods are quite popular in scene text detection, as the segmentation results can more accurately describe scene text of various shapes such as curve text. However, the post-processing of binarization is essential for segmentation-based detection, which converts probability maps produced by a segmentation method into bounding boxes/regions of text. In this paper, we propose a module named Differentiable Binarization (DB), which can perform the binarization process in a segmentation network. Optimized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can adaptively set the thresholds for binarization, which not only simplifies the post-processing but also enhances the performance of text detection. Based on a simple segmentation network, we validate the performance improvements of DB on five benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and speed. In particular, with a light-weight backbone, the performance improvements by DB are significant so that we can look for an ideal tradeoff between detection accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, with a backbone of ResNet-18, our detector achieves an F-measure of 82.8, running at 62 FPS, on the MSRA-TD500 dataset.

10.3390/math11030700,Smart Traffic Shaping Based on Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Multimedia Streaming over 5G-VANET Communication Technology,"Vehicles serve as mobile nodes in a high-mobility MANET technique known as the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), which is used in urban and rural areas as well as on highways. The VANET, based on 5G (5G-VANET), provides advanced facilities to the driving of vehicles such as reliable communication, less end-to-end latency, a higher data rate transmission, reasonable cost, and assured quality of experience (QoE) for delivered services. However, the crucial challenge with these recent technologies is to design a real-time multimedia traffic shaping that maintains smooth connectivity under the unpredictable change of channel capacity and data rate due to handover for rapid vehicle mobility among roadside units. This research proposes a smart real-time multimedia traffic shaping to control the amount and the rate of the traffic sent to the 5G-VANET based on distributed reinforcement learning (RMDRL). The proposed mechanism selects the accurate decisions of coding parameters such as quantization parameters, group of pictures, and frame rate that are used to manipulate the required traffic shaping of the multimedia stream on the 5G-VANET. Furthermore, the impact of the aforementioned three coding parameters has been comprehensively studied using five video clips to achieve the optimal traffic rate value for real-time multimedia streaming on 5G communication. The proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline traffic shaping in terms of peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and end-to-end frame delay. This research will open new comfortable facilities for vehicle manufacturing to enhance the data communication system on the 5G-VANET.",2023,2023-01-30 00:00:00,21.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9a83eed8739574b9e90f7257c60a3cf37991082

This cross-sectional analysis explored the association between geriatric obesity and education level, along with other demographic characteristics in Taipei, Taiwan between 2013 and 2015. Taipei citizens ≥ 65 years (aborigines ≥ 55 years) were recruited to participate in the elderly health examination programme. Logistic regression was applied to analyse the relationship between obesity (defined as body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m2 in Taiwan) and education level among men and women after controlling for age, race, income status, and smoking status. A total of 28,092 men and 31,835 women were included in the final analysis. Compared to those with education years ≥ 16, older men and women with education years ≤ 12 had higher odds of being obese. The odds ratios increase as years of education decrease, and the trend is more pronounced among women. Aborigines had much higher chances of being obese among men and women, while there were no differences by income status. The results clarified the factors related to obesity in the elderly, and will be useful for authorities working to improve health outcomes among this population.",2020,2020-11-20 00:00:00,42.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9cbe8b36ce88eb1492b24326aaecd5490216545

10.1371/journal.pone.0232577,Stress and cancer-related lifestyle factors among African American heterosexual couples,"Intimate partners can have a profound influence on individuals’ health behaviors. In this exploratory research, we investigated the concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors including smoking, body mass index, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake, and alcohol use within African American heterosexual couples. We also examined whether females’ stress is associated with their own (actor effect) and males’ cancer-related lifestyle factors (partner effect), and vice versa. We analyzed a total of 216 heterosexual couples (i.e., N = 432 individuals) recruited from black churches. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated and multilevel modeling in which individuals are nested within couples was conducted. Results showed that there was high concordance of body mass index (ICC = 1.68, p < .001), fruit and vegetable intake (ICC = 1.62, p < .001), red meat intake (ICC = 1.50, p = .001), and alcohol use (ICC = 1.74, p < .001) between spouses. A multilevel analysis showed that there were actor and partner effects of stress on females’ BMI; females’ stress was positively associated with their own BMI (actor effect; β = .42, p = .006) and males’ stress was positively associated with females’ BMI (partner effect; β = .39, p = .026). Also, females’ stress was positively associated with their own red meat intake (actor effect; β = .20, p = .019). In conclusion, high concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors (BMI, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake and alcohol use) exists between African American spouses. Given the identified actor and partner effects of stress on females’ BMI, a couple-based lifestyle or weight management intervention that targets both male and female spouses’ stress and coping will be promising, particularly to enhance African American women’s health behaviors. Future studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying concordance and discordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors in African American couples. Also, factors that explain African American male spouses’ health behaviors need to be uncovered.",2020,2020-05-08 00:00:00,3.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/df5ef49976400d7cb3e4a7a7a1dc3da2c08ef897

Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with the upregulation of serum LEP. LEP promoter methylation is associated with obesity. So far, few studies have explored the association of BMI and OA with LEP methylation. We assessed the interaction between body mass index (BMI) and OA on LEP promoter methylation. Data of 1114 participants comprising 583 men and 558 women, aged 30–70 years were retrieved from the Taiwan Biobank Database (2008–2015). Osteoarthritis was self-reported and cases were those who reported having ever been clinically diagnosed with osteoarthritis. BMI was categorized into underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. The mean LEP promoter methylation level in individuals with osteoarthritis was 0.5509 ± 0.00437 and 0.5375 ± 0.00101 in those without osteoarthritis. The interaction between osteoarthritis and BMI on LEP promoter methylation was significant (p-value = 0.0180). With normal BMI as the reference, the mean LEP promoter methylation level was significantly higher in obese osteoarthritic individuals (β = 0.03696, p-value = 0.0187). However, there was no significant association between BMI and LEP promoter methylation in individuals without osteoarthritis, regardless of BMI.

The lower productivity exhibited by these SMEs in Sri Lanka was identified as a result of the high participation rate of female entrepreneurs in the informal economy. An unfavourable environment has been created obstructing the transition of women entrepreneurs towards the upper echelon of the business world through diverse impediments. Thus, the research focused on exploring the barriers that hinder the business growth of women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises. Accordingly, the research was conducted as secondary research: a literature survey. In Sri Lanka, a minor percentage of female participation in small and medium enterprises occurs due to limited access to financial resources, lack of financial literacy, social prejudices, social and cultural restrictions, and limited opportunities for networking and communicating with external resources. Thus, closing the gender gap in education, giving access to capital through a concerted policy action and providing women entrepreneurs with opportunities to improve their financial literacy and educational level were highlighted as the major recommendations in the study to empower women entrepreneurs to climb the value chain. Women entrepreneurs in small and medium-scale enterprises need to be facilitated with greater access to the domestic, regional and international markets in order to enable them to expand their businesses with productivity and innovation. Thus, vital policy measures should be taken to mitigate the barriers involved in formalizing the business mechanisms while focusing on increasing the benefits that women entrepreneurs can gain through that standardizing process.",2024,2024-04-30 00:00:00,2.0,5.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74c05632db18369cf611f7fb54e761b9f83eb999

10.1371/journal.pone.0282847,"Water level prediction using soft computing techniques: A case study in the Malwathu Oya, Sri Lanka","Hydrologic models to simulate river flows are computationally costly. In addition to the precipitation and other meteorological time series, catchment characteristics, including soil data, land use, land cover, and roughness, are essential in most hydrologic models. The unavailability of these data series challenged the accuracy of simulations. However, recent advances in soft computing techniques offer better approaches and solutions at less computational complexity. These require a minimum amount of data, while they reach higher accuracies depending on the quality of data sets. The Gradient Boosting Algorithms and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are two such systems that can be used in simulating river flows based on the catchment rainfall. In this paper, the computational capabilities of these two systems were tested in simulated river flows by developing the prediction models for Malwathu Oya in Sri Lanka. The simulated flows were then compared with the ground-measured river flows for accuracy. Correlation of coefficient (R), Per cent-Bias (bias), Nash Sutcliffe Model efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root mean square error (RMSE) were used as the comparative indices between Gradient Boosting Algorithms and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference Systems. Results of the study showcased that both systems can simulate river flows as a function of catchment rainfalls; however, the Cat gradient Boosting algorithm (CatBoost) has a computational edge over the Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The CatBoost algorithm outperformed other algorithms used in this study, with the best correlation score for the testing dataset having 0.9934. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Light gradient boosting (LightGBM), and Ensemble models scored 0.9283, 0.9253, and 0.9109, respectively. However, more applications should be investigated for sound conclusions.",2023,2023-04-26 00:00:00,13.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25e5c9f0526c05460f89851e71351df58ab9d05f
10.3390/ijerph191911928,Gender Inequality in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Associations with Parental Physical Abuse and Moderation by Child Gender,"Gender inequality perpetuates women’s economic insecurity and a culture of violence. Parental distress caused by economic pressure may increase violence against children. High levels of gender inequality and interpersonal violence may contribute to higher levels of physical abuse. Using an ecological perspective, this study examines the association of country-level gender inequality and household-level parental physical abuse, and the moderating role of child gender in this association in low- and middle-income countries. We used data on over 420,000 households from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and country-level indicators from the United Nations Development Program Human Development data. We employed multilevel logistic regression to examine the association between gender inequality with the log-odds of physical abuse after accounting for country- and individual-level covariates. In order to more fully explore our results, we calculated predicted probabilities of abuse for several scenarios. The results indicated that higher levels of gender inequality were associated with higher probabilities of physical abuse. This association was stronger for female children than for male children. The probabilities of abuse by child gender were indistinguishable, although rates of physical abuse converged as gender inequality increased, at a statistically marginal level. These findings indicate that macro-level interventions that reduce gender inequality are necessary to prevent and reduce child physical abuse.",2022,2022-09-21 00:00:00,19.0,62.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91493bebf5db46405cd24d9825e430186c5aaa90

We demonstrate that gender bias in a widely used internet search algorithm reflects the degree of gender inequality existing within a society. We then find that exposure to the gender bias patterns in algorithmic outputs leads people to think and act in ways that reinforce societal inequality, suggesting a cycle of bias propagation between society, AI, and users.

It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4–5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more.

To be useful in clinical practice, it is necessary to have well calibrated measures of the uncertainty with which these systems report their decisions. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are being often overconfident in their predictions, and are not amenable to a straightforward probabilistic treatment. Here, we describe an intuitive framework based on test-time data augmentation for quantifying the diagnostic uncertainty of a state-of-the-art DNN for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. We show that the derived measure of uncertainty is well-calibrated and that experienced physicians likewise find cases with uncertain diagnosis difficult to evaluate.

Efficiently programming these systems has become a major challenge due to the complexity of their architectures and the efforts required to provide them with co-execution capabilities that can fully exploit the applications. There are many proposals to simplify the programming and management of acceleration devices and multi-core CPUs. However, in many cases, portability and ease of use compromise the efficiency of different devices—even more so when co-executing. Intel oneAPI, a new and powerful standards-based unified programming model, built on top of SYCL, addresses these issues. In this paper, oneAPI is provided with co-execution strategies to run the same kernel between different devices, enabling the exploitation of static and dynamic policies. This work evaluates the performance and energy efficiency for a well-known set of regular and irregular HPC benchmarks, using two heterogeneous systems composed of an integrated GPU and CPU.

10.3390/s22010215,"Infrared Thermography for Measuring Elevated Body Temperature: Clinical Accuracy, Calibration, and Evaluation","Infrared thermographs (IRTs) implemented according to standardized best practices have shown strong potential for detecting elevated body temperatures (EBT), which may be useful in clinical settings and during infectious disease epidemics. However, optimal IRT calibration methods have not been established and the clinical performance of these devices relative to the more common non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) remains unclear. In addition to confirming the findings of our preliminary analysis of clinical study results, the primary intent of this study was to compare methods for IRT calibration and identify best practices for assessing the performance of IRTs intended to detect EBT. A key secondary aim was to compare IRT clinical accuracy to that of NCITs. We performed a clinical thermographic imaging study of more than 1000 subjects, acquiring temperature data from several facial locations that, along with reference oral temperatures, were used to calibrate two IRT systems based on seven different regression methods. Oral temperatures imputed from facial data were used to evaluate IRT clinical accuracy based on metrics such as clinical bias (Δcb), repeatability, root-mean-square difference, and sensitivity/specificity. We proposed several calibration approaches designed to account for the non-uniform data density across the temperature range and a constant offset approach tended to show better ability to detect EBT. As in our prior study, inner canthi or full-face maximum temperatures provided the highest clinical accuracy. With an optimal calibration approach, these methods achieved a Δcb between ±0.03 °C with standard deviation (σΔcb) less than 0.3 °C, and sensitivity/specificity between 84% and 94%. Results of forehead-center measurements with NCITs or IRTs indicated reduced performance. An analysis of the complete clinical data set confirms the essential findings of our preliminary evaluation, with minor differences. Our findings provide novel insights into methods and metrics for the clinical accuracy assessment of IRTs. Furthermore, our results indicate that calibration approaches providing the highest clinical accuracy in the 37–38.5 °C range may be most effective for measuring EBT. While device performance depends on many factors, IRTs can provide superior performance to NCITs.",2021,2021-12-29 00:00:00,28.0,68.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/443b9932d295ca3a014e7d874b4bd77a33a276bd

Because of the openness of IoT devices in the process of signal transmission, the recognition and access of different IoT devices are directly related to the wide application of its system. The radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) is a unique characteristic closely related to the hardware of IoT devices themselves, which is difficultly tampered. In this paper, four kinds of RF fingerprint feature extraction algorithms based on statistical features are studied. Robust principle component analysis (RPCA) is used for the dimensionality reduction and the support vector machines (SVM) is used for classification. Through theoretical modeling and experimental verification, the reliability and distinguishability of RFFs are extracted and evaluated, and the classification results are displayed in the real IoT equipment environment.",2019,2019-03-22 00:00:00,39.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d1492501bfceb602a59bb8d5b959610e6df36ce

10.3389/fnut.2022.784114,Higher Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio Is Associated With a Higher Risk of Stroke-Associated Pneumonia,"Objective Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is a frequent complication in stroke patients. This present study aimed to investigate the association between stress hyperglycemia and SAP. Methods Patients were screened between February 2013 and August 2020 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. We divided the blood glucose of the patients at admission by the glycated hemoglobin to calculate the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between SAP and SHR, with the confounders being controlled. Further, subgroup analyses were separately performed for stroke patients with and without diabetes. Results A total of 2,039 patients were finally recruited, of which 533 (26.14%) were diagnosed with SAP. SHR were divided into four quartiles in the logistic regression analysis, the highest SHR quartile (SHR ≥ 1.15) indicated a higher risk of SAP (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.13–2.19, p = 0.01) in total patients. In patients without diabetes, the third quantile (SHR = 0.96–1.14) and the highest quantile (SHR ≥ 1.15) were both related to a higher risk of SAP (both p < 0.05). However, we did not find such an association in diabetic patients. Conclusion SHR was significantly associated with the risk of SAP in patients without diabetes. Adequate attention should be paid to the patients with high SHR levels at admission, especially those without diabetes.",2022,2022-02-22 00:00:00,23.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4219d642e5104297c8b218904aae0c28625ee10
10.3389/fneur.2022.800614,A2DS2 Score Combined With Clinical and Neuroimaging Factors Better Predicts Stroke-Associated Pneumonia in Hyperacute Cerebral Infarction,"Objective To investigate the predictors of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) and poor functional outcome in patients with hyperacute cerebral infarction (HCI) by combining clinical factors, laboratory tests and neuroimaging features. Methods We included 205 patients with HCI from November 2018 to December 2019. The diagnostic criterion for SAP was occurrence within 7 days of the onset of stroke. Poor outcome was defined as a functional outcome based on a 3-months MRS score >3. The relationship of demographic, laboratory and neuroimaging variables with SAP and poor outcome was investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Fifty seven (27.8%) patients were diagnosed with SAP and 40 (19.5%) developed poor outcomes. A2DS2 score (OR = 1.284; 95% CI: 1.048–1.574; P = 0.016), previous stroke (OR = 2.630; 95% CI: 1.122–6.163; P = 0.026), consciousness (OR = 2.945; 95% CI: 1.514–5.729; P < 0.001), brain atrophy (OR = 1.427; 95% CI: 1.040–1.959; P = 0.028), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.715; 95% CI: 1.163–2.528; P = 0.006) were independently associated with the occurrence of SAP. Therefore, we combined these variables into a new SAP prediction model with the C-statistic of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78–0.90). Fasting plasma glucose (OR = 1.404; 95% CI: 1.202–1.640; P < 0.001), NIHSS score (OR = 1.088; 95% CI: 1.010–1.172; P = 0.026), previous stroke (OR = 4.333; 95% CI: 1.645–11.418; P = 0.003), SAP (OR = 3.420; 95% CI: 1.332–8.787; P = 0.011), basal ganglia-dilated perivascular spaces (BG-dPVS) (OR = 2.124; 95% CI: 1.313–3.436; P = 0.002), and core infarct volume (OR = 1.680; 95% CI: 1.166–2.420; P = 0.005) were independently associated with poor outcome. The C-statistic of the outcome model was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81–0.94). Furthermore, the SAP model significantly improved discrimination and net benefit more than the A2DS2 scale, with a C-statistic of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.83). Conclusions After the addition of neuroimaging features, the models exhibit good differentiation and calibration for the prediction of the occurrence of SAP and the development of poor outcomes in HCI patients. The SAP model could better predict the SAP, representing a helpful and valid tool to obtain a net benefit compared with the A2DS2 scale.",2022,2022-02-04 00:00:00,6.0,63.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30fd98944b72c8e5e86cd6dea2aa1aff7607a38b
10.3389/fmicb.2021.720051,Microbiology and Outcomes of Institutionalized Patients With Stroke-Associated Pneumonia: An Observational Cohort Study,"Background: The attributable mortality and microbial etiology of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) vary among different studies and were inconsistent. Purpose: To determine the microbiology and outcomes of SAP in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) for patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: In this observational study, included patients were divided into SAP and non-SAP based on a comprehensive analysis of symptom, imaging, and laboratory results. Baseline characteristics, clinical characteristics, microbiology, and outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: Of 200 patients, 42.5% developed SAP after the onset of stroke, and they had a lower proportion of non-smokers (p = 0.002), lower GCS score (p < 0.001), higher serum CRP (p < 0.001) at ICU admission, and a higher proportion of males (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.039) than patients with non-SAP. Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (78.8%), followed by Gram-positive aerobic cocci (29.4%). The main pathogens included K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Burkholderia cepacia. SAP prolonged length of MV (p < 0.001), duration of ICU stay (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p = 0.027), shortened MV-free days by 28 (p < 0.001), and caused elevated vasopressor application (p = 0.001) and 60-day mortality (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis suggested that patients with coma (p < 0.001) have a higher risk of developing SAP. Conclusion: The microbiology of SAP is similar to early phase of HAP and VAP. SAP prolongs the duration of MV and length of ICU and hospital stays, but also markedly increases 60-day mortality.",2021,2021-12-03 00:00:00,12.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/98f23e7af26de31f82392e5a38db3e0bbb21b208

To define hallmarks of severe COVID-19 in acute disease ( n  = 58) and in disease recovery in convalescent patients ( n  = 28) from Hannover Medical School, we used flow cytometry and proteomics data with unsupervised clustering analyses. In our observational study, we combined analyses of immune cells and cytokine/chemokine networks with endothelial activation and injury. ICU patients displayed an altered immune signature with prolonged lymphopenia but the expansion of granulocytes and plasmablasts along with activated and terminally differentiated T and NK cells and high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The core signature of seven plasma proteins revealed a highly inflammatory microenvironment in addition to endothelial injury in severe COVID-19. Changes within this signature were associated with either disease progression or recovery. In summary, our data suggest that besides a strong inflammatory response, severe COVID-19 is driven by endothelial activation and barrier disruption, whereby recovery depends on the regeneration of the endothelial integrity.",2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,65.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7fad85a3c9a0a54baa4f9da3904578c13edee2a6

Methods: We performed a longitudinal analysis of CSVD and clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with primary ICH who had MRI. Baseline CSVD load (including white matter hyperintensities [WMH], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces [EPVS]) was evaluated. The cumulative CSVD score was calculated by combining the presence of each CSVD marker (range 0–4). We followed participants for poor functional outcome [modified Rankin scale [mRS] ≥ 4], stroke recurrence, and time-varying survival during a median follow-up of 4.9 [interquartile range [IQR] 3.1–6.0] years. Parsimonious and fuller multivariable logistic regression analysis and Cox-regression analysis were performed to estimate the association of CSVD markers, individually and collectively, with each outcome. Results: A total of 153 patients were included in the analyses. CMBs ≥ 10 [adjusted OR [adOR] 3.252, 95% CI 1.181–8.956, p = 0.023] and periventricular WMH (PWMH) (adOR 2.053, 95% CI 1.220–3.456, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with poor functional outcome. PWMH (adOR 2.908, 95% CI 1.230–6.878, p = 0.015) and lobar CMB severity (adOR 1.811, 95% CI 1.039–3.157, p = 0.036) were associated with stroke recurrence. The cumulative CSVD score was associated with poor functional outcome (adOR 1.460, 95% CI 1.017–2.096) and stroke recurrence (adOR 2.258, 95% CI 1.080–4.723). Death occurred in 36.1% (13/36) of patients with CMBs ≥ 10 compared with 18.8% (22/117) in those with CMB < 10 (adjusted HR 2.669, 95% CI 1.248–5.707, p = 0.011). In addition, the cumulative CSVD score ≥ 2 was associated with a decreased survival rate (adjusted HR 3.140, 95% CI 1.066–9.250, p = 0.038). Conclusions: Severe PWMH, CMB, or cumulative CSVD burden exert important influences on the long-term outcome of ICH.",2021,2021-02-19 00:00:00,23.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7854722d54f40fbd756ed4820cc04cc1ceaab8c

We pose a series of questions about the nature of SVD‐related cognitive impairments and provide answers based on a comprehensive review and meta‐analysis of published data from 69 studies. Although SVD is thought primarily to affect executive function and processing speed, we hypothesize that SVD affects all major domains of cognitive ability. We also identify low levels of education as a potentially modifiable risk factor for SVD‐related cognitive impairment. Therefore, we propose the use of comprehensive cognitive assessments and the measurement of educational level both in clinics and research settings, and suggest several recommendations for future research.",2020,2020-11-13 00:00:00,117.0,123.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/245c522f0397d037539f09bab8c40e3c24b5df07

Based on extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (xDLVO) theory, the major fouling mechanisms, i.e., Lifshitz–van der Waals (LW), electrostatic (EL), and acid–base (AB) interactions, were for the first time quantitatively analyzed for model HA–bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures at different solution conditions. Results indicated that the pH, ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration of the solution significantly affected the physicochemical properties and the interaction energy between the polyethersulfone (PES) membrane and HA–BSA mixtures. The free energy of cohesion of the HA–BSA mixtures was minimum at pH = 3.0, ionic strength = 100 mM, and c(Ca2+) = 1.0 mM. The AB interaction energy was a key contributor to the total interaction energy when the separation distance between the membrane surface and HA–BSA mixtures was less than 3 nm, while the influence of EL interaction energy was of less importance to the total interaction energy. The attractive interaction energies of membrane–foulant and foulant–foulant increased at low pH, high ionic strength, and calcium ion concentration, thus aggravating membrane fouling, which was supported by the fouling experimental results. The obtained findings would provide valuable insights for the quantitative understanding of membrane fouling mechanisms of mixed organics during MF.",2018,2018-09-22 00:00:00,14.0,49.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2200fa0a28621ad857fb7e273cf5b41db54baef1
10.3390/W10070847,Membrane Fouling for Produced Water Treatment: A Review Study From a Process Control Perspective,"The offshore oil and gas industry is experiencing increasing water cuts as the reservoirs mature. The increase in produced water stresses the currently deployed deoiling technologies, resulting in more oil in the discharged water. Deploying membrane filtration to reduce the hydrocarbon concentration inherits additional complications related to fouling of the membranes: A process where the accumulation of material within and on the membrane surface adds additional flow resistance. This paper reviews and analyses the fouling detection, removal, prevention, dynamical and static modeling, with emphasis on how the membrane process can be manipulated from a process control perspective. The majority of the models rely on static descriptions or are limited to a narrow range of operating conditions which limits the usability of the models. This paper concludes that although the membrane filtration has been successfully applied and matured in many other industrial areas, challenges regarding cost-effective mitigation of fouling in the offshore deoiling applications, still exist. Fouling-based modeling combined with online parameter identification could potentially expand the operating range of the models and facilitate advanced control design to address transient performance and scheduling of fouling removal methods, resulting in cost-effective operation of membrane filtration systems. With the benefits of membrane filtration, it is predicted that membrane technology will be incorporated in produced water treatment, if the zero-discharge policies are enforced globally.",2018,2018-06-26 00:00:00,110.0,139.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0361d30d697336ccdb7da1c9fd739035d79daa7d

An experimental research demonstrates that SVM model based on SA (SA-SVM) has better predicted precision than SVM model based on Genetic Algorithm (GA-SVM). However, in the process of optimization parameters of predictive model of MBR membrane fouling model using SA, we found that SA has two problems: a slowness of convergence rate and the parameters selection is sensitive. Therefore, we introduce a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and combine SA with the GA, Adaptive Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm (ASAGA), to optimize the input data of MBR Membrane Fouling predictive model. This algorithm remains both the strong global searching ability of GA and the good local searching ability of SA.

However, the development of a flexible proximity sensor that can perform in a large range of object mobility remains a challenge. Here, a polymer-based sensor that utilizes a nanostructure composite as the sensing element has been presented for forthcoming usage in healthcare and automotive applications. Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)/Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) composites are capable of detecting presence of an external object in a wide range of distance. The proximity sensor exhibits an unprecedented detection distance of 120 mm with a resolution of 0.3%/mm. The architecture and manufacturing procedures of TPU/CNTs sensor are straightforward and performance of the proximity sensor shows robustness to reproducibility as well as excellent electrical and mechanical flexibility under different bending radii and over hundreds of bending cycles with variation of 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively. Tunneling and fringing effects are addressed as the sensing mechanism to explain significant capacitance changes. Percolation threshold analysis of different TPU/CNT contents indicated that nanocomposites having 2 wt% carbon nanotubes are exhibiting excellent sensing capabilities to achieve maximum detection accuracy and least noise among others. Fringing capacitance effect of the structure has been systematically analyzed by ANSYS Maxwell (Ansoft) simulation, as the experiments precisely supports the sensitivity trend in simulation. Our results introduce a new mainstream platform to realize an ultrasensitive perception of objects, presenting a promising prototype for application in wearable proximity sensors for motion analysis and artificial electronic skin.",2021,2021-01-13 00:00:00,37.0,72.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/037cffe91038c82aeb99268bfbe4fe76abfd2695

10.1002/ente.202300914,Time Series Prediction of Solar Power Generation Using Trend Decomposition,"High‐accuracy predictions of future solar power generations are important for monitoring, maintenance, dispatching, and scheduling. The goal of this study is to create a forecasting workflow that increases prediction accuracy independent of the machine learning method and has minimal computational requirements. The proposed trend decomposition method incorporates irradiance and seasonal features as exogenous inputs. In order to extract the linear part of the data, a moving average filter is used. The nonlinear (stable) component of the time series is then calculated by subtracting this linear part from the original data. The stable portion is modeled using several machine learning methods, while the ordinary least squares method is applied to the linear series. By aggregating both results, the final forecast is obtained. The forecasting performances of the machine learning algorithms on unprocessed data are used as baselines for evaluations. Improvements up to 39% in the mean absolute error and up to 31% in the root mean square error metrics are observed compared to the baselines. Experimental results show that the proposed trend decomposition with extrapolation method increases the forecasting performance and generalization capacity of machine learning algorithms.",2023,2023-12-09 00:00:00,5.0,23.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/611dce439727471404d96e5bec3eb64a735c3ecf

10.15587/1729-4061.2022.259653,Application of artificial neural network for wheat yield forecasting,"A given model of yield forecasting using an artificial neural network connects the wheat crop with the amount of productive moisture in the soil, soil fertility, weather, and factors in the presence of pests, diseases, and weeds. The difficulty of creating a yield forecast system is in the correct choice of predictors that have the greatest impact on yield.
To build the model, moisture in the 100 cm layer of the soil, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, humus, and soil acidity in the soil were used as input parameters. The amount of precipitation over 4 months, the average air temperature for the same period, as well as the presence of diseases, pests, and weeds were also taken into consideration. Data on 13 districts of the North Kazakhstan region in the period from 2008 to 2017 were used. The output parameter was the yield of spring wheat over the same time period.
The relative importance of input variables in relation to the output variable was used to determine the weight values of input variables.
An artificial neural network of error backpropagation was used as a method. The advantage of this method is that the quality of the forecast increases with a large amount of training data, as well as the ability to model nonlinear relationships between different data sources.
After training the artificial neural network and obtaining predictive data, good results were achieved for predicting wheat yields (p=0.52, mean absolute error in percentage (MAPE)=12.02 %, root mean square error (RMSE)=3.368).
Thus, it is assumed that the developed model for forecasting wheat yields based on data can be easily adapted for other crops and places and will allow the adoption of the right strategies to ensure food security",2022,2022-06-30 00:00:00,12.0,59.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38bb9e7cf235c5109456569e4dad4e653b4921fc

10.32890/JICT2019.18.1.8277,CELLULAR NETWORK TRAFFIC PREDICTION USING EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING METHODS,"Wireless traffic prediction plays an important role in network planning and management, especially for real-time decision making and short-term prediction. Systems require high accuracy, low cost, and low computational complexity prediction methods. Although exponential smoothing is an effective method, there is a lack of use with cellular networks and research on data traffic. The accuracy and suitability of this method need to be evaluated using several types of traffic. Thus, this study introduces the application of exponential smoothing as a method of adaptive forecasting of cellular network traffic for cases of voice (in Erlang) and data (in megabytes or gigabytes). Simple and Error, Trend, Seasonal (ETS) methods are used for exponential smoothing. By investigating the effect of their smoothing factors in describing cellular network traffic, the accuracy of forecast using each method is evaluated. This research comprises a comprehensive analysis approach using multiple case study comparisons to determine the best fit model. Different exponential smoothing models are evaluated for various traffic types in different time scales. The experiments are implemented on real data from a commercial cellular network, which is divided into a training data part for modeling and test data part for forecasting comparison. This study found that ETS framework is not suitable for hourly voice traffic, but it provides nearly the same results with Holt–Winter’s multiplicative seasonal (HWMS) in both cases of daily voice and data traffic. HWMS is presumably encompassed by ETC framework and shows good results in all cases of traffic. Therefore, HWMS is recommended for cellular network traffic prediction due to its simplicity and high accuracy.  ",2018,2018-12-11 00:00:00,24.0,14.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b01b4f8a5ef036990dd6b541d8351fb1c159d4f

The impact of the analyzed solutions was evaluated on the basis of model tests carried out in laboratory conditions. For the needs of the planned tests, a reverberation chamber was appropriately modified, ensuring in it the so-called free field conditions. On such a research stand, the propagation of sound wave was investigated as a function of distance, at different heights, for situations without the acoustic screen and after its installation, testing various solutions on its upper edge. On the basis of the conducted tests, the shielding effectiveness of the analyzed test samples was determined. In the second part of the article, a computational model was made, which corresponded to laboratory conditions so that it was possible to carry out the simulation of acoustic field distribution in the same configuration as in the laboratory tests.

10.1186/s44147-023-00353-y,Detection of epileptic seizure in EEG signals using machine learning and deep learning techniques,"Around 50 million individuals worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a chronic, non-communicable brain disorder. Several screening methods, including electroencephalography, have been proposed to identify epileptic episodes. EEG data, which are frequently utilised to enhance epilepsy analysis, offer essential information on the electrical processes of the brain. Prior to the emergence of deep learning (DL), feature extraction was accomplished by standard machine learning techniques. As a result, they were only as good as the people who made the features by hand. But with DL, both feature extraction and classification are fully automated. These methods have significantly advanced several fields of medicine, including the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, the works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using ML and DL techniques are presented as well as their comparative analysis is done. The UCI-Epileptic Seizure Recognition dataset is used for training and validation. Some of the conventional ML and DL algorithms are used with a proposed model which uses long short-term memory (LSTM) to find the best approach. Post that comparative analysis is performed on these algorithms to find the best approach for epileptic seizure detection. As a result, the proposed model LSTM gives a validation accuracy of 97% giving the most appropriate and precise result as compared to other mentioned algorithms used in this study.",2024,2024-01-19 00:00:00,20.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a38f3d38bf9e1538343b615fb6429f38732ecbe2

The proper diagnosis of epilepsy is crucial due to its distinctive nature and the subsequent negative effects of epileptic seizures on patients. The classification of minimally pre-processed, raw multichannel EEG signal recordings is the foundation of this article’s unique method for identifying seizures in pre-adult patients. The new method makes use of the automatic feature learning capabilities of a three-dimensional deep convolution auto-encoder (3D-DCAE) associated with a neural network-based classifier to build an integrated framework that endures training in a supervised manner to attain the highest level of classification precision among brain state signals, both ictal and interictal. A pair of models were created and evaluated for testing and assessing our method, utilizing three distinct EEG data section lengths, and a tenfold cross-validation procedure. Based on five evaluation criteria, the labelled hybrid convolutional auto-encoder (LHCAE) model, which utilizes a classifier based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and an EEG segment length of 4 s, had the best efficiency. This proposed model has 99.08 ± 0.54% accuracy, 99.21 ± 0.50% sensitivity, 99.11 ± 0.57% specificity, 99.09 ± 0.55% precision, and an F1-score of 99.16 ± 0.58%, according to the publicly available Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB) dataset.

In this article, FL technique has been uniquely applied for autism detection by training two different ML classifiers including logistic regression and support vector machine locally for classification of ASD factors and detection of ASD in children and adults. Due to FL, results obtained from these classifiers have been transmitted to central server where meta classifier is trained to determine which approach is most accurate in the detection of ASD in children and adults. Four different ASD patient datasets, each containing more than 600 records of effected children and adults have been obtained from different repository for features extraction.

To study the robustness of language grounding to adversarial perturbations in machine vision and perception, we propose Show-and-Fool, a novel algorithm for crafting adversarial examples in neural image captioning. The proposed algorithm provides two evaluation approaches, which check if we can mislead neural image captioning systems to output some randomly chosen captions or keywords. Our extensive experiments show that our algorithm can successfully craft visually-similar adversarial examples with randomly targeted captions or keywords, and the adversarial examples can be made highly transferable to other image captioning systems. Consequently, our approach leads to new robustness implications of neural image captioning and novel insights in visual language grounding.",2017,2017-12-06 00:00:00,128.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96e53b9c4e7ce52b32f090ceb3b069786559a2b7

10.3389/fnins.2020.00259,Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Novel Approach Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning,"Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common practice. Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.",2020,2020-05-13 00:00:00,231.0,79.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/809903d837638f092a7dab0c88d6f0816a1b317f

10.3389/fnins.2019.00509,Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease via Multi-Modality 3D Convolutional Neural Network,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis has attached great significance to artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modalities of imaging data, T1-weighted MR and FDG-PET are widely used for this task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to integrate all the multi-modality information included in both T1-MR and FDG-PET images of the hippocampal area, for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, instead, it utilizes 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis or prognosis of AD. To test the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MR and FDG-PET images in the ADNI datasets, including 731 cognitively unimpaired (labeled as CN) subjects, 647 subjects with AD, 441 subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) and 326 subjects with progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI). We obtained higher accuracies of 90.10% for CN vs. AD task, 87.46% for CN vs. pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI vs. pMCI task. The proposed framework yields a state-of-the-art performance. Finally, the results have demonstrated that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite when using a CNN for the classification, (2) the combination of two modality imaging data generates better results.",2019,2019-02-26 00:00:00,203.0,64.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfb2948bc7f1633d01ccb270f218b5ff68fec561

10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01939,Discovering a Transferable Charge Assignment Model Using Machine Learning.,"Partial atomic charge assignment is of immense practical value to force field parametrization, molecular docking, and cheminformatics. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling chemistry at unprecedented computational speeds given accurate reference data. However, certain tasks, such as charge assignment, do not have a unique solution. Herein, we use a machine learning algorithm to discover a new charge assignment model by learning to replicate molecular dipole moments across a large, diverse set of nonequilibrium conformations of molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms. The new model, called Affordable Charge Assignment (ACA), is computationally inexpensive and predicts dipoles of out-of-sample molecules accurately. Furthermore, dipole-inferred ACA charges are transferable to dipole and even quadrupole moments of much larger molecules than those used for training. We apply ACA to dynamical trajectories of biomolecules and produce their infrared spectra. Additionally, we find that ACA assigns similar charges to Charge Model 5 but with greatly reduced computational cost.",2018,2018-06-22 00:00:00,110.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5010579f8442e2fec34c277d6fc8e10a6bdbcf3

However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations. Simultaneous accurate and efficient prediction of molecular properties relies on combined quantum mechanics and machine learning approaches.

10.3389/fimmu.2022.1072526,Identification of the osteoarthritis signature gene PDK1 by machine learning and its regulatory mechanisms on chondrocyte autophagy and apoptosis,"Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease frequently diagnosed in the elderly and middle-aged population. However, its specific pathogenesis has not been clarified. This study aimed to identify biomarkers for OA diagnosis and elucidate their potential mechanisms for restoring OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis in vitro. Material and methods Two publicly available transcriptomic mRNA OA-related datasets (GSE10575 and GSE51588) were explored for biomarker identification by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). We applied the GSE32317 and GSE55457 cohorts to validate the markers’ efficacy for diagnosis. The connections of markers to chondrocyte autophagy and apoptosis in OA were also comprehensively explored in vitro using molecular biology approaches, including qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results We identified 286 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were enriched in the ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. After external cohort validation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, PDK1 was finally identified as a diagnostic marker for OA. The pharmacological properties of BX795-downregulated PDK1 expression inhibited LPS-induced chondrocyte inflammation and apoptosis and rescued OA-dysregulated autophagy. Additionally, the phosphorylation of the mediators associated with the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways was significantly downregulated, indicating the regulatory function of PDK1 in apoptosis and autophagy via MAPK and PI3K/AKT-associated signaling pathways in chondrocytes. A significantly positive association between the PDK1 expression and Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Plasma cells, and activated CD4 memory T cells, as well as an evident negative correlation between T cells follicular helper and CD4 naive T cells, were detected in the immune cell infiltration analysis. Conclusions PDK1 can be used as a diagnostic marker for OA. Inhibition of its expression can rescue OA-dysregulated autophagy and inhibit apoptosis by reducing the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways.",2023,2023-01-06 00:00:00,11.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12d9dc29928fff4157ad8c3bdb56a6f263914743
10.3390/cells11213430,"Identification of SLC3A2 as a Potential Therapeutic Target of Osteoarthritis Involved in Ferroptosis by Integrating Bioinformatics, Clinical Factors and Experiments","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of arthritis that causes joint pain and limited mobility. In recent years, some studies have shown that the pathological process of OA chondrocytes is related to ferroptosis. Our study aims to identify and validate differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) in OA chondrocytes and to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms. RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by four methods: limma-voom, edgeR, DESeq2, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interactions (PPI), and cytoHubba of Cytoscape were applied to identify hub genes. Clinical OA cartilage specimens were collected for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting (WB), histological staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and transfection. Sankey diagram was used to visualize the relationships between the expression level of SLC3A2 in the damaged area and clinical factors. Based on bioinformatics analysis, clinical factors, and experiment validation, SLC3A2 was identified as a hub gene. It was down-regulated in OA cartilage compared to normal cartilage (p < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that SLC3A2 was associated with ferroptosis-related functions. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression level of SLC3A2 in the OA cartilage-damaged area was closely related to BMI, obesity grade, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Furthermore, in vitro experiments validated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. In summary, we demonstrated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. These findings provide a new idea for the study of the pathogenesis of OA, thus providing new means for the clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy of OA.",2022,2022-10-30 00:00:00,34.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82f403b176c0944c37183592186ed35e3da94224
10.1155/2022/5600190,Identification of Biomarkers Associated with Diagnosis of Osteoarthritis Patients Based on Bioinformatics and Machine Learning,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is thought to be the most prevalent chronic joint disease. The incidence of OA is rising because of the ageing population and the epidemic of obesity. This research was designed for the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers for OA and analyzing the possible association between critical genes and infiltrated immune cells. 10 OA samples from patients with spinal OA and 10 normal samples were collected. GSE55235 and GSE55457 datasets including human OA and normal samples were downloaded from the GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between 20 OA and 20 controls. SVM-RFE analysis and LASSO regression model were carried out to screen possible markers. The compositional patterns of the 22 types of immune cell fraction in OA were determined by the use of CIBERSORT. The expression level of the biomarkers in OA was examined by the use of RT-PCR. In this study, an overall 44 DEGs were identified: 18 genes were remarkably upregulated and 26 genes were distinctly downregulated. KEGG pathway analyses revealed that pathways were significantly enriched including IL-17 signal path, rheumatoid arthritis, TNF signal path, and lipid and atherosclerosis. Based on the results of machine learning, we identified APOLD1 and EPYC as critical diagnostic genes in OA, which were further confirmed using ROC assays. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that APOLD1 was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Moreover, we found that EPYC was correlated with mastocytes stimulated, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory resting, DCs stimulated, T cells gamma delta, macrophages M0, NK cells stimulated, and mastocytes resting. Overall, our findings might provide some novel clue for the exploration of novel markers for OA diagnosis. The critical genes and their associations with immune infiltration may offer new insight into understanding OA developments.",2022,2022-06-13 00:00:00,24.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/beeae24f245a578f6df58c6b49633b2421d07488
10.1186/s12967-021-03183-9,Identification and development of a novel 5-gene diagnostic model based on immune infiltration analysis of osteoarthritis,"Background Osteoarthritis (OA), which is due to the progressive loss and degeneration of articular cartilage, is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore OA biomarkers for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of OA. Methods and materials The GSE129147, GSE57218, GSE51588, GSE117999, and GSE98918 datasets with normal and OA samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GSE117999 and GSE98918 datasets were integrated, and immune infiltration was evaluated. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the limma package in R, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore the co-expression genes and co-expression modules. The co-expression module genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, and hub genes were identified by the degree, MNC, closeness, and MCC algorithms. The hub genes were used to construct a diagnostic model based on support vector machines. Results The Immune Score in the OA samples was significantly higher than in the normal samples, and a total of 2313 DEGs were identified. Through WGCNA, we found that the yellow module was significantly positively correlated with the OA samples and Immune Score and negatively correlated with the normal samples. The 142 DEGs of the yellow module were related to biological processes such as regulation of inflammatory response, positive regulation of inflammatory response, blood vessel morphogenesis, endothelial cell migration, and humoral immune response. The intersections of the genes obtained by the 4 algorithms resulted in 5 final hub genes, and the diagnostic model constructed with these 5 genes showed good performance in the training and validation cohorts. Conclusions The 5-gene diagnostic model can be used to diagnose OA and guide clinical decision-making.",2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,26.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6cb8bc1b3c89e57b4420795caad6293ca13138b4
10.1186/s41065-021-00201-0,Identification and validation of hub genes of synovial tissue for patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were two major joint diseases with similar clinical phenotypes. This study aimed to determine the mechanistic similarities and differences between OA and RA by integrated analysis of multiple gene expression data sets. Microarray data sets of OA and RA were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). By integrating multiple gene data sets, specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of DEGs were conducted to determine hub genes and pathways. The “Cell Type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT)” algorithm was employed to evaluate the immune infiltration cells (IICs) profiles in OA and RA. Moreover, mouse models of RA and OA were established, and selected hub genes were verified in synovial tissues with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A total of 1116 DEGs were identified between OA and RA. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were enriched in regulation of cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, positive regulation of neuron differentiation, nuclear speck, RNA polymerase II transcription factor complex, protein serine/threonine kinase activity and proximal promoter sequence-specific DNA binding. KEGG pathway analysis showed that DEGs were enriched in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, FoxO signaling pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway. Immune cell infiltration analysis identified 9 IICs with significantly different distributions between OA and RA samples. qPCR results showed that the expression levels of the hub genes (RPS6, RPS14, RPS25, RPL11, RPL27, SNRPE, EEF2 and RPL19) were significantly increased in OA samples compared to their counterparts in RA samples (P < 0.05). This large-scale gene analyses provided new insights for disease-associated genes, molecular mechanisms as well as IICs profiles in OA and RA, which may offer a new direction for distinguishing diagnosis and treatment between OA and RA.",2021,2021-06-21 00:00:00,15.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58f9e64b3f792ca94ae5f8a7ae90096f1367a4c3
10.1186/s13075-020-02410-w,Proinflammatory T cell polarization is already present in patients with early knee osteoarthritis,"Background Investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms of early osteoarthritis (OA) is of utmost interest since this stage holds the strongest promise for therapeutic interventions. The aims of this study were to analyze if synovial inflammation is already present in early OA and to characterize the involved cell populations, by investigating synovial fluid (SF) and synovial membrane (SM) of early OA patients for the presence and polarization status of CD4 T cells. Methods A quantitative analysis of CD4 + T cell infiltration in SF and SM compared to peripheral blood (PB) was performed in patients with early stages of OA. We further investigated intracellular staining (ICS), surface marker, and chemokine receptor expression profiles of CD4 + T cells in SF, SM, and PB, as well as cytokine expression in native SF and PB. Matched samples of SF, SM, and PB were harvested from 40 patients with early OA at the time of surgery. Early OA was confirmed by independent surgeons intraoperatively. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for surface markers and cytokines, which are preferentially expressed by distinct T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells). Furthermore, we analyzed native SF and PB supernatants using MACSPlex for multiple cytokine expression profiles. Results SF and SM showed a distinct infiltration of CD4 + T lymphocytes, with significantly increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3/CCR5, cytokine IFN-γ (preferentially expressed by Th1 cells), and CD161 (preferentially expressed by IL-17 producing Th17 cells) compared to PB. Furthermore, the percentage of CD4 + T cells polarized to Treg was significantly increased in SM compared to SF and PB. No significant differences were observed for CCR3 and CCR4 (preferentially expressed by Th2 cells), although IL-4 values were significantly higher in SM and SF compared to PB. Cytokine analysis showed comparable results between PB and SF, with only IL-6 being significantly increased in SF. Conclusions Early OA joints show already significant inflammation through CD4 + T cell infiltration, with predominant Th1 cell polarization. Inflammation seems to be driven by direct proinflammatory cell interaction. Cytokine signaling seems to be negligible at the site of inflammation in early OA, with only IL-6 being significantly increased in SF compared to PB.",2021,2021-01-22 00:00:00,40.0,59.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b6abdb8092f7a246fc99514dc33b9240e17af9b3

The application of integrated omics to exploring robust signatures for clinical translation is increasingly highlighted, attributed to the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade in diverse malignancies. However, effective tools to comprehensively interpret multi-omics data is still warranted to provide increased granularity into intrinsic mechanism of oncogenesis and immunotherapeutic sensitivity. Results We developed a computational tool for effective Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR), providing comprehensive investigation of estimation of reported or user-built signatures, TME deconvolution and signature construction base on multi-omics data. Notably, IOBR offers batch analyses of these signatures and their correlations with clinical phenotypes, lncRNA profiling, genomic characteristics and signatures generated from single-cell RNA sequencing data in different cancer settings. Additionally, IOBR also integrates multiple existing microenvironmental deconvolution methodologies and signature construction tools for convenient comparison and selection.

10.21203/rs.3.rs-52517/v1,The landscape of gene co-expression modules correlating with prognostic genetic abnormalities in AML,"Background The heterogenous cytogenetic and molecular variations were harbored by AML patients, some of which are related with AML pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. We aimed to uncover the intrinsic expression profiles correlating with prognostic genetic abnormalities by WGCNA. Methods We downloaded the clinical and expression dataset from BeatAML, TCGA and GEO database. Using R (version 4.0.2) and ‘WGCNA’ package, the co-expression modules correlating with the ELN2017 prognostic markers were identified (R 2  ≥ 0.4, p < 0.01). ORA detected the enriched pathways for the key co-expression modules. The patients in TCGA cohort were randomly assigned into the training set (50%) and testing set (50%). The LASSO penalized regression analysis was employed to build the prediction model, fitting OS to the expression level of hub genes by ‘glmnet’ package. Then the testing and 2 independent validation sets (GSE12417 and GSE37642) were used to validate the diagnostic utility and accuracy of the model. Results A total of 37 gene co-expression modules and 973 hub genes were identified for the BeatAML cohort. We found that 3 modules were significantly correlated with genetic markers (the ‘lightyellow’ module for NPM1 mutation, the ‘saddlebrown’ module for RUNX1 mutation, the ‘lightgreen’ module for TP53 mutation). ORA revealed that the ‘lightyellow’ module was mainly enriched in DNA-binding transcription factor activity and activation of HOX genes. The ‘saddlebrown’ module was enriched in immune response process. And the ‘lightgreen’ module was predominantly enriched in mitosis cell cycle process. The LASSO- regression analysis identified 6 genes (NFKB2, NEK9, HOXA7, APRC5L, FAM30A and LOC105371592) with non-zero coefficients. The risk score generated from the 6-gene model, was associated with ELN2017 risk stratification, relapsed disease, and prior MDS history. The 5-year AUC for the model was 0.822 and 0.824 in the training and testing sets, respectively. Moreover, the diagnostic utility of the model was robust when it was employed in 2 validation sets (5-year AUC 0.743–0.79). Conclusions We established the co-expression network signature correlated with the ELN2017 recommended prognostic genetic abnormalities in AML. The 6-gene prediction model for AML survival was developed and validated by multiple datasets.",2020,2020-08-07 00:00:00,10.0,79.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ffa096e85bbd079fa55539f5c4345b280d26aef

Multiple cell types were identified based on profiling of 10,640 synoviocytes and 26,192 chondrocytes: 12 distinct synovial cell types and 7 distinct articular chondrocyte phenotypes from matched tissues. Intact cartilage was enriched for homeostatic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, while damaged cartilage was enriched for prefibro- and fibro-, regulatory, reparative and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. A total of 61 cytokines and growth factors were predicted to regulate the 7 chondrocyte cell phenotypes. Based on production by > 1% of cells, 55% of the cytokines were produced by synovial cells (39% exclusive to synoviocytes and not expressed by chondrocytes) and their presence in osteoarthritic synovial fluid confirmed. The synoviocytes producing IL-1beta (a classic pathogenic cytokine in osteoarthritis), mainly inflammatory macrophages and dendritic cells, were characterized by co-expression of surface proteins corresponding to HLA-DQA1 , HLA-DQA2 , OLR1 or TLR2 .

Existing studies have established the superiority of the artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms in this field. However, more recent studies have demonstrated promising PV solar power output forecasting performances by the decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Therefore, the present study aims to address a research gap in this field by determining the best performer among these 5 algorithms. A data set from the United States’ National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) consisting of weather parameters and solar power output data for a monocrystalline silicon PV module in Cocoa, Florida was utilized.

10.3390/buildings11080324,Compressive Strength Prediction via Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Concrete Containing RCA,"To minimize the environmental risks and for sustainable development, the utilization of recycled aggregate (RA) is gaining popularity all over the world. The use of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) in concrete is an effective way to minimize environmental pollution. RCA does not gain more attraction because of the availability of adhered mortar on its surface, which poses a harmful effect on the properties of concrete. However, a suitable mix design for RCA enables it to reach the targeted strength and be applicable for a wide range of construction projects. The targeted strength achievement from the proposed mix design at a laboratory is also a time-consuming task, which may cause a delay in the construction work. To overcome this flaw, the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, gene expression programming (GEP), and artificial neural network (ANN) was employed in this study to predict the compressive strength of RCA-based concrete. The linear coefficient correlation (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were evaluated to investigate the performance of the models. The k-fold cross-validation method was also adopted for the confirmation of the model’s performance. In comparison, the GEP model was more effective in terms of prediction by giving a higher correlation (R2) value of 0.95 as compared to ANN, which gave a value of R2 equal to 0.92. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to know about the contribution level of each parameter used to run the models. Moreover, the increment in data points and the use of other supervised ML approaches like boosting, gradient boosting, and bagging to forecast the compressive strength, would give a better response.",2021,2021-07-27 00:00:00,145.0,38.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a01282c9bcec60bff7c966a8891599bbc4fceba

However, no method is available to date to predict the compressive strength (CS) of rice husk ash blended concrete (RHAC). In this study, advanced machine learning techniques (artificial neural network, artificial neuro-fuzzy inference system) were used to predict the CS of RHAC. Based on the published literature, six inputs, i.e., age of specimen, percentage of rice husk ash, percentage of superplasticizer, aggregates, water, and amount of cement, were selected. Results obtained from machine learning methods were compared with traditional methods such as linear and non-linear regressions. It was observed that the performance of machine learning methods was superior to traditional methods for determining the CS of RHAC. This study will prove beneficial in minimizing the cost and time of executing laboratory experiments for designing the optimum content portions of RHAC.",2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,42.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e5b7bc4272d976826c1d91c039751cf56a9b8c2d

The proliferation of data obtained from site investigations and data acquisition systems provides an opportunity for the application of machine learning (ML) techniques. ML algorithms have been successfully applied in TBM tunnelling because they are particularly effective in capturing complex, non-linear relationships. This study focuses on commonly used ML techniques for TBM tunnelling, with a particular emphasis on data processing, algorithms, optimisation techniques, and evaluation metrics. The primary concerns in TBM applications are discussed, including predicting TBM performance, predicting surface settlement, and time series forecasting.

However, the conventional fitting algorithms are not suitable for accurate estimation of wetting properties, especially on hydrophilic surfaces, due to optical distortions triggered by changes in the focal length of the moving drops. Therefore, here we present an original setup coupled with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for estimation of Contact Angle (CA). The developed algorithm is trained on 3375 ground truth images (at different front-lit illuminations), less sensitive to the edges of the drops, and retains its stability for images that are synthetically blurred with higher Gaussian Blurring (GB) values (GB: 0–22) if compared to existing goniometers (GB: 0–12). Besides, the proposed technique can precisely analyze drops of various colors and chemistries on different surfaces. Finally, our automated orthogonal camera goniometer has a significantly lower average standard deviation (6.7° vs. 14.6°) and coefficient of variation (14.9 vs. 29.2%) than the existing techniques and enables wettability assessment of non-spherical drops on heterogeneous surfaces.",2023,2023-01-27 00:00:00,106.0,76.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16a20fd181dc2701add002cf05682df8b1bc304c

It is important to study the urban haze risk assessment to manage the haze disaster. The haze risk assessment indexes of 11 cities in Fenwei Plain were selected from three aspects: the sensitivity of disaster-inducing environments, haze component hazards and the vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies, combined with regional disaster system theory. The haze hazard risk levels of 11 cities in Fenwei Plain were evaluated using the matter-element extension (MEE) model, and the indicator weights were determined by improving the principal component analysis (PCA) method using the entropy weight method, and finally, five haze hazard risk assessment models were established by improving the particle swarm optimization (IPSO) light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithm. It is used to assess the risk of affected populations, transportation damage risk, crop damage area risk, direct economic loss risk and comprehensive disaster risk before a disaster event occurs. The experimental comparison shows that the haze risk index of Xi’an city is the highest, and the full index can improve the evaluation accuracy by 4–16% compared with only the causative factor index, which indicates that the proposed PCA-MEE-ISPO-LightGBM model evaluation results are more realistic and reliable.",2022,2022-12-19 00:00:00,37.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e6b1ac5308f74abf5d3e09a490fae929ebd2c0e

10.3390/app12115485,Prediction of EPB Shield Tunneling Advance Rate in Mixed Ground Condition Using Optimized BPNN Model,"Tunneling in mixed ground often results in severe torque fluctuations and a low advance rate. Therefore, choosing a reasonable set of parameters for accurate advance rate prediction is paramount to reduce cutter wear and improve tunneling efficiency. However, since the geological parameters in mixed ground conditions are diverse and uncertain, the prediction of the advance rate (AR) of EPB shield tunneling is significantly more difficult than that in homogeneous ground (i.e., full-face hard-rock ground). In addition, the operating parameters of the EPB shield tunneling can be subjective and suboptimal, and each of them has some intricate influence on AR. In this paper, an optimized back-propagation neural network by genetic algorithm (BPNN-GA) was proposed for reasonable operating parameter selection and accurate AR prediction, and four typical machine learning methods were used for comparison. Five processing strategies with different input parameters were also proposed and compared to determine the optimum selection of geological parameters in mixed ground conditions. The proposed models with strategies were adopted in the case study of the Nanjing Metro Line S6 project, and a total of 1188 rings of datasets were used for this study. The results showed that the proposed modified BPNN with the genetic algorithm could be effectively implemented for the AR prediction. It concluded that Strategy B—i.e., using the composite ratio and the geological parameters of each layer as input—was the best strategy in mixed ground conditions for advance rate prediction. Hence, a high correlation between measured and predicted AR was observed in this study with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.920.",2022,2022-05-28 00:00:00,5.0,23.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2327cf266111f4bac546177eaaba71773ccb9cd6

10.22608/APO.2018479,Promising Artificial Intelligence‐Machine Learning‐Deep Learning Algorithms in Ophthalmology,"Abstract: The lifestyle of modern society has changed significantly with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) technologies in recent years. Artificial intelligence is a multidimensional technology with various components such as advanced algorithms, ML and DL. Together, AI, ML, and DL are expected to provide automated devices to ophthalmologists for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders in the near future. In fact, AI, ML, and DL have been used in ophthalmic setting to validate the diagnosis of diseases, read images, perform corneal topographic mapping and intraocular lens calculations. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the 3 most common causes of irreversible blindness on a global scale. Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively detect the progression of a number of pathologies including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders. There are 2 methods of imaging used as diagnostic methods in ophthalmic practice: fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Of note, OCT has become the most widely used imaging modality in ophthalmology settings in the developed world. Changes in population demographics and lifestyle, extension of average lifespan, and the changing pattern of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, DR, AMD, and glaucoma create a rising demand for such images. Furthermore, the limitation of availability of retina specialists and trained human graders is a major problem in many countries. Consequently, given the current population growth trends, it is inevitable that analyzing such images is time‐consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Therefore, the detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders through unmanned automated applications system in the near future will be inevitable. We provide an overview of the potential impact of the current AI, ML, and DL methods and their applications on the early detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic diseases.",2019,2019-06-01 00:00:00,175.0,94.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5dc53e50148b01fe8b9536eb79fa6b1dce924174

Hence, it is very important to improve prediction accuracy. There is a rutting depth as a major indicator showing the state of pavement used in PMS. In this research, we propose a method to predict rutting depth by introducing a technique to improve prediction accuracy by suppressing over-fitting by dropout and gradient clipping in the recently rapidly developing NN (Neural Network) model. In addition, since pavement survey data are time series data that were inspected at the same place multiple times, we applied the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model which can model time series data. The proposed method was applied to rutting depth prediction of periodic survey data of Kawasaki city in Japan from 1987 to 2016. In order to compare prediction accuracy, we predicted three years later using proposed method and MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) which is a typical regression model and MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) which is most frequently used among NN models. The RMSE and correlation coefficient R between the prediction result and the measured value were compared.

10.1155/2017/8292056,Developing Pavement Distress Deterioration Models for Pavement Management System Using Markovian Probabilistic Process,"In the state of Colorado, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) utilizes their pavement management system (PMS) to manage approximately 9,100 miles of interstate, highways, and low-volume roads. Three types of deterioration models are currently being used in the existing PMS: site-specific, family, and expert opinion curves. These curves are developed using deterministic techniques. In the deterministic technique, the uncertainties of pavement deterioration related to traffic and weather are not considered. Probabilistic models that take into account the uncertainties result in more accurate curves. In this study, probabilistic models using the discrete-time Markov process were developed for five distress indices: transverse, longitudinal, fatigue, rut, and ride indices, as a case study on low-volume roads. Regression techniques were used to develop the deterioration paths using the predicted distribution of indices estimated from the Markov process. Results indicated that longitudinal, fatigue, and rut indices had very slow deterioration over time, whereas transverse and ride indices showed faster deterioration. The developed deterioration models had the coefficient of determination (R2) above 0.84. As probabilistic models provide more accurate results, it is recommended that these models be used as the family curves in the CDOT PMS for low-volume roads.",2017,2017-11-19 00:00:00,37.0,16.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25eef8ae6f489841078471bfcc4b284756cfccef

10.1186/1471-2156-12-75,Gene- or region-based association study via kernel principal component analysis,"BackgroundIn genetic association study, especially in GWAS, gene- or region-based methods have been more popular to detect the association between multiple SNPs and diseases (or traits). Kernel principal component analysis combined with logistic regression test (KPCA-LRT) has been successfully used in classifying gene expression data. Nevertheless, the purpose of association study is to detect the correlation between genetic variations and disease rather than to classify the sample, and the genomic data is categorical rather than numerical. Recently, although the kernel-based logistic regression model in association study has been proposed by projecting the nonlinear original SNPs data into a linear feature space, it is still impacted by multicolinearity between the projections, which may lead to loss of power. We, therefore, proposed a KPCA-LRT model to avoid the multicolinearity.ResultsSimulation results showed that KPCA-LRT was always more powerful than principal component analysis combined with logistic regression test (PCA-LRT) at different sample sizes, different significant levels and different relative risks, especially at the genewide level (1E-5) and lower relative risks (RR = 1.2, 1.3). Application to the four gene regions of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) data from Genetic Analysis Workshop16 (GAW16) indicated that KPCA-LRT had better performance than single-locus test and PCA-LRT.ConclusionsKPCA-LRT is a valid and powerful gene- or region-based method for the analysis of GWAS data set, especially under lower relative risks and lower significant levels.",2011,2011-08-26 00:00:00,24.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69d926957b16d3f9894aeed610c171930321dc8f

Understanding the mechanical behaviour of reinforced concrete structures subjected to blast is of paramount importance for minimizing the possible blast damage. A full-scale experimental program consisting of six reinforced concrete slabs with compressive strengths of 60 MPa, 50 MPa and 40 MPa, measuring 1.0 m × 1.0 m × 0.08 m, and subjected to 2.7 kg of non-confined plastic bonded explosive, was conducted in blast test area of Science and Technology Aerospace Department (Brazilian Air Force). This paper compares experimentally measured peak displacement values with theoretical values. Theoretical analysis was carried out using single degree of freedom (SDOF) models. The comparison showed that SDOF analysis worked very well in predicting the reinforced concrete slab peak displacement against blast effects. Qualitative analysis after the experiments showed that the blast wave shape generated by the cylindrical explosive was not uniformly distributed on the slabs for the standoff distance of 0.927 m∕kg1/3.",2018,2018-03-13 00:00:00,9.0,26.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e0348691d21fb5346f517c45c2b4a714912b39c

10.1038/s41380-019-0518-x,Understanding the genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders: the potential role of genomic regulatory blocks,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified numerous loci associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. The majority of these are in non-coding regions, and are commonly assigned to the nearest gene along the genome. However, this approach neglects the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and the fact that the genome contains arrays of extremely conserved non-coding elements termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which can be utilized to detect genes under long-range developmental regulation. Here we review a GRB-based approach to assign loci in non-coding regions to potential target genes, and apply it to reanalyse the results of one of the largest schizophrenia GWAS (SWG PGC, 2014). We further apply this approach to GWAS data from two related neuropsychiatric disorders—autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder—to show that it is applicable to developmental disorders in general. We find that disease-associated SNPs are overrepresented in GRBs and that the GRB model is a powerful tool for linking these SNPs to their correct target genes under long-range regulation. Our analysis identifies novel genes not previously implicated in schizophrenia and corroborates a number of predicted targets from the original study. The results are available as an online resource in which the genomic context and the strength of enhancer–promoter associations can be browsed for each schizophrenia-associated SNP.",2019,2019-10-15 00:00:00,24.0,90.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08e8cd9cddb6f5f55f2f08a36fb5458c3d643344

We used extensive, empirically-driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests, and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency <10% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with ≥80% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies >25%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called “Winner’s Curse”, was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) which led to more accurate effect size estimation. These insights provide a foundation for future eQTL studies, especially those with sampling constraints and subtly different conditions.",2017,2017-10-25 00:00:00,108.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a82173ddc291b7f605ea5f0950f0e094d6890130
10.1101/208447,Genetics of trans-regulatory variation in gene expression,"Heritable variation in gene expression provides a critical bridge between differences in genome sequence and the biology of many traits, including common human diseases. However, the sources of most regulatory genetic variation remain unknown. Here, we used transcriptome profiling in 1,012 yeast segregants to map the genetic basis of variation in gene expression with high statistical power. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that together account for over 70% of the total genetic contribution to variation in mRNA levels, allowing us to examine the sources of regulatory variation comprehensively. We found that variation in the expression of a typical gene has a complex genetic architecture involving multiple eQTL. We also detected hundreds of eQTL pairs with significant non-additive interactions in an unbiased genome-wide scan. Although most genes were influenced by a local eQTL located close to the gene, most expression variation arose from distant, trans-acting eQTL located far from their target genes. Nearly all distant eQTL clustered at 102 “hotspot” locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes and altered expression of their target genes though both direct and indirect mechanisms. Many local eQTL had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in trans. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.",2017,2017-10-24 00:00:00,134.0,127.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8932f29b432ca127ce0df3469b6e67990deb9a1f

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.",2017,2017-10-11 00:00:00,3388.0,81.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09e37c45e9a6785280f1abfd66bd59367c6ef53c

10.1534/g3.117.043752,Constraints on eQTL Fine Mapping in the Presence of Multisite Local Regulation of Gene Expression,"Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) detection has emerged as an important tool for unraveling of the relationship between genetic risk factors and disease or clinical phenotypes. Most studies use single marker linear regression to discover primary signals, followed by sequential conditional modeling to detect secondary genetic variants affecting gene expression. However, this approach assumes that functional variants are sparsely distributed and that close linkage between them has little impact on estimation of their precise location and the magnitude of effects. We describe a series of simulation studies designed to evaluate the impact of linkage disequilibrium (LD) on the fine mapping of causal variants with typical eQTL effect sizes. In the presence of multisite regulation, even though between 80 and 90% of modeled eSNPs associate with normally distributed traits, up to 10% of all secondary signals could be statistical artifacts, and at least 5% but up to one-quarter of credible intervals of SNPs within r2 > 0.8 of the peak may not even include a causal site. The Bayesian methods eCAVIAR and DAP (Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors) provide only modest improvement in resolution. Given the strong empirical evidence that gene expression is commonly regulated by more than one variant, we conclude that the fine mapping of causal variants needs to be adjusted for multisite influences, as conditional estimates can be highly biased by interference among linked sites, but ultimately experimental verification of individual effects is needed. Presumably similar conclusions apply not just to eQTL mapping, but to multisite influences on fine mapping of most types of quantitative trait.",2016,2016-10-29 00:00:00,26.0,75.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09e4fa8f85086bbd1c36cecdf42823274bf72774

There is, however, still a dearth of study about whether graduate students acquire the employability skills that businesses want of them because of their higher education. To determine a student's future employment and career path, it is critical to evaluate their soft skills. An emerging area called educational data mining (EDM) aims to gather enormous volumes of academic data produced and maintained by educational institutions and to derive explicit and specific information from it. This paper aims to predict students' soft skills such as professional, analytical, linguistic, communication, and ethical skills, based on their socio-economic, academic, and institutional data by leveraging data mining methods and machine learning techniques. All five soft skills were predicted using prediction models created using linear regression, probabilistic neural networks, and simple regression tree techniques. This study used a dataset from an open source that Universidad Technologica de Bolivar published. It covers academic, social, and economic data for 12,411 students. The experimental results demonstrated that the linear regression algorithm performed better than the others in predicting all five soft skills compared to machine learning methods.

The present study investigated important predictors in determining the satisfaction of undergraduate students (N = 425) from multiple departments in using ERL at a self-funded university in Hong Kong while Moodle and Microsoft Team are the key learning tools. By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores.

10.4236/jdaip.2020.84020,"Basic Tenets of Classification Algorithms K-Nearest-Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Neural Network: A Review","In this paper, sixty-eight research articles published between 2000 and 2017 as well as textbooks which employed four classification algorithms: K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN) as the main statistical tools were reviewed. The aim was to examine and compare these nonparametric classification methods on the following attributes: robustness to training data, sensitivity to changes, data fitting, stability, ability to handle large data sizes, sensitivity to noise, time invested in parameter tuning, and accuracy. The performances, strengths and shortcomings of each of the algorithms were examined, and finally, a conclusion was arrived at on which one has higher performance. It was evident from the literature reviewed that RF is too sensitive to small changes in the training dataset and is occasionally unstable and tends to overfit in the model. KNN is easy to implement and understand but has a major drawback of becoming significantly slow as the size of the data in use grows, while the ideal value of K for the KNN classifier is difficult to set. SVM and RF are insensitive to noise or overtraining, which shows their ability in dealing with unbalanced data. Larger input datasets will lengthen classification times for NN and KNN more than for SVM and RF. Among these nonparametric classification methods, NN has the potential to become a more widely used classification algorithm, but because of their time-consuming parameter tuning procedure, high level of complexity in computational processing, the numerous types of NN architectures to choose from and the high number of algorithms used for training, most researchers recommend SVM and RF as easier and wieldy used methods which repeatedly achieve results with high accuracies and are often faster to implement.",2020,2020-09-29 00:00:00,256.0,68.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/54039791f549714d210cd54f077eb69054d9d76b
10.1073/pnas.2018863118,Scalable deep learning to identify brick kilns and aid regulatory capacity,"Significance Monitoring compliance with environmental regulations is a global challenge. It is particularly difficult for governments in low-income countries, where informal industry is responsible for a large amount of pollution, because the governments lack the ability to locate and monitor large numbers of dispersed polluters. This study demonstrates an accurate, scalable machine-learning approach for identifying brick kilns, a highly polluting informal industry in Bangladesh, in satellite imagery. Our data reveal widespread violations of the national regulations governing brick manufacturing, which has implications for the health and well-being of the country. Our approach offers a low-cost, replicable method for regulatory agencies to generate information on key pollution sources. Improving compliance with environmental regulations is critical for promoting clean environments and healthy populations. In South Asia, brick manufacturing is a major source of pollution but is dominated by small-scale, informal producers who are difficult to monitor and regulate—a common challenge in low-income settings. We demonstrate a low-cost, scalable approach for locating brick kilns in high-resolution satellite imagery from Bangladesh. Our approach identifies kilns with 94.2% accuracy and 88.7% precision and extracts the precise GPS coordinates of every brick kiln across Bangladesh. Using these estimates, we show that at least 12% of the population of Bangladesh (>18 million people) live within 1 km of a kiln and that 77% and 9% of kilns are (illegally) within 1 km of schools and health facilities, respectively. Finally, we show how kilns contribute up to 20.4 μg/m3 of PM2.5 (particulate matter of a diameter less than 2.5 μm) in Dhaka when the wind blows from an unfavorable direction. We document inaccuracies and potential bias with respect to local regulations in the government data. Our approach demonstrates how machine learning and Earth observation can be combined to better understand the extent and implications of regulatory compliance in informal industry.",2021,2021-04-22 00:00:00,35.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/daad01f1af57cad9e3055b48a310470b2d3880a1

10.1073/pnas.2016238117,Satellites can reveal global extent of forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet,"Significance Forced labor in fisheries is increasingly recognized as a human rights crisis. Until recently, its extent was poorly understood and no tools existed for systematically detecting forced labor risk on individual fishing vessels on a global scale. Here we use satellite data and machine learning to identify these high-risk vessels and find widespread risk of forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet. This information provides new opportunities for unique market, enforcement, and policy interventions. This also provides a proof of concept for how remotely sensed dynamic individual behavior can be used to infer forced labor abuses. While forced labor in the world’s fishing fleet has been widely documented, its extent remains unknown. No methods previously existed for remotely identifying individual fishing vessels potentially engaged in these abuses on a global scale. By combining expertise from human rights practitioners and satellite vessel monitoring data, we show that vessels reported to use forced labor behave in systematically different ways from other vessels. We exploit this insight by using machine learning to identify high-risk vessels from among 16,000 industrial longliner, squid jigger, and trawler fishing vessels. Our model reveals that between 14% and 26% of vessels were high-risk, and also reveals patterns of where these vessels fished and which ports they visited. Between 57,000 and 100,000 individuals worked on these vessels, many of whom may have been forced labor victims. This information provides unprecedented opportunities for novel interventions to combat this humanitarian tragedy. More broadly, this research demonstrates a proof of concept for using remote sensing to detect forced labor abuses.",2020,2020-12-21 00:00:00,54.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c81a9de116a2deb9d6f0cc75b565380298b0c91e
10.3390/su12239834,Investigating the Potential of Radar Interferometry for Monitoring Rural Artisanal Cobalt Mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"Greater awareness of the serious human rights abuses associated with the extraction and trade of cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has applied increasing pressure for businesses to move towards more responsible and sustainable mineral sourcing. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activities in rural and remote locations may provide heightened opportunities to conceal the alleged human rights violations associated with mining, such as: hazardous working conditions, health impacts, child labour, child trafficking, and debt bondage. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method, teamed with high temporal frequency Sentinel-1 imagery, for monitoring ASM activity in rural locations of the “Copperbelt”, the DRC. The results show that the ISBAS descriptive variables (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) were significantly different (p-value = ≤ 0.05) between mining and non-mining areas. Additionally, a significant difference was found for the ISBAS descriptive variables mean, standard deviation, and minimum between the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnels). As expected, a high level of subsidence (i.e., negative ISBAS pixel value) was a clear indicator of mine activity. Trial activity thresholds were set for the descriptive variables mean (-2.43 mm/yr) and minimum (-5.36 mm/yr) to explore an ISBAS approach to active mine identification. The study concluded that the ISBAS method has great potential as a monitoring tool for ASM, with the ability to separate mining and non-mining areas based on surface motion values, and further distinguish the different mine types (industrial, surface, and tunnel). Ground data collection and further development of ISBAS analysis needs to be made to fully understand the value of an ISBAS-based ASM monitoring system. In particular, surrounding the impact of seasonality relative to longer-term trends in ASM activity.",2020,2020-11-24 00:00:00,15.0,82.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e5676a76e1a3d6fe4282e13818957eb4826757c

Using remote sensing methods, the location and impacts of fish-processing activities were assessed within a case study of Bangladesh’s Sundarbans mangrove forests. Ten fish-processing camps were identified, with some occurring in locations where human activity is banned. Environmental degradation included the removal of mangroves, erosion, and the destruction of protected areas. Previous studies have identified cases of labour exploitation and modern slavery occurring within the Sundarbans, and remote sensing was used to triangulate these claims by providing spatial and temporal analysis to increase the understanding of the operational trends at these locations. These findings were linked to the cyclical relationship between modern slavery and environmental degradation, whereby environmental damage is both a driver and result of workers subjected to modern slavery. Remote sensing can be used as an additional methodological tool to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and provide evidence to support the promotion of the “freedom dividend” which would have far-reaching economic, social, cultural, and environmental benefits. Satellite remote sensing is likely to play an important role going forward for understanding these issues but should be augmented with ground-based data collection methods.",2020,2020-09-17 00:00:00,13.0,108.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5332e534e5dd4af26d73044964bfc8c52ae693f4
10.3390/ijgi9090544,Mapping Brick Kilns to Support Environmental Impact Studies around Delhi Using Sentinel-2,"Cities lying in the Indo-Gangetic plains of South Asia have the world’s worst anthropogenic air pollution, which is often attributed to urban growth. Brick kilns, facilities for producing fired clay-bricks for construction are often found at peri-urban region of South Asian cities. Although brick kilns are significant air pollutant emitters, their contribution in under-represented in air pollution emission inventories due to unavailability of their distribution. This research overcomes this gap by proposing publicly available remote sensing dataset based approach for mapping brick-kiln locations using object detection and pixel classification. As brick kiln locations are not permanent, an open-dataset based methodology is advantageous for periodically updating their locations. Brick kilns similar to Bull Trench Kilns were identified using the Sentinel-2 imagery around the state of Delhi in India. The unique geometric and spectral features of brick kilns distinguish them from other classes such as built-up, vegetation and fallow-land even in coarse resolution imagery. For object detection, transfer learning was used to overcome the requirement of huge training datasets, while for pixel-classification random forest algorithm was used. The method achieved a recall of 0.72, precision of 0.99 and F1 score of 0.83. Overall 1564 kilns were detected, which are substantially higher than what was reported in an earlier study over the same region. We find that brick kilns are located outside urban areas in proximity to outwardly expanding built-up areas and tall built structures. Duration of brick kiln operation was also estimated by analyzing the time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the brick kiln locations. The brick kiln locations can be further used for updating land-use emission inventories to assess particulate matter and black carbon emissions.",2020,2020-09-11 00:00:00,19.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc54ed56ed8f3a89742d3469e9f7741725d7712e

In order to ensure the implementation of this global agenda, the UN proposed a systematic follow-up and review through indicator-based tracking and reporting of the progress with statistical and geospatial information toward SDGs at national, regional, and global levels. This has posed many technical and institutional challenges. Although international communities have devoted great attention to this hot topic, most of their work has focused on the conceptual design and preliminary testing. There are very few good practices for a comprehensive measurement and assessment of progress toward SDGs with the integration of statistical and geospatial information at national or local levels. This paper presents the methodology and results of a pioneer project which measured the progress toward SDGs at a local level in China (i.e., Deqing County) by integrating statistical and geospatial information. In this study, a number of technical/institutional issues have been tackled, such as the adoption of appropriate indicators at a local level, availability and acquisition of reliable data sets, and spatiotemporal analysis with a geographical perspective, interaction between SDGs and cross-sector coordination. The major conclusions are (a) the comprehensive progress toward SDGs in Deqing can be most appropriately measured and assessed by integrating geospatial and statistical information; (b) Deqing has made significant economic and social advances while maintaining a good ecological environment over the past few years.

10.3390/pr11020496,Study on Thermal Degradation Processes of Polyethylene Terephthalate Microplastics Using the Kinetics and Artificial Neural Networks Models,"Because of its slow rate of disintegration, plastic debris has steadily risen over time and contributed to a host of environmental issues. Recycling the world’s increasing debris has taken on critical importance. Pyrolysis is one of the most practical techniques for recycling plastic because of its intrinsic qualities and environmental friendliness. For scale-up and reactor design, an understanding of the degradation process is essential. Using one model-free kinetic approach (Friedman) and two model-fitting kinetic methods (Arrhenius and Coats-Redfern), the thermal degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) microplastics at heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 °C/min was examined in this work. Additionally, a powerful artificial neural network (ANN) model was created to forecast the heat deterioration of PET MPs. At various heating rates, the TG and DTG thermograms from the PET MPs degradation revealed the same patterns and trends. This showed that the heating rates do not impact the decomposition processes. The Friedman model showed activation energy values ranging from 3.31 to 8.79 kJ/mol. The average activation energy value was 1278.88 kJ/mol from the Arrhenius model, while, from the Coats-Redfern model, the average was 1.05 × 104 kJ/mol. The thermodynamics of the degradation process of the PET MPs by thermal treatment were all non-spontaneous and endergonic, and energy was absorbed for the degradation. It was discovered that an ANN, with a two-layer hidden architecture, was the most effective network for predicting the output variable (mass loss%) with a regression coefficient value of (0.951–1.0).",2023,2023-02-07 00:00:00,24.0,33.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0781ed1743f7a0486b83d2d8a74feb76becb25d

The present study focuses on the identification, characterization, and quantification techniques for tracking microplastics. Due to their unique compositional structure, unambiguous identification of individual polymers in various plastic samples, usually comprised of mixtures of individual polymers, remains a challenge. Therefore, there is limited research on the pyrolysis characterization of mixed samples. In this study, two analytical methods, TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS combined with thermogravimetric analysis were used to evaluate the thermal-degradation process of individual and mixed samples of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The primary interaction was the volatilization of terephthalic acid bound to chlorine molecules. The reduction of vinyl-ester functional groups and aromatic hydrocarbon intermediates related to olefin branching was confirmed. Char formation was increased, due to aromatic compounds from PET and PVC. All of the polymers used in the study may be underestimated in quantity, due to combined volatilizations during pyrolysis. TG-FTIR and TED-GC-MS showed forceful advantages in identifying mixed microplastics through different discrimination mechanisms. The study provides deep insight into pyrolysis behaviors and the interactions of mixed polymers, and the obtained results can help better comprehend the complex pyrolysis process.",2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,21.0,59.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0343eee68ec1b686feee5d799bb0b4c21d45929

The train and test datasets were obtained from jar test experimentation on the petroleum industry effluent (PIE) sample using aluminum sulfate (AS) as the coagulant. The ML algorithm from scikit-learn was employed to determine the optimum operating condition for the removal of colloidal particles, causing turbidity in the PIE. The predictive capacity of four ML models was compared based on their statistical metrics for clean discharge. The predicted optimum condition corresponds to pH (10), dosage (0.1 g/L), and settling time (30 min) which transcends to residual turbidity ≤ 10 NTU and translates to 95% removal efficiency. The second-order AS-sweep flocculation kinetic showed that at the predicted optimum conditions, modeled rate constant of 1.33 × 10−3 L/g.min and flocculation period of 1.2 min reduced the combination of the monomer, dimmer, and trimmer class colloids from an initial 570 mg/L concentration to the residual counts of 24 mg/L corresponding to residual turbidity ≤ 10 NTU under the mixing regime 14 s−1 ≤ G ≤ 164 s−1 satisfied the EPA standard for clean effluent discharge. It incorporated the selected ML output with time-evolution and aggregation kinetics to define sedimentation tank geometry for cleaner discharge. The findings from the design-driven optimization recommended a flow rate (1000 m3s−1), coefficient of kinematic viscosity (0.841 mm/s), and the required detention time (30–60 min) to define the sedimentation tank geometry.

It demonstrates that in recent years pyrolysis kinetics has turned into a major application of the thermokinetics. Analysis of the respective publications suggests that too often their quality leaves much to be desired because of the poor choices of the kinetic methods and experimental conditions. It is explained that the proper choices can be made by following the recommendations of the International Confederation for Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (ICTAC). To help with improving the quality of the kinetic results, the ICTAC recommendations are condensed to a few easy to follow principles. These principles focus on selecting proper computational methods, collecting better experimental data, and efficiently reporting the results. The paramount computational principle is to avoid using the methods that evaluate the activation energy and other kinetic parameters from the data measured at a single heating rate. It is shown that the kinetic parameters evaluated by such methods can give rise to striking examples of failure when estimating the thermal stability at ambient temperature.

10.5194/ANGEO-33-531-2015,Climatology of GPS phase scintillation at northern high latitudes for the period from 2008 to 2013,"Abstract. Global positioning system scintillation and total electron content (TEC) data have been collected by ten specialized GPS Ionospheric Scintillation and TEC Monitors (GISTMs) of the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN). The phase scintillation index σΦ is obtained from the phase of the L1 signal sampled at 50 Hz. Maps of phase scintillation occurrence as a function of the altitude-adjusted corrected geomagnetic (AACGM) latitude and magnetic local time (MLT) are computed for the period from 2008 to 2013. Enhanced phase scintillation is collocated with regions that are known as ionospheric signatures of the coupling between the solar wind and magnetosphere. The phase scintillation mainly occurs on the dayside in the cusp where ionospheric irregularities convect at high speed, in the nightside auroral oval where energetic particle precipitation causes field-aligned irregularities with steep electron density gradients and in the polar cap where electron density patches that are formed from a tongue of ionization. Dependences of scintillation occurrence on season, solar and geomagnetic activity, and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation are investigated. The auroral phase scintillation shows semiannual variation with equinoctial maxima known to be associated with auroras, while in the cusp and polar cap the scintillation occurrence is highest in the autumn and winter months and lowest in summer. With rising solar and geomagnetic activity from the solar minimum to solar maximum, yearly maps of mean phase scintillation occurrence show gradual increase and expansion of enhanced scintillation regions both poleward and equatorward from the statistical auroral oval. The dependence of scintillation occurrence on the IMF orientation is dominated by increased scintillation in the cusp, expanded auroral oval and at subauroral latitudes for strongly southward IMF. In the polar cap, the IMF BY polarity controls dawn–dusk asymmetries in scintillation occurrence collocated with a tongue of ionization for southward IMF and with sun-aligned arcs for northward IMF. In investigating the shape of scintillation-causing irregularities, the distributions of scintillation occurrence as a function of ""off-meridian"" and ""off-shell"" angles that are computed for the receiver–satellite ray at the ionospheric pierce point are found to suggest predominantly field-aligned irregularities in the auroral oval and L-shell-aligned irregularities in the cusp.",2015,2015-05-13 00:00:00,69.0,72.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c7828234feeb551461d827114e7d8e32c3d2a62
10.1002/2013RS005259,Characterization of high‐latitude ionospheric scintillation of GPS signals,"This paper presents statistical analysis of arctic auroral oval ionospheric scintillation events during the current solar maximum based on high‐rate Global Positioning System data collected in Gakona, Alaska (62.39°N, 145.15°W) from August 2010 to March 2013. The objective is to gain a better understanding of the climatology and morphology of ionospheric scintillation in high‐latitude regions. A scintillation event filter, multipath identification procedures, and other processes are applied to exclude nonscintillation related signal intensity and phase fluctuation and to extract scintillation events with S4 index above 0.12 and phase sigma above 6° from over 657 days of data. A total of over 5800 scintillation events were identified; most of them show phase fluctuations, only 10% of the phase fluctuations are accompanied by weak amplitude scintillation. Based on the occurrence time, signal direction of arrival, intensity, and duration of these scintillation events and the solar and geomagnetic activities associated with these events, diurnal, seasonal, spatial, and solar activity dependencies are derived and presented in the paper.",2013,2013-11-01 00:00:00,125.0,67.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a60e5885224a9f5fee53f68ff06eadfd3e52c3b7

As a result, electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity as they are independent of oil and do not produce greenhouse gases. However, despite their benefits, several operational issues still need to be addressed for EV adoption to become widespread. This research delves into the evolution of EVs over time and highlights their benefits, including reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. It also explores the challenges and difficulties faced in their adoption, such as the high cost of infrastructure, scarcity of charging stations, limited range or range anxiety, and the performance of batteries. To overcome these challenges, potential solutions include enhancing the charging infrastructure, increasing the number of charging stations, using battery swapping techniques, and improving battery technology to address range anxiety and reduce charging times. Governments can incentivize consumers to purchase EVs through tax credits or subsidies and invest in building a robust charging infrastructure. Industry stakeholders can collaborate with governments to address these challenges and promote the adoption of EVs, which can contribute to reducing carbon emissions and air pollution.",2023,2023-05-13 00:00:00,282.0,91.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0b5c8dbc1f3e76f73ad77277bddafb44da4b8e1

In the recent era of COVID-19 pandemic, this nonhuman, machine-based technology has gained a lot of momentum. The supercomputers and robotics with AI technology have shown the potential to equal or even surpass human experts’ accuracy in some tasks in the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) is prompting massive data interweaving with elements from many digital sources such as medical imaging sorting, electronic health records, and transforming healthcare delivery. But in thoracic surgical and our counterpart pulmonary medical field, AI’s main applications are still for interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung histopathological slide evaluation, physiological data interpretation, and biosignal testing only. The query arises whether AI-enabled technology-based or autonomous robots could ever do or provide better thoracic surgical procedures than current surgeons but it seems like an impossibility now.

It is detected by trained microscopists who analyze microscopic blood smear images. Modern deep learning techniques may be used to do this analysis automatically. The need for the trained personnel can be greatly reduced with the development of an automatic accurate and efficient model. In this article, we propose an entirely automated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for the diagnosis of malaria from the microscopic blood smear images. A variety of techniques including knowledge distillation, data augmentation, Autoencoder, feature extraction by a CNN model and classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are performed under three training procedures named general training, distillation training and autoencoder training to optimize and improve the model accuracy and inference performance. Our deep learning-based model can detect malarial parasites from microscopic images with an accuracy of 99.23% while requiring just over 4600 floating point operations. For practical validation of model efficiency, we have deployed the miniaturized model in different mobile phones and a server-backed web application. Data gathered from these environments show that the model can be used to perform inference under 1 s per sample in both offline (mobile only) and online (web application) mode, thus engendering confidence that such models may be deployed for efficient practical inferential systems.",2020,2020-05-01 00:00:00,117.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52af55894aa3a28e1c782d5154af7faa3bb90f60

Our results on simulated datasets and a publicly available dataset for amnestic mild cognitive impairment classification demonstrate that our CCNN model can efficiently distinguish between subject groups. We also show that the connectome-convolutional network is capable to combine information from diverse functional connectivity metrics and that models using a combination of different connectivity descriptors are able to outperform classifiers using only one metric. From this flexibility follows that our proposed CCNN model can be easily adapted to a wide range of connectome based classification or regression tasks, by varying which connectivity descriptor combinations are used to train the network.",2017,2017-07-20 00:00:00,109.0,63.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aab5933ff0250b341ffcaaa45a2fd6ba629e04e7

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of AD. Therefore, patients with MCI who are at high risk of fully developing AD should be identified to accurately predict AD. However, the relationship between brain images and AD is difficult to construct because of the complex characteristics of neuroimaging data. To address this problem, we present a longitudinal measurement of MCI brain images and a hierarchical classification method for AD prediction. Longitudinal images obtained from individuals with MCI were investigated to acquire important information on the longitudinal changes, which can be used to classify MCI subjects as either MCI conversion (MCIc) or MCI non-conversion (MCInc) individuals. Moreover, a hierarchical framework was introduced to the classifier to manage high feature dimensionality issues and incorporate spatial information for improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated using 131 patients with MCI (70 MCIc and 61 MCInc) based on MRI scans taken at different time points. Results showed that the proposed method achieved 79.4% accuracy for the classification of MCIc versus MCInc, thereby demonstrating very promising performance for AD prediction.",2017,2017-01-12 00:00:00,60.0,52.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba832850f65c451349af1de9a0178156a7928f57

However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions. Method: First, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of AD subjects. Coefficients of MIE with values higher than 0.98 quantile were highlighted to obtain the discriminant regions that distinguish AD from NC. Results: The experiments showed that the proposed method can predict AD subjects with a competitive performance with existing methods, especially the accuracy of the polynomial kernel (92.36 ± 0.94) was better than the linear kernel of 91.47 ± 1.02 and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of 86.71 ± 1.93.

This paper proposes a novel Chinese fine-grained NER (named entity recognition) method based on symmetry lightweight deep multinetwork collaboration (ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF) and model transfer considering active learning (MTAL) to research fine-grained named entity recognition of a few labeled Chinese textual data types. The method is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF was applied for verification in the CLUENER2020 dataset (Public dataset) to get a pretrained model; the experiments show that the model obtains an F1 score of 0.8962, which is better than the best baseline algorithm, an improvement of 9.2%. In the second stage, the pretrained model was transferred into the Manufacturing-NER dataset (our dataset), and we used the active learning strategy to optimize the model effect. The final F1 result of Manufacturing-NER was 0.8931 after the model transfer (it was higher than 0.8576 before the model transfer); so, this method represents an improvement of 3.55%.

The recognition of named entities based on Chinese is more complicated and difficult than English, which makes the task of NER in Chinese more challenging. In particular, fine-grained named entity recognition is more challenging than traditional named entity recognition tasks, mainly because fine-grained tasks have higher requirements for the ability of automatic feature extraction and information representation of deep neural models. In this paper, we propose an innovative neural network model named En2BiLSTM-CRF to improve the effect of fine-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks. This proposed model including the initial encoding layer, the enhanced encoding layer, and the decoding layer combines the advantages of pre-training model encoding, dual bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and a residual connection mechanism. Hence, it can encode information multiple times and extract contextual features hierarchically. We conducted sufficient experiments on two representative datasets using multiple important metrics and compared them with other advanced baselines. We present promising results showing that our proposed En2BiLSTM-CRF has better performance as well as better generalization ability in both fine-grained and coarse-grained Chinese entity recognition tasks.",2020,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9e45d4a6b3de0186e2cb430ecf01dcf17697342

Named entity recognition is a natural language processing task carried out to obtain morpheme sequences with specific meanings, such as person, location, and organization names. Although morphological analysis and named entity recognition are closely associated with each other, they have been independently studied and have exhibited the inevitable error propagation problem. Hence, we propose an integrated model based on label attention networks that simultaneously performs morphological analysis and named entity recognition. The proposed model comprises two layers of neural network models that are closely associated with each other. The lower layer performs a morphological analysis, whereas the upper layer performs a named entity recognition. In our experiments using a public gold-labeled dataset, the proposed model outperformed previous state-of-the-art models used for morphological analysis and named entity recognition. Furthermore, the results indicated that the integrated architecture could alleviate the error propagation problem.",2020,2020-05-28 00:00:00,5.0,19.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a37bc8e795c71dff4dc734bcb855df24b8120c5b

10.1109/TBDATA.2022.3232761,Bi-Directional Feature Fixation-Based Particle Swarm Optimization for Large-Scale Feature Selection,"Feature selection, which aims to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the size of the selected feature subset, is an important but challenging optimization problem in data mining. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has shown promising performance in tackling feature selection problems, but still faces challenges in dealing with large-scale feature selection in Big Data environment because of the large search space. Hence, this article proposes a bi-directional feature fixation (BDFF) framework for PSO and provides a novel idea to reduce the search space in large-scale feature selection. BDFF uses two opposite search directions to guide particles to adequately search for feature subsets with different sizes. Based on the two different search directions, BDFF can fix the selection states of some features and then focus on the others when updating particles, thus narrowing the large search space. Besides, a self-adaptive strategy is designed to help the swarm concentrate on a more promising direction for search in different stages of evolution and achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on 12 widely-used public datasets show that BDFF can improve the performance of PSO on large-scale feature selection and obtain smaller feature subsets with higher classification accuracy.",2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,23.0,60.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b94342c6c5a493f8bad55c030ab1319c05b597a6

10.3390/s23010272,A New Approach to Optimize SVM for Insulator State Identification Based on Improved PSO Algorithm,"The failure of insulators may seriously threaten the safe operation of the power system, where the state detection of high-voltage insulators is a must for the normal and safe operation of the power system. Based on the data of insulators in aerial images, this work explored an enhanced particle swarm algorithm to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine. A support vector machine model was therefore established for the identification of the normal and defective states of the insulators. This methodology works with the structure minimization principle of SVM and the characteristics of particle swarm fast optimization. First, the aerial insulator image was segmented as a target by way of the seed region growth based on double-layer cascade morphological improvements, and then, HOG features plus GLCM features were extracted as sample data. Finally, an ameliorated PSO-SVM classifier was designed to realize insulator state identification. Comparisons were made between PSO-SVM and conventional machine learning algorithms, SVM and Random Forest, and an optimization algorithm, Gray Wolf Optimization Support Vector Machine (GWO-SVM), and advanced neural network CNN. The experimental results showed that the performance of the algorithm proposed in this paper touched the top level, where the recognition accuracy rate was 92.11%, the precision rate 90%, the recall rate 94.74%, and the F1-score 92.31%.",2022,2022-12-27 00:00:00,16.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b90b44ae435f87a729913439bde57fb4e7f6a69f

To overcome the shortcomings in the existing university teaching quality assessment procedure, this paper designs an evaluation model for physical education departments based on long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). The model is constructed by analyzing the connotation and index system of teacher education teaching quality and constructing a fan-leaf structure model of teacher education teaching quality. Then, an improved PSO-LSTM model is proposed to train the teaching samples. The evaluation model applies the improved LSTM model and optimizes the network structure by dynamically adjusting the learning rate. The model is then optimized for the number of neurons and iterations of the network using the improved PSO. The results of the experiment indicate that the proposed model is effective in evaluating the quality of physical education. Moreover, the model analysis’ accuracy has greatly improved.

10.1155/2022/1825341,Feature Selection Based on Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization with Leadership Learning,"With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the curse of dimensionality becomes increasingly common. Feature selection (FS) is to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features in the datasets. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an efficient metaheuristic algorithm that has been successfully applied to obtain the optimal feature subset with essential information in an acceptable time. However, it is easy to fall into the local optima when dealing with high-dimensional datasets due to constant parameter values and insufficient population diversity. In the paper, an FS method is proposed by utilizing adaptive PSO with leadership learning (APSOLL). An adaptive updating strategy for parameters is used to replace the constant parameters, and the leadership learning strategy is utilized to provide valid population diversity. Experimental results on 10 UCI datasets show that APSOLL has better exploration and exploitation capabilities through comparison with PSO, grey wolf optimizer (GWO), Harris hawks optimization (HHO), flower pollination algorithm (FPA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), linear PSO (LPSO), and hybrid PSO and differential evolution (HPSO-DE). Moreover, less than 8% of features in the original datasets are selected on average, and the feature subsets are more effective in most cases compared to those generated by 6 traditional FS methods (analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi-Squared (CHI2), Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, and Mutual Information (MI)).",2022,2022-08-28 00:00:00,6.0,58.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c57777084a31515346dc87b6e06bc9c829996039

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity.

We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

In this paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, making the NMT model capable of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as sequences of subword units. This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively.",2015,2015-08-31 00:00:00,7488.0,42.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1518039b5001f1836565215eb047526b3ac7f462

10.37547/tajet/volume06issue12-11,PREDICTIVE MODELING OF HOUSEHOLD ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE USA: THE ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS,"Understanding the pattern of energy use at the household level becomes ever more urgent in light of growing concerns about climate change and resource sustainability in the USA. Energy use depends upon various factors, such as climate, household characteristics, and behavior. Of these, income, education, and size of the family are very vital socio-economic factors that depict energy consumption levels and their pattern. The utmost objective of this research project was to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to analyze household energy consumption trends in the USA, integrating socioeconomic factors such as income, family size, and education. The dataset retrieved from Kaggle integrates detailed weather patterns with energy consumption data, putting into perspective the interaction between climatic variables and household energy use. It included key features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, along with time-series data on energy consumption metrics like electricity and natural gas usage at the household level. It provided information on several geographic zones across extended periods, so seasonality and regional variations may be studied. It was complemented with metadata that included timestamps, energy pricing, and household attributes and should therefore be a rich resource for predictive modeling and extracting relationships between weather conditions and energy demand. For this research project, three models were selected: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, each possessing particular strengths for the nature of the problem. This study employed key performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy. The Random Forest model had the highest value for accuracy, similarly, the highest AUC was for the Random Forest with the best AUC. As such, it was concluded that the Random Forest model provided the best trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate and can be relied upon for this classification task. The machine learning models generate valuable predictions about household energy use. Particularly, Random Forest models, which are trained on socioeconomic and weather data to predict the likelihood of a given household having high energy usage.

We intended to investigate nonlinear relationships typical of the atmospheric variables using state-of-the-art ML methods for more accurate rainfall predictions. For this research project on rainfall forecasting in the USA, we utilized an extensive dataset that comprises historical rainfall data collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other meteorological agencies. The main dataset we use in this paper consists of daily rainfall measurements across various geographical locations of the USA, thus capturing the wide-ranging historical data necessary for both training and validation of the model. Besides measuring rainfall, we included meteorological data from sources such as NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications. These datasets further provided key variables that are known to affect rain, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The performance metrics used in this research work for the models considered include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The above table shows that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other models, achieving perfect accuracy. That indicated that it rightly classified all the instances in the test set. The Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models gave a quite good performance by giving above average accuracy but had lower precision and recall for the rainfall prediction.

10.1088/1361-6560/aca512,Incorporating cross-voxel exchange for the analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging data: pre-clinical results,"Tumours exhibit abnormal interstitial structures and vasculature function often leading to impaired and heterogeneous drug delivery. The disproportionate spatial accumulation of a drug in the interstitium is determined by several microenvironmental properties (blood vessel distribution and permeability, gradients in the interstitial fluid pressure). Predictions of tumour perfusion are key determinants of drug delivery and responsiveness to therapy. Pharmacokinetic models allow for the quantification of tracer perfusion based on contrast enhancement measured with non-invasive imaging techniques. An advanced cross-voxel exchange model (CVXM) was recently developed to provide a comprehensive description of tracer extravasation as well as advection and diffusion based on cross-voxel tracer kinetics (Sinno et al 2021). Transport parameters were derived from DCE-MRI of twenty TS-415 human cervical carcinoma xenografts by using CVXM. Tracer velocity flows were measured at the tumour periphery (mean 1.78–5.82 μm.s−1) pushing the contrast outward towards normal tissue. These elevated velocity measures and extravasation rates explain the heterogeneous distribution of tracer across the tumour and its accumulation at the periphery. Significant values for diffusivity were deduced across the tumours (mean 152–499 μm2.s−1). CVXM resulted in generally smaller values for the extravasation parameter Kext (mean 0.01–0.04 min−1) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction ve (mean 0.05–0.17) compared to the standard Tofts parameters, suggesting that Toft model underestimates the effects of inter-voxel exchange. The ratio of Tofts’ extravasation parameters over CVXM’s was significantly positively correlated to the cross-voxel diffusivity (P < 0.0001) and velocity (P = 0.0005). Tofts’ increased ve measurements were explained using Sinno et al (2021)’s theoretical work. Finally, a scan time of 15 min renders informative estimations of the transport parameters. However, a duration as low as 7.5 min is acceptable to recognize the spatial variation of transport parameters. The results demonstrate the potential of utilizing CVXM for determining metrics characterizing the exchange of tracer between the vasculature and the tumour tissue. Like for many earlier models, additional work is strongly recommended, in terms of validation, to develop more confidence in the results, motivating future laboratory work in this regard.",2022,2022-11-22 00:00:00,2.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f8cf015f31b5bcd7e5c9e143ebd7bcf132982f5

Some of the most common models employed in clinical practice, such as the standard Tofts model (STM) or the extended Tofts model (ETM), do not account for passive delivery of contrast agent (CA) through diffusion. In this work, we introduce a diffusive term based on the concept of effective diffusivity into a finite element (FE) implementation of the ETM formulation, obtaining a new formulation for the diffusion-corrected ETM (D-ETM). A gradient-based optimization algorithm is developed to characterize the vascular properties of the tumour from the CA concentration curves obtained from imaging clinical data. To test the potential of our approach, several theoretical distributions of CA concentration are generated on a benchmark problem and a real tumour geometry. The vascular properties used to generate these distributions are estimated from an inverse analysis based on both the ETM and the D-ETM approaches. The outcome of these analyses shows the limitations of the ETM to retrieve accurate parameters in the presence of diffusion. The ETM returns smoothed distributions of vascular properties, reaching unphysical values in some of them, while the D-ETM accurately depicted the heterogeneity of KTrans, ve\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$_{e}$$\end{document} and vp\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$_{p}$$\end{document} distributions (mean absolute relative difference (ARD) of 16%, 15% and 9%, respectively, for the real geometry case) keeping all their values within their physiological ranges, outperforming the ETM.",2022,2022-06-01 00:00:00,7.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1dc690820fe5e3874220f8232289b14b639a417a

10.3390/vaccines9060556,"Side Effects and Perceptions Following COVID-19 Vaccination in Jordan: A Randomized, Cross-Sectional Study Implementing Machine Learning for Predicting Severity of Side Effects","Background: Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic, there was no doubt that vaccination is the ideal protocol to tackle it. Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects; while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body’s immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data; predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.",2021,2021-05-26 00:00:00,175.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1497e7ef43447f01ffb42240ad8b29825526b4c0

Furthermore, the performance of genetic factors in predicting dyslipidaemia has not been explored. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate prediction models with and without genetic factors for dyslipidaemia in rural populations. A total of 3596 individuals from the Henan Rural Cohort Study were included in this study. According to the ratio of 7:3, all individuals were divided into a training set and a testing set. The conventional models and conventional+GRS (genetic risk score) models were developed with Cox regression, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifiers in the training set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI) were used to assess the discrimination ability of the models, and the calibration curve was used to show calibration ability in the testing set. Compared to the lowest quartile of GRS, the hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of individuals in the highest quartile of GRS was 1.23(1.07, 1.41) in the total population. Age, family history of diabetes, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were used to develop the conventional models, and the AUCs of the Cox, ANN, RF, and GBM classifiers were 0.702(0.673, 0.729), 0.736(0.708, 0.762), 0.787 (0.762, 0.811), and 0.816(0.792, 0.839), respectively. After adding GRS, the AUCs increased by 0.005, 0.018, 0.023, and 0.015 with the Cox, ANN, RF, and GBM classifiers, respectively. The corresponding NRI and IDI were 25.6, 7.8, 14.1, and 18.1% and 2.3, 1.0, 2.5, and 1.8%, respectively.

10.1155/2021/6679512,Involvement of Machine Learning Tools in Healthcare Decision Making,"In the present day, there are many diseases which need to be identified at their early stages to start relevant treatments. If not, they could be uncurable and deadly. Due to this reason, there is a need of analysing complex medical data, medical reports, and medical images at a lesser time but with greater accuracy. There are even some instances where certain abnormalities cannot be directly recognized by humans. In healthcare for computational decision making, machine learning approaches are being used in these types of situations where a crucial data analysis needs to be performed on medical data to reveal hidden relationships or abnormalities which are not visible to humans. Implementing algorithms to perform such tasks itself is difficult, but what makes it even more challenging is to increase the accuracy of the algorithm while decreasing the required time for the algorithm to execute. In the early days, processing of large amount of medical data was an important task which resulted in machine learning being adapted in the biological domain. Since this happened, the biology and biomedical fields have been reaching higher levels by exploring more knowledge and identifying relationships which were never observed before. Reaching to its peak now the concern is being diverted towards treating patients not only based on the type of disease but also their genetics, which is known as precision medicine. Modifications in machine learning algorithms are being performed and tested daily to improve the performance of the algorithms in analysing and presenting more accurate information. In the healthcare field, starting from information extraction from medical documents until the prediction or diagnosis of a disease, machine learning has been involved. Medical imaging is a section that was greatly improved with the integration of machine learning algorithms to the field of computational biology. Nowadays, many disease diagnoses are being performed by medical image processing using machine learning algorithms. In addition, patient care, resource allocation, and research on treatments for various diseases are also being performed using machine learning-based computational decision making. Throughout this paper, various machine learning algorithms and approaches that are being used for decision making in the healthcare sector will be discussed along with the involvement of machine learning in healthcare applications in the current context. With the explored knowledge, it was evident that neural network-based deep learning methods have performed extremely well in the field of computational biology with the support of the high processing power of modern sophisticated computers and are being extensively applied because of their high predicting accuracy and reliability. When giving concern towards the big picture by combining the observations, it is noticeable that computational biology and biomedicine-based decision making in healthcare have now become dependent on machine learning algorithms, and thus they cannot be separated from the field of artificial intelligence.",2021,2021-01-27 00:00:00,160.0,60.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e082f23f27f632123d594967e50da93d4a3e5ab3

This type of optimization constraint, expressed via an additional loss function, allows for further reducing the size of the regions that are mapped from the source domain into the same image in the target domain, which leads to mapping closer to the bijective and thus better performance. By selecting feature maps of the network layers with the same depth d in the encoder of the direct generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the decoder of the inverse GAN, it is possible to describe their d-dimensional probability distributions and, through novel regularization term, enforce similarity between representations of the same image in both domains during the mapping cycle. We introduce several ground distances between Gaussian distributions of the corresponding feature maps used in the regularization. In the experiments conducted on several real datasets, we achieved better performance in the unsupervised image transfer task in comparison to the baseline CycleGAN, and obtained results that were much closer to the fully supervised pix2pix method for all used datasets. The PSNR measure of the proposed method was, on average, 4.7% closer to the results of the pix2pix method in comparison to the baseline CycleGAN over all datasets. This also held for SSIM, where the described percentage was 8.3% on average over all datasets.",2023,2023-01-10 00:00:00,4.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60ddeb6ef659cba30d4c63aefab971a2b96d9582

10.3390/app12073411,Bootstrapped SSL CycleGAN for Asymmetric Domain Transfer,"Most CycleGAN domain transfer architectures require a large amount of data belonging to domains on which the domain transfer task is to be applied. Nevertheless, in many real-world applications one of the domains is reduced, i.e., scarce. This means that it has much less training data available in comparison to the other domain, which is fully observable. In order to tackle the problem of using CycleGAN framework in such unfavorable application scenarios, we propose and invoke a novel Bootstrapped SSL CycleGAN architecture (BTS-SSL), where the mentioned problem is overcome using two strategies. Firstly, by using a relatively small percentage of available labelled training data from the reduced or scarce domain and a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach, we prevent overfitting of the discriminator belonging to the reduced domain, which would otherwise occur during initial training iterations due to the small amount of available training data in the scarce domain. Secondly, after initial learning guided by the described SSL strategy, additional bootstrapping (BTS) of the reduced data domain is performed by inserting artifically generated training examples into the training poll of the data discriminator belonging to the scarce domain. Bootstrapped samples are generated by the already trained neural network that performs transferring from the fully observable to the scarce domain. The described procedure is periodically repeated during the training process several times and results in significantly improved performance of the final model in comparison to the original unsupervised CycleGAN approach. The same also holds in comparison to the solutions that are exclusively based either on the described SSL, or on the bootstrapping strategy, i.e., when these are applied separately. Moreover, in the considered scarce scenarios it also shows competitive results in comparison to the fully supervised solution based on the pix2pix method. In that sense, it is directly applicable to many domain transfer tasks that are relying on the CycleGAN architecture.",2022,2022-03-27 00:00:00,3.0,5.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a850dc63f00f4a16c5535ac6a658df41811904ad
10.3390/e24030414,Speaker Recognition Using Constrained Convolutional Neural Networks in Emotional Speech,"Speaker recognition is an important classification task, which can be solved using several approaches. Although building a speaker recognition model on a closed set of speakers under neutral speaking conditions is a well-researched task and there are solutions that provide excellent performance, the classification accuracy of developed models significantly decreases when applying them to emotional speech or in the presence of interference. Furthermore, deep models may require a large number of parameters, so constrained solutions are desirable in order to implement them on edge devices in the Internet of Things systems for real-time detection. The aim of this paper is to propose a simple and constrained convolutional neural network for speaker recognition tasks and to examine its robustness for recognition in emotional speech conditions. We examine three quantization methods for developing a constrained network: floating-point eight format, ternary scalar quantization, and binary scalar quantization. The results are demonstrated on the recently recorded SEAC dataset.",2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,16.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36f61d725a5dc8ade5ccfab166d53f232c536eb1
10.3897/jucs.2020.023,Speaker/Style-Dependent Neural Network Speech Synthesis Based on Speaker/Style Embedding,"The paper presents a novel architecture and method for training neural networks to produce synthesized speech in a particular voice and speaking style, based on a small quantity of target speaker/style training data. The method is based on neural network embedding, i.e. mapping of discrete variables into continuous vectors in a low-dimensional space, which has been shown to be a very successful universal deep learning technique. In this particular case, different speaker/style combinations are mapped into different points in a low-dimensional space, which enables the network to capture the similarities and differences between speakers and speaking styles more efficiently. The initial model from which speaker/style adaptation was carried out was a multi-speaker/multi-style model based on 8.5 hours of American English speech data which corresponds to 16 different speaker/style combinations. The results of the experiments show that both versions of the obtained system, one using 10 minutes and the other as little as 30 seconds of target data, outperform the state of the art in parametric speaker/style-dependent speech synthesis. This opens a wide range of application of speaker/style dependent speech synthesis based on small quantities of training data, in domains ranging from customer interaction in call centers to robot-assisted medical therapy.",2020,2020-04-28 00:00:00,6.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b639bd03be945409800ff769f6d22a0a4990512

Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3D printing community.",2015,2015-08-30 00:00:00,35.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80cb0bd38a588c2dfb42f1af8684b62f20476f21

Deep learning is springing up in the field of machine learning recently. By mimicking the hierarchical structure of the human brain, deep learning can gradually extract features from lower level to higher level. The Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model is a widely investigated and deployed deep learning architecture. It combines the advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning and can archive good classification performance. This study proposes a classification approach based on the DBN model for detailed urban mapping using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. Through the DBN model, effective contextual mapping features can be automatically extracted from the PolSAR data to improve the classification performance. Two-date high-resolution RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data over the Great Toronto Area were used for evaluation. Comparisons with the support vector machine (SVM), conventional neural networks (NN), and stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) were conducted to assess the potential of the DBN-based classification approach.

Plant diseases and pests are considered one of the most imperative factors influencing food production, quality, and minimize losses in production. Farmers are currently facing difficulty in identifying various plant diseases and pests, which are important to prevent plant diseases effectively in a complicated environment. The recent development of deep learning techniques has found use in the diagnosis of plant diseases and pests, providing a robust tool with highly accurate results. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature that aims to identify the state of the art of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the process of diagnosing and identification of plant pest and diseases. In addition, it presents some issues that are facing the models performance, and also indicates gaps that should be addressed in the future. In this regard, we review studies with various methods that addressed plant disease detection, dataset characteristics, the crops, and pathogens. Moreover, it discusses the commonly employed five-step methodology for plant disease recognition, involving data acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. It discusses various deep learning architecture-based solutions that have a faster convergence rate of plant disease recognition.

10.1109/TCCN.2022.3186331,A Flow-Based Anomaly Detection Approach With Feature Selection Method Against DDoS Attacks in SDNs,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network platform, which facilitates centralised network management. The SDN enables the network operators to manage the overall network consistently and holistically, regardless the complexity of infrastructure devices. The promising features of the SDN enhance network security and facilitate the implementation of threat detection systems through software applications using open APIs. However, the emerging technology creates new security concerns and new threats that do not exist in the current traditional networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) are one of the most rampant attacks that can interrupt the functionality of the network and make most of the network services unreachable for network users. The efficient identification of DDos attacks on SDN environments in literature is still a challenge because of the number of network features taken into account and the overhead of applying machine learning based anomaly detection techniques. Hence, in this paper, we aim to use two popular feature selection methods, i.e., Information Gain (IG) and Random Forest (RF) in order to analyse the most comprehensive relevant features of DDoS attacks in SDN networks. Using the most relevant features will improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection system and reduce the false alarm rates. Moreover, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) technique based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoencoder to tackle the problem of DDoS attacks in SDNs. We perform our analysis and evaluation on three different datasets, i.e., InSDN, CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018. We also measure the overhead of the proposed DL model on the SDN controller and test the network performance in terms of network throughput and end-to-end latency.

Web servers that run on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) are exposed to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A sophisticated version of this attack known as distributed denial of service (DDOS) is among the most dangerous Internet attacks, with the ability to overwhelm a web server, thereby slowing it down and potentially taking it down completely. This paper reviewed 12 recent detection of DDoS attack at the application layer published between January 2014 and December 2018.

10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3376670,A Novel Offloading Mechanism Leveraging Fuzzy Logic and Deep Reinforcement Learning to Improve IoT Application Performance in a Three-Layer Architecture Within the Fog-Cloud Environment,"This paper presents a novel offloading technique designed to enhance the efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) applications within a sophisticated three-layer architecture situated in a fog computing environment. The IoT layer contains various intelligent IoT devices that generate a large number of tasks, each characterized by distinct specifications such as size, computational demand, communication requirements, and latency constraints. owing to the limited storage and computing capacity of resource-constrained IoT devices, it is essential to offload these tasks to different layers to ensure effective processing while satisfying the required Quality of Service (QoS) goals. To address this challenge, a fuzzy logic-based task scheduler is employed to make informed offloading decisions, considering task attributes and determining the most suitable processing layers—whether locally at the IoT layer, on collaborative fog nodes, or in the cloud. Furthermore, the study leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) method, a form of deep reinforcement learning, to identify the optimal fog node for offloading tasks and to maintain a balanced workload distribution across collaborative fog nodes. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of latency, power consumption, network usage, throughput, and offloading rate in comparison with the Non-offload, First-Fit, GASDEO, and NAFITO-FLA methods.",2024,,14.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/237f834c75b54f0944f7f653b3b97ce91833d3c6

A complete IoT system includes devices, sensors, networks, software, and other essential components necessary for operation and interconnection. However, devices and sensors of this nature often have low resource requirements and multiple security vulnerabilities from manufacturers. Moreover, edge network areas of IoT systems exhibit several security weaknesses. Consequently, unauthorized hijacking of sensors or denial-of-service attacks on edge network areas can have severe consequences for the system’s operation. In this study, we propose a model that combines machine learning algorithms and principal component analysis techniques to train and predict Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Principal component analysis techniques were applied to reduce data dimensionality. We used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score as the evaluation metrics. We explain the True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, and False Negative measures as basic parts of the above evaluation metrics. Unlike previous studies, we used the Training Time to evaluate the training time of each model. We employed two datasets, CICIDS 2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS 2018, to evaluate our proposed model. In general, the proposed models exhibited the best performance and improved training time.",2023,,5.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b492f5e123ac623964755918e4512a43986a8b1b
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3251649,A Novel Security Survival Model for Quantum Key Distribution Networks Enabled by Software-Defined Networking,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technique for distributing symmetric encryption keys securely using quantum physics. The rate of key distribution is low and decreases exponentially with increasing distance. A classic trusted relay (CTR) uses additional keys to enhance security distance in QKD networks. In practice, the assurance of security for certain relay nodes is still lacking, despite the fact that CTR requires that all nodes be trusted. Owing to channel unreliability, system faults accumulate during the key relay, thereby increasing the probability of CTR failing to distribute the secret key. The failure of a successful key relay would then result in the subsequent destruction of all the keys involved in the process, which leads to the wasting of the quantum secret key and reduction system encryption. Hence, alleviating the effect of CTR failure for the purpose of obtaining key security distribution of distant quantum network is necessary issue to tackle. Therefore, a new scheme is needed in order to overcome the above-mentioned issues to come up with a better utilization of the generated keys. In this study, a software-defined networking (SDN) technique is introduced to circumvent this drawback by utilising the flexibility provided by the SDN paradigm for better QKD network management. In particular, a novel survivability model called software-defined quantum key relay failure (SDQKRF) is proposed in this paper in which a new function is developed and added to the SDN controller. According to the simulation results, SDN over a QKD network using the SDQKRF model is more reliable and performs better in terms of the key generation ratio, key utilisation rate, recovery after failure, avalanche effect, and service blocking rate than a regular QKD network without the SDQTRF model.",2023,,17.0,66.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1fb3c328ee65032b486a3cb3717c5e8d17f0d273

10.3390/s23031392,A Hybrid Generic Framework for Heart Problem Diagnosis Based on a Machine Learning Paradigm,"The early, valid prediction of heart problems would minimize life threats and save lives, while lack of prediction and false diagnosis can be fatal. Addressing a single dataset alone to build a machine learning model for the identification of heart problems is not practical because each country and hospital has its own data schema, structure, and quality. On this basis, a generic framework has been built for heart problem diagnosis. This framework is a hybrid framework that employs multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques and votes for the best outcome based on a novel voting technique with the intention to remove bias from the model. The framework contains two consequent layers. The first layer contains simultaneous machine learning models running over a given dataset. The second layer consolidates the outputs of the first layer and classifies them as a second classification layer based on novel voting techniques. Prior to the classification process, the framework selects the top features using a proposed feature selection framework. It starts by filtering the columns using multiple feature selection methods and considers the top common features selected. Results from the proposed framework, with 95.6% accuracy, show its superiority over the single machine learning model, classical stacking technique, and traditional voting technique. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate how the prediction probabilities of multiple models can be exploited for the purpose of creating another layer for final output; this step neutralizes any model bias. Another experimental contribution is proving the complete pipeline’s ability to be retrained and used for other datasets collected using different measurements and with different distributions.",2023,2023-01-26 00:00:00,16.0,49.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b1c4f516f5b669b16848797f0608d3b76f79ef0

10.1007/s11042-022-12425-x,A hybrid GA and PSO optimized approach for heart-disease prediction based on random forest,"Nowadays, heart diseases are significantly contributing to deaths all over the world. Thus, heart-disease prediction has garnered considerable attention in the medical domain globally. Accordingly, machine-learning algorithms for the early prediction of heart diseases were developed in several studies to help physicians design medical procedures. In this study, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) optimized approach based on random forest (RF), called GAPSO-RF, is developed and used to select the optimal features that can increase the accuracy of heart-disease prediction. The proposed GAPSO-RF implements multivariate statistical analysis in the first step to select the most significant features used in the initial population. After that, a discriminate mutation strategy is implemented in GA. GAPSO-RF combines a modified GA for global search and a PSO for local search. Moreover, PSO achieved the concept of rehabbing individuals that had been refused in the selection process. The performance of the proposed GAPSO-RF approach is validated via evaluation metrics, namely, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by using two datasets from the University of California, namely, Cleveland and Statlog. The experimental results confirm that the GAPSO-RF approach attained the high heart-disease-prediction accuracies of 95.6% and 91.4% on the Cleveland and Statlog datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperformed other state-of-the-art prediction methods.",2022,2022-03-08 00:00:00,83.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbd5f1f74bd0a8f62dab67125e69c7d49b61430d

In this work, the effects of prickly ash on key taste compounds in stewed sheep tail fat soup were investigated. Results showed that the taste intensity of sheep tail fat soup cooked with 0.2% prickly ash increased significantly. The concentration of organic acids and free amino acids in sheep tail fat soup significantly increased with the addition of prickly ash. The concentration of succinic acid (2.637 to 4.580 mg/g) and Thr (2.558 to 12.466 mg/g) increased the most among organic acids and amino acids, respectively. Spearman’s correlation analysis elucidated that seven taste compounds were positively correlated (correlation coefficient > 0.7) with the overall taste intensity of the soup sample including Thr, Asp, oxalic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, and ascorbic acid.

10.3390/EN10111846,Battery Energy Management in a Microgrid Using Batch Reinforcement Learning,"Motivated by recent developments in batch Reinforcement Learning (RL), this paper contributes to the application of batch RL in energy management in microgrids. We tackle the challenge of finding a closed-loop control policy to optimally schedule the operation of a storage device, in order to maximize self-consumption of local photovoltaic production in a microgrid. In this work, the fitted Q-iteration algorithm, a standard batch RL technique, is used by an RL agent to construct a control policy. The proposed method is data-driven and uses a state-action value function to find an optimal scheduling plan for a battery. The battery’s charge and discharge efficiencies, and the nonlinearity in the microgrid due to the inverter’s efficiency are taken into account. The proposed approach has been tested by simulation in a residential setting using data from Belgian residential consumers. The developed framework is benchmarked with a model-based technique, and the simulation results show a performance gap of 19%. The simulation results provide insight for developing optimal policies in more realistically-scaled and interconnected microgrids and for including uncertainties in generation and consumption for which white-box models become inaccurate and/or infeasible.",2017,2017-11-12 00:00:00,142.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e050de23b2118649885fe96a3c6cc7319b6e8ff5

10.1038/srep40437,"Comfortable, high-efficiency heat pump with desiccant-coated, water-sorbing heat exchangers","Comfortable, efficient, and affordable heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings are highly desirable due to the demands of energy efficiency and environmental friendliness. Traditional vapor-compression air conditioners exhibit a lower coefficient of performance (COP) (typically 2.8–3.8) owing to the cooling-based dehumidification methods that handle both sensible and latent loads together. Temperature- and humidity-independent control or desiccant systems have been proposed to overcome these challenges; however, the COP of current desiccant systems is quite small and additional heat sources are usually needed. Here, we report on a desiccant-enhanced, direct expansion heat pump based on a water-sorbing heat exchanger with a desiccant coating that exhibits an ultrahigh COP value of more than 7 without sacrificing any comfort or compactness. The pump’s efficiency is doubled compared to that of pumps currently used in conventional room air conditioners, which is a revolutionary HVAC breakthrough. Our proposed water-sorbing heat exchanger can independently handle sensible and latent loads at the same time. The desiccants adsorb moisture almost isothermally and can be regenerated by condensation heat. This new approach opens up the possibility of achieving ultrahigh efficiency for a broad range of temperature- and humidity-control applications.",2017,2017-01-12 00:00:00,108.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02ff817868c0a31d9ba091d11e52186bb857a508

This paper presents a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) self-tuning temperature sensing and control system for efficiently modulating the temperature environment within a multi-module instrument. The smart system ensures that the internal temperature of the instrument converges to a target without the need of a system model, thus making the control robust. The system consists of a fully-connected proportional–integral–derivative (PID) neural network (FCPIDNN) and an on-line self-tuning module. The experimental results show that the presented system can effectively control the internal temperature under various mission scenarios, in particular, it is able to self-reconfigure upon actuator failure. The system provides a new scheme for a complex and time-variant MIMO control system which can be widely applied for the distributed measurement and control of the environment in instruments, integration electronics, and house constructions.",2016,2016-10-01 00:00:00,6.0,20.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9ecf47e17a8d890884c94eae4995db47a83cf06

10.1186/s40708-019-0096-3,The role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in harmonization of high-resolution post-mortem MRI (virtopsy) with respect to brain microstructure,"Enhanced resolution of 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners has considerably advanced our knowledge of structure and function in human and animal brains. Post-industrialized countries are particularly prone to an ever-increasing number of ageing individuals and ageing-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with volume loss in the affected brain. MRI diagnoses and monitoring of subtle volume changes in the ageing/diseased brains have the potential to become standard diagnostic tools. Even with the superior resolution of 7 T MRI scanners, the microstructural changes comprising cell types, cell numbers, and cellular processes, are still undetectable. Knowledge of origin, nature, and progression for microstructural changes are necessary to understand pathogenetic stages in the relentless neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to develop therapeutic tools that delay or stop neurodegenerative processes at their earliest stage. We illustrate the gap in resolution by comparing the identical regions of the post-mortem in situ 7 T MR images (virtual autopsy or virtopsy) with the histological observations in serial sections through the same brain. We also described the protocols and limitations associated with these comparisons, as well as the necessity of supercomputers and data management for “Big data”. Analysis of neuron and/or glial number by using a body of mathematical tools and guidelines (stereology) is time-consuming, cumbersome, and still restricted to trained human investigators. Development of tools based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) could considerably accelerate studies on localization, onset, and progression of neuron loss. Finally, these observations could disentangle the mechanisms of volume loss into stages of reversible atrophy and/or irreversible fatal cell death. This AI- and ML-based cooperation between virtopsy and histology could bridge the present gap between virtual reality and neuropathology. It could also culminate in the creation of an imaging-associated comprehensive database. This database would include genetic, clinical, epidemiological, and technical aspects that could help to alleviate or even stop the adverse effects of neurodegenerative diseases on affected individuals, their families, and society.",2019,2019-03-07 00:00:00,26.0,102.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b54c83ed54980b76cd29b594ea039c9da1de271

The breadth of existing information sources, and their equivalent sensors, can provide a wealth of data which, to be useful, must be transformed into actionable knowledge. Approaches based on Information Communication Technologies (ICT) have been shown to be able to help farmers and related stakeholders make decisions on problems by examining large volumes of data while assessing multiple criteria. In this paper, we address the automated identification (and count the instances) of the major threat of olive trees and their fruit, the Bactrocera Oleae (a.k.a. Dacus) based on images of the commonly used McPhail trap’s contents. Accordingly, we introduce the “Dacus Image Recognition Toolkit” (DIRT), a collection of publicly available data, programming code samples and web-services focused at supporting research aiming at the management the Dacus as well as extensive experimentation on the capability of the proposed dataset in identifying Dacuses using Deep Learning methods. Experimental results indicated performance accuracy (mAP) of 91.52% in identifying Dacuses in trap images featuring various pests. Moreover, the results also indicated a trade-off between image attributes affecting detail, file size and complexity of approaches and mAP performance that can be selectively used to better tackle the needs of each usage scenario.",2018,2018-10-30 00:00:00,36.0,30.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8442395e323a6ff875755682c174ed75b7320c6

This result indicates the possibility that BERT networks capture structural information about language. In this work, we provide novel support for this claim by performing a series of experiments to unpack the elements of English language structure learned by BERT. Our findings are fourfold. BERT’s phrasal representation captures the phrase-level information in the lower layers. The intermediate layers of BERT compose a rich hierarchy of linguistic information, starting with surface features at the bottom, syntactic features in the middle followed by semantic features at the top. BERT requires deeper layers while tracking subject-verb agreement to handle long-term dependency problem.

We test this algorithm with independent, clinical notes and achieve high predictive accuracy 12 hours before the onset of sepsis (AUC 0.94, sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.87). We compare the SERA algorithm against physician predictions and show the algorithm’s potential to increase the early detection of sepsis by up to 32% and reduce false positives by up to 17%. Mining unstructured clinical notes is shown to improve the algorithm’s accuracy compared to using only clinical measures for early warning 12 to 48 hours before the onset of sepsis.

Molecular approaches such as reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers highly sensitive and specific means to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, however, despite it being the accepted “gold standard”, molecular platforms often require a tradeoff between speed versus throughput. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)—time of flight (TOF)—mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed as a potential solution for COVID-19 testing and finding a balance between analytical performance, speed, and throughput, without relying on impacted supply chains. Combined with machine learning (ML), this MALDI-TOF-MS approach could overcome logistical barriers encountered by current testing paradigms. We evaluated the analytical performance of an ML-enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS method for screening COVID-19. Residual nasal swab samples from adult volunteers were used for testing and compared against RT-PCR. Two optimized ML models were identified, exhibiting accuracy of 98.3%, positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100%, negative percent agreement (NPA) of 96%, and accuracy of 96.6%, PPA of 98.5%, and NPA of 94% respectively.

Clinical decisions including prescription and timing of antibiotics, ordering of additional diagnostics and level-of-care decisions rely on understanding etiology and implications of a clinical presentation. Host mRNA signatures can differentiate infectious from noninfectious etiologies, bacterial from viral infections, and predict 30-day mortality. The 29-host-mRNA blood-based InSepTM test (Inflammatix, Burlingame, CA, formerly known as HostDxTM Sepsis) combines machine learning algorithms with a rapid point-of-care platform with less than 30 min turnaround time to enable rapid diagnosis of acute infections and sepsis, as well as prediction of disease severity. A scientific advisory panel including emergency medicine, infectious disease, intensive care and clinical pathology physicians discussed technical and clinical requirements in preparation of successful introduction of InSep into the market. Topics included intended use; patient populations of greatest need; patient journey and sample flow in the emergency department (ED) and beyond; clinical and biomarker-based decision algorithms; performance characteristics for clinical utility; assay and instrument requirements; and result readouts. The panel identified clear demand for a solution like InSep, requirements regarding test performance and interpretability, and a need for focused medical education due to the innovative but complex nature of the result readout.

Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) technology is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. ABSTRACT Highly accurate testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the point of care (POC) is an unmet diagnostic need in emergency care and time-sensitive outpatient care settings. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) technology is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

However, virological relapse (VR) occurs in most patients. We aimed to analyze soluble immune markers (SIMs) and use machine learning to identify SIM combinations as predictor for early VR after NA discontinuation. A validation cohort was used to verify the predictive power of the SIM combination. In a post hoc analysis of a prospective, multicenter therapeutic vaccination trial (ABX‐203, NCT02249988), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antigen, and 47 SIMs were repeatedly determined before NA was stopped. Forty‐three HBeAg‐negative patients were included. To detect the highest predictive constellation of host and viral markers, a supervised machine learning approach was used. Data were validated in a different cohort of 49 patients treated with entecavir. VR (hepatitis B virus DNA ≥ 2,000 IU/mL) occurred in 27 patients. The predictive value for VR of single SIMs at the time of NA stop was best for interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐17, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5) with a maximum area under the curve of 0.65. Hepatitis B core antigen had a higher predictive power than hepatitis B surface antigen but lower than the SIMs. A supervised machine‐learning algorithm allowed a remarkable improvement of early relapse prediction in patients treated with entecavir. The combination of IL‐2, monokine induced by interferon γ (MIG)/chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 9 (CCL9), RANTES/CCL5, stem cell factor (SCF), and TNF‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand (TRAIL) was reliable in predicting VR (0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.5‐1.0) and showed viable results in the validation cohort (0.63; 0.1‐0.99). Host immune markers such as SIMs appear to be underestimated in guiding treatment cessation in HBeAg‐negative patients.

10.5220/0010215303190328,Explainable Sentiment Analysis Application for Social Media Crisis Management in Retail,"Sentiment Analysis techniques enable the automatic extraction of sentiment in social media data, including popular platforms as Twitter. For retailers and marketing analysts, such methods can support the understanding of customers' attitudes towards brands, especially to handle crises that cause behavioural changes in customers, including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the increasing adoption of black-box machine learning-based techniques, transparency becomes a need for those stakeholders to understand why a given sentiment is predicted, which is rarely explored for retailers facing social media crises. This study develops an Explainable Sentiment Analysis (XSA) application for Twitter data, and proposes research propositions focused on evaluating such application in a hypothetical crisis management scenario. Particularly, we evaluate, through discussions and a simulated user experiment, the XSA support for understanding customer's needs, as well as if marketing analysts would trust such an application for their decision-making processes. Results illustrate the XSA application can be effective in providing the most important words addressing customers sentiment out of individual tweets, as well as the potential to foster analysts' confidence in such support.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3030184,"Crisis Informatics in the Context of Social Media Crisis Communication: Theoretical Models, Taxonomy, and Open Issues","The involvement application and use of crisis and emergency management and communication are increasing rapidly. This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the development of theoretical models in the area of social media crisis communication and management. The study aims to review and analyse the relationship of social media-based crisis communication in the context of crisis informatics and its taxonomy and the related crisis communication theoretical models to derive the challenges and limitations. A total of 207 articles were selected for the evaluation based on quality, relevancy, and contribution. The findings revealed that the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) is the most dominant theory, followed by social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) and integrated crisis mapping (ICM) models. The study identified theories such as the STREMII model, social media crisis management matrix/framework (SMSMF), and an interactive crisis communication model (ICCM) as emerging models. Moreover, the result of the finding shows that stakeholder interaction is an understudied field, while information reliability and processing for decision-making purposes, the wider application of social media sites, privacy issues, and how social media interaction can improve community resilience or build stakeholders relationships remain suitable topics for future research.",2020,2020-10-12 00:00:00,37.0,180.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a05cc6bbe7d12298e61eb1332db271d1ed832a1

10.1073/pnas.2003162117,Autonomics: In search of a foundation for next-generation autonomous systems,"Significance Autonomous systems are replacing humans in a variety of tasks, and in the years to come, such systems will become central and crucial to human life. They will include vehicles of all kinds, medical and industrial robots, agricultural and manufacturing facilities, traffic management systems, and much more. While many organizations strive to develop the next generation of trustworthy, cost-effective autonomous systems, a major gap exists between the challenges in developing these and the state of the art. There is a crucial need for a common scientific and engineering foundation for developing these systems, which we term “autonomics.” We believe that such a foundation will dramatically accelerate the deployment and acceptance of high-quality autonomous systems, for the benefit of human society. The potential benefits of autonomous systems are obvious. However, there are still major issues to be dealt with before developing such systems becomes a commonplace engineering practice, with accepted and trustworthy deliverables. We argue that a solid, evolving, publicly available, community-controlled foundation for developing next-generation autonomous systems is a must, and term the desired foundation “autonomics.” We focus on three main challenges: 1) how to specify autonomous system behavior in the face of unpredictability; 2) how to carry out faithful analysis of system behavior with respect to rich environments that include humans, physical artifacts, and other systems; and 3) how to build such systems by combining executable modeling techniques from software engineering with artificial intelligence and machine learning.",2019,2019-11-17 00:00:00,50.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/779f047d6340bec1048d8f0679bc5543ce148ad8

In parallel, a method to optimize the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of PET detectors by use of the DOI information is proposed and tested. For these purposes, a dedicated 64-channels readout setup has been developed with intrinsic timing resolution of 16 ps FWHM. Several PET modules have been produced, based on LYSO:Ce scintillators and commercial silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays, with mm2 individual SiPM size. The results show the possibility to achieve a timing resolution of 157 ps FWHM, combined with the already demonstrated spatial resolution of 1.5 mm FWHM, DOI resolution of 3 mm FWHM, and energy resolution of 9% FWHM at 511 keV, with 15 mm long crystals of section mm2 and mm2.

Monoliths provide good energy, timing, and spatial resolution including intrinsic depth of interaction (DOI) encoding. DOI allows reducing parallax errors (radial astigmatism) at off-center positions within a PET ring. We present a novel DOI-estimation approach based on the supervised machine learning algorithm gradient tree boosting (GTB). GTB builds predictive regression models based on sequential binary comparisons (decision trees). GTB models have been shown to be implementable in FPGA if the memory requirement fits the available resources. We propose two optimization scenarios for the best possible positioning performance: One restricting the available memory to enable a future FPGA implementation and one without any restrictions. The positioning performance of the GTB models is compared with a DOI estimation method based on a single DOI observable (SO) comparable to other methods presented in literature. For a 12 mm high monolith, we achieve an averaged spatial resolution of 2.15 mm and 2.12 mm FWHM for SO and GTB models, respectively. In contrast to SO models, GTB models show a nearly uniform positioning performance over the whole crystal depth.",2018,2018-08-20 00:00:00,68.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af3e9d8282e34f6eed148d30eb9032855d59b312
10.1002/mp.12906,"An edge‐readout, multilayer detector for positron emission tomography","Purpose We present a novel gamma‐ray‐detector design based on total internal reflection (TIR) of scintillation photons within a crystal that addresses many limitations of traditional PET detectors. Our approach has appealing features, including submillimeter lateral resolution, DOI positioning from layer thickness, and excellent energy resolution. The design places light sensors on the edges of a stack of scintillator slabs separated by small air gaps and exploits the phenomenon that more than 80% of scintillation light emitted during a gamma‐ray event reaches the edges of a thin crystal with polished faces due to TIR. Gamma‐ray stopping power is achieved by stacking multiple layers, and DOI is determined by which layer the gamma ray interacts in. Method The concept of edge readouts of a thin slab was verified by Monte Carlo simulation of scintillation light transport. An LYSO crystal of dimensions 50.8 mm × 50.8 mm × 3.0 mm was modeled with five rectangular SiPMs placed along each edge face. The mean‐detector‐response functions (MDRFs) were calculated by simulating signals from 511 keV gamma‐ray interactions in a grid of locations. Simulations were carried out to study the influence of choice of scintillator material and dimensions, gamma‐ray photon energies, introduction of laser or mechanically induced optical barriers (LIOBs, MIOBs), and refractive indices of optical‐coupling media and SiPM windows. We also analyzed timing performance including influence of gamma‐ray interaction position and presence of optical barriers. We also modeled and built a prototype detector, a 27.4 mm × 27.4 mm × 3.0 mm CsI(Tl) crystal with 4 SiPMs per edge to experimentally validate the results predicted by the simulations. The prototype detector used CsI(Tl) crystals from Proteus outfitted with 16 Hamamatsu model S13360‐6050PE MPPCs read out by an AiT‐16‐channel readout. The MDRFs were measured by scanning the detector with a collimated beam of 662‐keV photons from a 137Cs source. The spatial resolution was experimentally determined by imaging a tungsten slit that created a beam of 0.44 mm (FWHM) width normal to the detector surface. The energy resolution was evaluated by analyzing list‐mode data from flood illumination by the 137Cs source. Result We find that in a block‐detector‐sized LYSO layer read out by five SiPMs per edge, illuminated by 511‐keV photons, the average resolution is 1.49 mm (FWHM). With the introduction of optical barriers, average spatial resolution improves to 0.56 mm (FWHM). The DOI resolution is the layer thickness of 3.0 mm. We also find that optical‐coupling media and SiPM‐window materials have an impact on spatial resolution. The timing simulation with LYSO crystal yields a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of 200–400 ps, which is slightly position dependent. And the introduction of optical barriers has minimum influence. The prototype CsI(Tl) detector, with a smaller area and fewer SiPMs, was measured to have central‐area spatial resolutions of 0.70 and 0.39 mm without and with optical barriers, respectively. These results match well with our simulations. An energy resolution of 6.4% was achieved at 662 keV. Conclusion A detector design based on a stack of monolithic scintillator layers that uses edge readouts offers several advantages over current block detectors for PET. For example, there is no tradeoff between spatial resolution and detection sensitivity since no reflector material displaces scintillator crystal, and submillimeter resolution can be achieved. DOI information is readily available, and excellent timing and energy resolutions are possible.",2018,2018-05-06 00:00:00,26.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6236a56c9ffaa3f96c17b90e3f93cf1604db8aec

Recently we developed a new method to obtain the DOI function for a single side readout PET module, recirculating the scintillation light in the matrix by means of a mirror placed on top of the module. In a complete PET scanner, periodical DOI calibrations have to be performed to prevent time dependent miscalibrations and performance degradations. The current DOI calibration relies on a coincidence system between the module and an external scintillator to provide a priori the DOI information and it is clearly not feasible in a real system without unpractical disassemblies of the scanner. In this paper we develop instead a fast and precise calibration method based on uniform irradiation of the scintillators. Three irradiation modalities are presented, in particular one where the source is placed on top of the module, one with the source placed on one side of the module and one that exploits the internal radioactivity of the scintillator. The three different procedures are evaluated and the calibration method is validated by comparing the information provided by the coincidence setup.",2016,2016-11-24 00:00:00,8.0,8.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08ae151eb90480e388a5cf2d2370304e7e187f1f

10.1130/geol.s.12777605.v1,Stagnant slab front within the mantle transition zone controls the formation of Cenozoic intracontinental high-Mg andesites in northeast Asia,"
 The geochemistry of Cenozoic intracontinental high-Mg andesites (HMAs) in northeast Asia, together with regional geophysical data, offers an opportunity to explore the genetic relationship between the formation of intracontinental HMAs and subduction of the Pacific plate. Compared with primary HMAs in arcs, Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia have lower Mg# [100 × Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)] values (53–56) and CaO contents (5.8–6.6 wt%), higher alkali (Na2O + K2O) contents (5.15–6.45 wt%), and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7056–0.7059; εNd = −4.9 to −3.4; εHf = −4.7 to −2.6) as well as lower Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb = 16.76–19.19; 207Pb/204Pb = 15.42–15.45; 208Pb/204Pb = 36.71–37.11). These Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs are similar to Cenozoic potassic basalts in northeast China with respect to their Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions but have higher SiO2 and Al2O3 contents and lower K2O, MgO, and light rare earth element contents. These features indicate that these Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs originated from the mantle, where recycled ancient sediments and water contributed to partial melting of peridotite. Combined with the presence of a large low-resistivity anomaly derived from the mantle transition zone (MTZ) near these intracontinental HMAs, and their occurrence above the stagnant slab front within the MTZ (at 600 km depth) in northeast Asia, we conclude that the stagnant slab front, with high contents of recycled ancient sediments and water, has controlled the formation of Cenozoic intracontinental HMAs in northeast Asia.",2020,2020-08-07 00:00:00,28.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66321fdb93bf434ec9c06ee861babb5ade224052

A rigorous approach to observational studies involves collecting data from different sensors to comprehensively capture the situation of the subject. However, this leads to technical difficulties especially if the sensors are from different manufacturers, as multiple data collection tools have to run simultaneously. We present SensorHub, a system that can collect data from various wearable devices from different manufacturers, such as inertial measurement units, portable electrocardiographs, portable electroencephalographs, portable photoplethysmographs, and sensors for electrodermal activity. Additionally, our tool offers the possibility to include ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in studies. Hence, SensorHub enables multimodal sensor data collection under real-world conditions and allows direct user feedback to be collected through questionnaires, enabling studies at home. In a first study with 11 participants, we successfully used SensorHub to record multiple signals with different devices and collected additional information with the help of EMAs. In addition, we evaluated SensorHub’s technical capabilities in several trials with up to 21 participants recording simultaneously using multiple sensors with sampling frequencies as high as 1000 Hz. We could show that although there is a theoretical limitation to the transmissible data rate, in practice this limitation is not an issue and data loss is rare. We conclude that with modern communication protocols and with the increasingly powerful smartphones and wearables, a system like our SensorHub establishes an interoperability framework to adequately combine consumer-grade sensing hardware which enables observational studies in real life.",2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,9.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c755a82f0bf7d2495dc890bedf631d4fa8b896b

In particular, physiological signals are widely used to detect and classify affective states in lab conditions. However, physiological reactions to emotional stimuli have been found to differ in laboratory and natural settings. Thanks to recent technological progress (e.g., in wearables) the creation of EMSR systems for a large number of consumers during their everyday activities is increasingly possible. Therefore, datasets created in the wild are needed to insure the validity and the exploitability of EMSR models for real-life applications. In this paper, we initially present common techniques used in laboratory settings to induce emotions for the purpose of physiological dataset creation. Next, advantages and challenges of data collection in the wild are discussed. To assess the applicability of existing datasets to real-life applications, we propose a set of categories to guide and compare at a glance different methodologies used by researchers to collect such data. For this purpose, we also introduce a visual tool called Graphical Assessment of Real-life Application-Focused Emotional Dataset (GARAFED). In the last part of the paper, we apply the proposed tool to compare existing physiological datasets for EMSR in the wild and to show possible improvements and future directions of research. We wish for this paper and GARAFED to be used as guidelines for researchers and developers who aim at collecting affect-related data for real-life EMSR-based applications.",2020,2020-07-15 00:00:00,83.0,180.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7649125c1f7299e32dffc1856b899b0b793736bf

Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.",2020,2020-01-02 00:00:00,3699.0,116.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/44858b662822d291a5e1e9e3501ad19a9f1572c2

However, other types of data to which these models can be applied have not yet been explored as thoroughly. Labelling is an indispensable stage of data pre-processing that can be particularly challenging, especially when applied to single or multi-model real-time sensor data collection approaches. Currently, real-time sensor data labelling is an unwieldy process, with a limited range of tools available and poor performance characteristics, which can lead to the performance of the machine learning models being compromised. In this paper, we introduce new techniques for labelling at the point of collection coupled with a pilot study and a systematic performance comparison of two popular types of deep neural networks running on five custom built devices and a comparative mobile app (68.5–89% accuracy within-device GRU model, 92.8% highest LSTM model accuracy).

10.3390/info13060303,LoRaWAN Based Indoor Localization Using Random Neural Networks,"Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are frequently used as a potential solution for localization applications. However, GPS does not work indoors due to a lack of direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) satellite signals received from the End Device (ED) due to thick solid materials blocking the ultra-high frequency signals. Furthermore, fingerprint localization using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values is typical for localization in indoor environments. Therefore, this paper develops a low-power intelligent localization system for indoor environments using Long-Range Wide-Area Networks (LoRaWAN) RSSI values with Random Neural Networks (RNN). The proposed localization system demonstrates 98.5% improvement in average localization error compared to related studies with a minimum average localization error of 0.12 m in the Line-of-Sight (LOS). The obtained results confirm LoRaWAN-RNN-based localization systems suitable for indoor environments in LOS applied in big sports halls, hospital wards, shopping malls, airports, and many more with the highest accuracy of 99.52%. Furthermore, a minimum average localization error of 13.94 m was obtained in the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenario, and this result is appropriate for the management and control of vehicles in indoor car parks, industries, or any other fleet in a pre-defined area in the NLOS with the highest accuracy of 44.24%.",2022,2022-06-16 00:00:00,14.0,23.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b8596728aebc1f5ae0bf3c5a0186e04116e3b620

In this paper, we present printed sensor antennas for the [862–928] MHz band supporting LoRa and Sigfox and the [2.4–2.5] GHz band for WiFi, Bluetooth, and IEEE802.15.4 communication. To integrate them into smart suitcases, the antennas are printed, overmolded, tested, and measured, following a dedicated conformal integration strategy consisting of two design iterations. Additionally, as a more convenient connection to the printed antennas, printed transmission lines along with a dedicated transition to printed circuit board technologies are implemented and characterized, avoiding rigid coaxial connectors that exhibit fragile mounting on flexible substrates. The overmolded stand-alone antennas achieve fractional impedance bandwidths of 26% and 15% covering the [862–928] MHz and [2.4–2.5] GHz bands, respectively, with a substantial margin and with in-band simulated total efficiencies of 94% and 88%, respectively.

Our method combines a unique problem representation and an unbiased optimization protocol to learn from mirBase19.0 an accurate predictive model, termed MiRduplexSVM. This is the first model that provides precise information about all four ends of the miRNA duplex. We show that (a) our method outperforms four state-of-the-art tools, namely MaturePred, MiRPara, MatureBayes, MiRdup as well as a Simple Geometric Locator when applied on the same training datasets employed for each tool and evaluated on a common blind test set. (b) In all comparisons, MiRduplexSVM shows superior performance, achieving up to a 60% increase in prediction accuracy for mammalian hairpins and can generalize very well on plant hairpins, without any special optimization. (c) The tool has a number of important applications such as the ability to accurately predict the miRNA or the miRNA*, given the opposite strand of a duplex. Its performance on this task is superior to the 2nts overhang rule commonly used in computational studies and similar to that of a comparative genomic approach, without the need for prior knowledge or the complexity of performing multiple alignments. Finally, it is able to evaluate novel, potential miRNAs found either computationally or experimentally. In relation with recent confidence evaluation methods used in miRBase, MiRduplexSVM was successful in identifying high confidence potential miRNAs.",2015,2015-05-11 00:00:00,22.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28fa3c4c027a731b111089b5d21b55207ebad363
10.1186/s12859-014-0423-x,Prediction of plant pre-microRNAs and their microRNAs in genome-scale sequences using structure-sequence features and support vector machine,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of non-coding RNAs approximately 21 nucleotides in length that play pivotal roles at the post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and viruses. These molecules silence their target genes by degrading transcription or suppressing translation. Studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in biological responses to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Identification of these molecules and their targets can aid the understanding of regulatory processes. Recently, prediction methods based on machine learning have been widely used for miRNA prediction. However, most of these methods were designed for mammalian miRNA prediction, and few are available for predicting miRNAs in the pre-miRNAs of specific plant species. Although the complete Solanum lycopersicum genome has been published, only 77 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs have been identified, far less than the estimated number. Therefore, it is essential to develop a prediction method based on machine learning to identify new plant miRNAs. A novel classification model based on a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to identify real and pseudo plant pre-miRNAs together with their miRNAs. An initial set of 152 novel features related to sequential structures was used to train the model. By applying feature selection, we obtained the best subset of 47 features for use with the Back Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (B-SVM-RFE) method for the classification of plant pre-miRNAs. Using this method, 63 features were obtained for plant miRNA classification. We then developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, which comprises MiPlantPre and MiPlantMat, to identify plant pre-miRNAs and their miRNAs. This model achieved approximately 90% accuracy using plant datasets from nine plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens, Medicago truncatula, Sorghum bicolor, Arabidopsis lyrata, Zea mays and Solanum lycopersicum. Using miPlantPreMat, 522 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs were identified in the Solanum lycopersicum genome sequence. We developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, based on structure-sequence features and SVM. MiPlantPreMat was used to identify both plant pre-miRNAs and the corresponding mature miRNAs. An improved feature selection method was proposed, resulting in high classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.",2014,2014-12-01 00:00:00,33.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/363c760e9905ce5ebeb3bc2de5521cce24d2739b

10.1093/nar/gkt466,Computational prediction of the localization of microRNAs within their pre-miRNA,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA species derived from hairpin-forming miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) and acting as key posttranscriptional regulators. Most computational tools labeled as miRNA predictors are in fact pre-miRNA predictors and provide no information about the putative miRNA location within the pre-miRNA. Sequence and structural features that determine the location of the miRNA, and the extent to which these properties vary from species to species, are poorly understood. We have developed miRdup, a computational predictor for the identification of the most likely miRNA location within a given pre-miRNA or the validation of a candidate miRNA. MiRdup is based on a random forest classifier trained with experimentally validated miRNAs from miRbase, with features that characterize the miRNA–miRNA* duplex. Because we observed that miRNAs have sequence and structural properties that differ between species, mostly in terms of duplex stability, we trained various clade-specific miRdup models and obtained increased accuracy. MiRdup self-trains on the most recent version of miRbase and is easy to use. Combined with existing pre-miRNA predictors, it will be valuable for both de novo mapping of miRNAs and filtering of large sets of candidate miRNAs obtained from transcriptome sequencing projects.

10.1093/nar/gkt426,CoRAL: predicting non-coding RNAs from small RNA-sequencing data,"The surprising observation that virtually the entire human genome is transcribed means we know little about the function of many emerging classes of RNAs, except their astounding diversities. Traditional RNA function prediction methods rely on sequence or alignment information, which are limited in their abilities to classify the various collections of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). To address this, we developed Classification of RNAs by Analysis of Length (CoRAL), a machine learning-based approach for classification of RNA molecules. CoRAL uses biologically interpretable features including fragment length and cleavage specificity to distinguish between different ncRNA populations. We evaluated CoRAL using genome-wide small RNA sequencing data sets from four human tissue types and were able to classify six different types of RNAs with ∼80% cross-validation accuracy. Analysis by CoRAL revealed that microRNAs, small nucleolar and transposon-derived RNAs are highly discernible and consistent across all human tissue types assessed, whereas long intergenic ncRNAs, small cytoplasmic RNAs and small nuclear RNAs show less consistent patterns. The ability to reliably annotate loci across tissue types demonstrates the potential of CoRAL to characterize ncRNAs using small RNA sequencing data in less well-characterized organisms.",2013,2013-05-21 00:00:00,28.0,31.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0689184d274c4106fffc90be0bae58c530607a0b
10.1371/journal.pone.0051673,MiRmat: Mature microRNA Sequence Prediction,"Background MicroRNAs are known to be generated from primary transcripts mainly through the sequential cleavages by two enzymes, Drosha and Dicer. The sequence of a mature microRNA, especially the ‘seeding sequence’, largely determines its binding ability and specificity to target mRNAs. Therefore, methods that predict mature microRNA sequences with high accuracy will benefit the identification and characterization of novel microRNAs and their targets, and contribute to inferring the post-transcriptional regulation network at a genome scale. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed a method, MiRmat, to predict the mature microRNA sequence. MiRmat is essentially composed of two parts: the prediction of Drosha processing site and the identification of Dicer processing site. Based on the analysis of microRNAs from 12 species, we found that the patterns of free energy profiles are conserved among vertebrate microRNA hairpins. Therefore, we introduced in our method the free energy distribution pattern of the downstream part of pri-microRNA secondary structure and Random Forest algorithm to predict the mature microRNA sequence. Based on the evaluation on an independent test dataset from 10 vertebrates, MiRmat was shown to identify 77.8% of the Drosha processing sites and 92.8% of the Dicer sites within a deviation of 2 nt. In a more stringent evaluation by excluding the microRNAs sharing the same family between the training set and test set, MiRmat kept a rather well performance of 71.9% and 87.2% of the identification rate on the Drosha and Dicer site respectively, which represents the ability to deal with the novel microRNA family. MiRmat outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has a high degree of efficacy for the prediction of mature microRNA sequences of vertebrates. Conclusion MiRmat was developed for identifying microRNA mature sequence(s) by introducing the free energy distribution of RNA stem-loop structure and the Random Forest algorithm. We prove that MiRmat has better performance than the existing tools and is applicable among vertebrates.

The canonical microRNA pathway starts with transcription from DNA and is followed by processing via the microprocessor complex, yielding a hairpin structure. Which is then exported into the cytosol where it is processed by Dicer and then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex. All of these biogenesis steps add to the overall specificity of miRNA production and effect. Unfortunately, their modes of action are just beginning to be elucidated and therefore computational prediction algorithms cannot model the process but are usually forced to employ machine learning approaches.

10.18632/oncotarget.27617,Profiling the circulating mRNA transcriptome in human liver disease,"The human circulation contains cell-free DNA and non-coding microRNA (miRNA). Less is known about the presence of messenger RNA (mRNA). This report profiles the human circulating mRNA transcriptome in people with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to determine whether mRNA analytes can be used as biomarkers of liver disease. Using RNAseq and RT-qPCR, we investigate circulating mRNA in plasma from HCC and LC patients and demonstrate detection of transcripts representing more than 19,000 different protein coding genes. Remarkably, the circulating mRNA expression levels were similar from person to person over the 21 individuals whose samples were analyzed by RNAseq. Liver derived circulating transcripts such as albumin (ALB), apolipoprotein (APO) A1, A2 & H, serpin A1 & E1, ferritin light chain (FTL) and fibrinogen like 1 (FGL1) were significantly upregulated in HCC patient samples. Higher levels of some of these liver-specific transcripts in the plasma of HCC patients were confirmed by RT-qPCR in another cohort of 20 individuals. Several less abundant circulating transcripts associated with cancer were detected in most HCC samples, but not in healthy subjects. Liver specificity of circulating transcripts was confirmed by investigating their expression in HCC tumor and liver cancer cell lines. Liver specific mRNA sequences in the plasma were predominantly present outside circulating extracellular vesicles. Conclusions: The circulating “mRNA” transcriptome is remarkably consistent in diversity and expression from person to person. Detection of transcripts corresponding to disease selective polypeptides suggests the possibility that circulating mRNA can work as a biomarker analyte for cancer detection.",2020,2020-06-09 00:00:00,15.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f52e07618c6788c075897d18417992bc5eb78b37

Many targets of PARP-1/2-dependent PARylation are involved in the DNA damage response and hence, the loss of these proteins disrupts a wide range of biological processes, from DNA repair and epigenetics to telomere and centromere regulation. The central role of these PARPs in DNA metabolism in cancer cells has led to the development of PARP inhibitors as new cancer therapeutics, both as adjuvant treatment potentiating chemo-, radio-, and immuno-therapies and as monotherapy exploiting cancer-specific defects in DNA repair. However, a cancer is not just made up of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment also includes multiple other cell types, particularly stromal and immune cells. Interactions between these cells—cancerous and non-cancerous—are known to either favor or limit tumorigenesis. In recent years, an important role of PARP-1 and PARP-2 has been demonstrated in different aspects of the immune response, modulating both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is now emerging that PARP-1 and PARP-2 may not only impact cancer cell biology, but also modulate the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the immunomodulatory roles of PARP-1 and PARP-2 may provide invaluable clues to the rational development of more selective PARP-centered therapies which target both the cancer and its microenvironment.",2020,2020-02-01 00:00:00,57.0,104.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fec9e1e31cae4fe5f17ec2a08b83ebb8f066dd29

Immune checkpoint inhibitors that augment adaptive immunity have been tested in HCC. Complex interactions between tumor cells, lymphocytes and the tumor environment determine the efficacy of such immunotherapies. Innate immune mechanisms – known drivers of liver disease progression in pre-HCC conditions such as fibrosis or cirrhosis – may either support or counteract tumor-related immune activation.

10.1186/s12885-019-6489-0,Diagnostic value of plasma HSP90α levels for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide. However, the popular tumor marker, AFP, lacks sensitivity although its specificity is high. Tissue biopsy is an invasive operation and may increase the risk of needle-track metastases. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. This study aims to determine whether levels of plasma HSP90α in HCC patients can be used as a cost-effective and simple test for the initial diagnosis of the disease. Plasma samples were collected from 659 HCC patients, 114 secondary hepatic carcinoma (SHC) patients, 28 hepatic hemangioma patients and 230 healthy donors. The levels of HSP90α were measured by ELISA. The levels of plasma HSP90α in HCC patients were significantly higher than in healthy donors and in patients with hepatic hemangioma or SHC (144.08 ± 4.98, 46.81 ± 1.11, 61.56 ± 8.20 and 111.96 ± 10.08 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.05 in all cases). The levels were associated with age (p = 0.001), BCLC stage (p < 0.001), levels of AFP (p < 0.001), tumor size (p < 0.001), tumor number (p < 0.001), PVTT (p < 0.001), EHM (p < 0.001) and Child-Pugh stage in the HCC cohort. In addition, the levels of plasma HSP90α showed an upward trend along with the progression of the BCLC stage. ROC curve analysis showed that compared to AFP (AUC 0.922, 95%CI 0.902–0.938) or HSP90α (AUC 0.836, 95%CI 0.810–0.860), the combination of HSP90α and AFP (AUC0.943, 95%CI 0.925–0.957) significantly improved the diagnostic efficiency for HCC patients.

The use of non-verbal cues such as gestures, body movement, and facial expressions convey the feeling and the feedback to the user. This discipline of Human–Computer Interaction places reliance on the algorithmic robustness and the sensitivity of the sensor to ameliorate the recognition. Sensors play a significant role in accurate detection by providing a very high-quality input, hence increasing the efficiency and the reliability of the system. Automatic recognition of human emotions would help in teaching social intelligence in the machines. This paper presents a brief study of the various approaches and the techniques of emotion recognition. The survey covers a succinct review of the databases that are considered as data sets for algorithms detecting the emotions by facial expressions. Later, mixed reality device Microsoft HoloLens (MHL) is introduced for observing emotion recognition in Augmented Reality (AR). A brief introduction of its sensors, their application in emotion recognition and some preliminary results of emotion recognition using MHL are presented.

PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG “combo” pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting “clean” PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment.

Various machine learning algorithms were applied to the body weight ratio measured by the developed SPMS to identify the method that most accurately classified the actual sitting posture of the seated person. After classifying the sitting postures using several classifiers, average and maximum classification rates of 97.20% and 97.94%, respectively, were obtained from nine subjects with a support vector machine using the radial basis function kernel; the results obtained by this classifier showed a statistically significant difference from the results of multiple classifications using other classifiers.

A large majority of the worldwide population, such as office workers, long journey vehicle drivers and wheelchair users, spends several hours every day in sedentary activities. The postures that sedentary lifestyle users assume during daily activities hide valuable information that can reveal their wellness and general health condition. Aiming at mining such underlying information, we developed a cushion-based system to assess their activity levels and recognize the activity from the information hidden in sitting postures. By placing the smart cushion on the chair, we can monitor users’ postures and body swings, using the sensors deployed in the cushion. Specifically, we construct a body posture analysis model to recognize sitting behaviors. In addition, we provided a smart cushion that effectively combine pressure and inertial sensors. Finally, we propose a method to assess the activity levels based on the evaluation of the activity assessment index (AAI) in time sliding windows. Activity level assessment can be used to provide statistical results in a defined period and deliver recommendation exercise to the users. For practical implications and actual significance of results, we selected wheelchair users among the participants to our experiments. Features in terms of standard deviation and approximate entropy were compared to recognize the activities and activity levels. The results showed that, using the novel designed smart cushion and the standard deviation features, we are able to achieve an accuracy of (>89%) for activity recognition and (>98%) for activity level recognition.",2017,2017-10-01 00:00:00,35.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ccc7b88755165fca0573a614e0a81dd52fbed64

These methods suffer from high computational cost and require stringent labelling and calibration efforts. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight robot navigation framework based purely on uncalibrated spherical images. To simplify the orientation estimation, path prediction and improve computational efficiency, the navigation problem is decomposed into a series of classification tasks. To mitigate the adverse effects of insufficient negative samples in the “navigation via classification” task, we introduce the spherical camera for scene capturing, which enables 360° fisheye panorama as training samples and generation of sufficient positive and negative heading directions. The classification is implemented as an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained on our proposed Spherical-Navi image dataset, whose category labels can be efficiently collected. This CNN is capable of predicting potential path directions with high confidence levels based on a single, uncalibrated spherical image.

Sensitivity analysis is always a crucial element of decision making and in decision trees it often focuses on probabilities. In the stochastic model considered, the user often has only limited information about the true values of probabilities. We develop a framework for performing sensitivity analysis of optimal strategies accounting for this distributional uncertainty. We design this robust optimization approach in an intuitive and not overly technical way, to make it simple to apply in daily managerial practice. The proposed framework allows for (1) analysis of the stability of the expected-value-maximizing strategy and (2) identification of strategies which are robust with respect to pessimistic/optimistic/mode-favoring perturbations of probabilities. We verify the properties of our approach in two cases: (a) probabilities in a tree are the primitives of the model and can be modified independently; (b) probabilities in a tree reflect some underlying, structural probabilities, and are interrelated.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2906934,Robust Intelligent Malware Detection Using Deep Learning,"Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate posing a major security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as deep learning, the feature engineering phase can be completely avoided. Recently reported research studies in this direction show the performance of their algorithms with a biased training data, which limits their practical use in real-time situations. There is a compelling need to mitigate bias and evaluate these methods independently in order to arrive at a new enhanced method for effective zero-day malware detection. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper, first, evaluates the classical MLAs and deep learning architectures for malware detection, classification, and categorization using different public and private datasets. Second, we remove all the dataset bias removed in the experimental analysis by having different splits of the public and private datasets to train and test the model in a disjoint way using different timescales. Third, our major contribution is in proposing a novel image processing technique with optimal parameters for MLAs and deep learning architectures to arrive at an effective zero-day malware detection model. A comprehensive comparative study of our model demonstrates that our proposed deep learning architectures outperform classical MLAs. Our novelty in combining visualization and deep learning architectures for static, dynamic, and image processing-based hybrid approach applied in a big data environment is the first of its kind toward achieving robust intelligent zero-day malware detection.

10.1055/s-0041-1731390,Semantic Textual Similarity in Japanese Clinical Domain Texts Using BERT,"Abstract Background Semantic textual similarity (STS) captures the degree of semantic similarity between texts. It plays an important role in many natural language processing applications such as text summarization, question answering, machine translation, information retrieval, dialog systems, plagiarism detection, and query ranking. STS has been widely studied in the general English domain. However, there exists few resources for STS tasks in the clinical domain and in languages other than English, such as Japanese. Objective The objective of this study is to capture semantic similarity between Japanese clinical texts (Japanese clinical STS) by creating a Japanese dataset that is publicly available. Materials We created two datasets for Japanese clinical STS: (1) Japanese case reports (CR dataset) and (2) Japanese electronic medical records (EMR dataset). The CR dataset was created from publicly available case reports extracted from the CiNii database. The EMR dataset was created from Japanese electronic medical records. Methods We used an approach based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to capture the semantic similarity between the clinical domain texts. BERT is a popular approach for transfer learning and has been proven to be effective in achieving high accuracy for small datasets. We implemented two Japanese pretrained BERT models: a general Japanese BERT and a clinical Japanese BERT. The general Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese Wikipedia texts while the clinical Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese clinical texts. Results The BERT models performed well in capturing semantic similarity in our datasets. The general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT and achieved a high correlation with human score (0.904 in the CR dataset and 0.875 in the EMR dataset). It was unexpected that the general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT on clinical domain dataset.

Although multilingual LMs were also introduced to serve many languages, these have limitations such as being costly at inference time and the size and diversity of non-English data involved in their pre-training. We remedy these issues for a collection of diverse Arabic varieties by introducing two powerful deep bidirectional transformer-based models, ARBERT and MARBERT. To evaluate our models, we also introduce ARLUE, a new benchmark for multi-dialectal Arabic language understanding evaluation. ARLUE is built using 42 datasets targeting six different task clusters, allowing us to offer a series of standardized experiments under rich conditions. When fine-tuned on ARLUE, our models collectively achieve new state-of-the-art results across the majority of tasks (37 out of 48 classification tasks, on the 42 datasets). Our best model acquires the highest ARLUE score (77.40) across all six task clusters, outperforming all other models including XLM-R Large ( 3.4x larger size).

This paper aims to provide a general overview of the textual similarity in the literature. Measuring textual similarity tends to have an increasingly important turn in related topics like text classification, recovery of specific information from data, clustering, topic retrieval, subject tracking, question answering, essay grading, summarization, and the nowadays trending Conversational Agents (CA), which is a program deals with humans through natural language conversation. Finding the similarity between terms is the essential portion of textual similarity, then used as a major phase for sentence-level, paragraph-level, and script-level similarities. In particular, we concern with textual similarity in Arabic. In the Arabic Language, applying Natural language Processing (NLP) tasks are very challenging indeed as it has many characteristics, which are considered as confrontations. However, many approaches for measuring textual similarity have been presented for Arabic text reviewed and compared in this paper.",2020,2020-09-03 00:00:00,6.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/efd07060cd1248f0007569f0bf714cf2f738d42e

10.2196/19735,Measurement of Semantic Textual Similarity in Clinical Texts: Comparison of Transformer-Based Models,"Background Semantic textual similarity (STS) is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Many shared tasks and corpora for STS have been organized and curated in the general English domain; however, such resources are limited in the biomedical domain. In 2019, the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) challenge developed a comprehensive clinical STS dataset and organized a community effort to solicit state-of-the-art solutions for clinical STS. Objective This study presents our transformer-based clinical STS models developed during this challenge as well as new models we explored after the challenge. This project is part of the 2019 n2c2/Open Health NLP shared task on clinical STS. Methods In this study, we explored 3 transformer-based models for clinical STS: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, and Robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa). We examined transformer models pretrained using both general English text and clinical text. We also explored using a general English STS dataset as a supplementary corpus in addition to the clinical training set developed in this challenge. Furthermore, we investigated various ensemble methods to combine different transformer models. Results Our best submission based on the XLNet model achieved the third-best performance (Pearson correlation of 0.8864) in this challenge. After the challenge, we further explored other transformer models and improved the performance to 0.9065 using a RoBERTa model, which outperformed the best-performing system developed in this challenge (Pearson correlation of 0.9010). Conclusions This study demonstrated the efficiency of utilizing transformer-based models to measure semantic similarity for clinical text.

This allows to create multilingual versions from previously monolingual models. The training is based on the idea that a translated sentence should be mapped to the same location in the vector space as the original sentence. We use the original (monolingual) model to generate sentence embeddings for the source language and then train a new system on translated sentences to mimic the original model. Compared to other methods for training multilingual sentence embeddings, this approach has several advantages: It is easy to extend existing models with relatively few samples to new languages, it is easier to ensure desired properties for the vector space, and the hardware requirements for training is lower. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 10 languages from various language families.

We also calculated and obtained the dVMHC value between the cerebral cortexes. Results Compared with the normal control group, the dVMHC of the lingual gyrus (Ling) and the calcarine sulcus (CAL), which represented the visual network (VN), increased significantly in the asthma group, while the dVMHC of the medial superior frontal gyrus (MSFG), the anterior/middle/posterior cingulate gyrus (A/M/PCG), and the supplementary motor area (SMA) of the sensorimotor network decreased significantly in the asthma group. Conclusion This study showed that the ability of emotion regulation and the efficiency of visual and cognitive information processing in patients with BA was lower than in those in the HC group.

Here, we extend LNM by using a multimodal strategy, combining functional and structural networks from 1000 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. We apply multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a combination of motor and sensory tests. Results are two-fold. First, multimodal LNM reveals that the functional modality contributes more than the structural one in the prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, when looking at each modality individually, the performance of the structural networks strongly depended on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, thereby eliminating the effect that larger lesions generally produce more severe sensorimotor impairment. In contrast, functional networks provided similar performance regardless of whether or not the effect of lesion size was removed. Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of network modalities, and their corresponding influence on behavioral performance after brain injury.",2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,4.0,93.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b56c6fbd32d4ec3eeb4fc3988851ebb9c313e7dc
10.1038/s41398-022-02223-2,Structural disconnection-based prediction of poststroke depression,"Poststroke depression (PSD) is a common complication of stroke. Brain network disruptions caused by stroke are potential biological determinants of PSD but their conclusive roles are unavailable. Our study aimed to identify the strategic structural disconnection (SDC) pattern for PSD at three months poststroke and assess the predictive value of SDC information. Our prospective cohort of 697 first-ever acute ischemic stroke patients were recruited from three hospitals in central China. Sociodemographic, clinical, psychological and neuroimaging data were collected at baseline and depression status was assessed at three months poststroke. Voxel-based disconnection-symptom mapping found that SDCs involving bilateral temporal white matter and posterior corpus callosum, as well as white matter next to bilateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, were associated with PSD. This PSD-specific SDC pattern was used to derive SDC scores for all participants. SDC score was an independent predictor of PSD after adjusting for all imaging and clinical-sociodemographic-psychological covariates (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07, 1.48; P  = 0.006). Split-half replication showed the stability and generalizability of above results. When added to the clinical-sociodemographic-psychological prediction model, SDC score significantly improved the model performance and ranked the highest in terms of predictor importance. In conclusion, a strategic SDC pattern involving multiple lobes bilaterally is identified for PSD at 3 months poststroke. The SDC score is an independent predictor of PSD and may improve the predictive performance of the clinical-sociodemographic-psychological prediction model, providing new evidence for the brain-behavior mechanism and biopsychosocial theory of PSD.",2022,2022-11-03 00:00:00,14.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d07e6dfd57844d2bc5cf0a7f2cae34b9794f36f4

10.1093/brain/awac157,Recovered grasping performance after stroke depends on interhemispheric frontoparietal connectivity,"Abstract Activity changes in the ipsi- and contralesional parietal cortex and abnormal interhemispheric connectivity between these regions are commonly observed after stroke, however, their significance for motor recovery remains poorly understood. We here assessed the contribution of ipsilesional and contralesional anterior intraparietal cortex (aIPS) for hand motor function in 18 recovered chronic stroke patients and 18 healthy control subjects using a multimodal assessment consisting of resting-state functional MRI, motor task functional MRI, online-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) interference, and 3D movement kinematics. Effects were compared against two control stimulation sites, i.e. contralesional M1 and a sham stimulation condition. We found that patients with good motor outcome compared to patients with more substantial residual deficits featured increased resting-state connectivity between ipsilesional aIPS and contralesional aIPS as well as between ipsilesional aIPS and dorsal premotor cortex. Moreover, interhemispheric connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional M1 as well as ipsilesional aIPS and contralesional M1 correlated with better motor performance across tasks. TMS interference at individual aIPS and M1 coordinates led to differential effects depending on the motor task that was tested, i.e. index finger-tapping, rapid pointing movements, or a reach-grasp-lift task. Interfering with contralesional aIPS deteriorated the accuracy of grasping, especially in patients featuring higher connectivity between ipsi- and contralesional aIPS. In contrast, interference with the contralesional M1 led to impaired grasping speed in patients featuring higher connectivity between bilateral M1. These findings suggest differential roles of contralesional M1 and aIPS for distinct aspects of recovered hand motor function, depending on the reorganization of interhemispheric connectivity.",2022,2022-04-29 00:00:00,25.0,98.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50c21f00dbd3fe5379a45634df3510b0c18503bc

This is achieved by combining a quadrupole-based transverse phase-space tomography with the adjustable streaking angle of a polarizable X-band transverse deflection structure. We demonstrate with detailed simulations that the method is able to reconstruct various complex phase-space distributions and that the quality of the reconstruction depends on the number of input projections. This method allows for the identification and visualization of previously unnoticed detailed features in the phase-space distribution and can thereby be used as a tool toward improving the performance of particle accelerators or performing more accurate simulation studies.

The use of machine learning allows reconstruction of the 4D phase space distribution of the beam to be carried out much more rapidly than using conventional tomography algorithms, and also enables the use of image compression to reduce signiﬁcantly the size of the data sets involved in the analysis.

10.1038/s41598-021-98785-0,An adaptive approach to machine learning for compact particle accelerators,"Machine learning (ML) tools are able to learn relationships between the inputs and outputs of large complex systems directly from data. However, for time-varying systems, the predictive capabilities of ML tools degrade if the systems are no longer accurately represented by the data with which the ML models were trained. For complex systems, re-training is only possible if the changes are slow relative to the rate at which large numbers of new input-output training data can be non-invasively recorded. In this work, we present an approach to deep learning for time-varying systems that does not require re-training, but uses instead an adaptive feedback in the architecture of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The feedback is based only on available system output measurements and is applied in the encoded low-dimensional dense layers of the encoder-decoder CNNs. First, we develop an inverse model of a complex accelerator system to map output beam measurements to input beam distributions, while both the accelerator components and the unknown input beam distribution vary rapidly with time. We then demonstrate our method on experimental measurements of the input and output beam distributions of the HiRES ultra-fast electron diffraction (UED) beam line at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and showcase its ability for automatic tracking of the time varying photocathode quantum efficiency map.

For example, CNNs can be used to map combinations of accelerator parameters and images which are 2D projections of the 6D phase space distributions of charged particle beams as they are transported between various particle accelerator locations. Despite their strengths, applying ML to time-varying systems, or systems with shifting distributions, is an open problem, especially for large systems for which collecting new data for re-training is impractical or interrupts operations. Particle accelerators are one example of large time-varying systems for which collecting detailed training data requires lengthy dedicated beam measurements which may no longer be available during regular operations. We present a novel method of adaptive ML for time-varying systems. Our approach is to map very high (N ≈ 100k) dimensional inputs (a combination of scalar parameters and images) into the low dimensional (N ≈ 2) latent space at the output of the encoder section of an encoder-decoder CNN. We then actively tune the low dimensional latent space-based representation of complex system dynamics by the addition of an adaptively tuned feedback vector directly before the decoder sections builds back up to our image-based high-dimensional phase space density representations. This method allows us to learn correlations within and to quickly tune the characteristics of incredibly large parameter space systems and to track their evolution in real time based on feedback without massive new data sets for re-training. We demonstrate that our method can accurately predict and track the phase space of charged particle beams at various locations in a particle accelerator by adaptively adjusting in real-time while the unknown input beam distribution of the accelerator is changing in shape, charge, and offset and while the RF system of the accelerator itself is also changing in an unpredictable way.

The manual process of burn diagnosis is time-consuming and complex, even for experienced doctors. Machine learning (ML) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models have emerged as the standard for medical image diagnosis. The ML-based approach typically requires handcrafted features for training, which may result in suboptimal performance. Conversely, DL-based methods automatically extract features, but designing a robust model is challenging. Additionally, shallow DL methods lack long-range feature dependency, decreasing efficiency in various applications. We implemented several deep CNN models, ResNeXt, VGG16, and AlexNet, for human burn diagnosis. The results obtained from these models were found to be less reliable since shallow deep CNN models need improved attention modules to preserve the feature dependencies. Therefore, in the proposed study, the feature map is divided into several categories, and the channel dependencies between any two channel mappings within a given class are highlighted. A spatial attention map is built by considering the links between features and their locations. Our attention-based model BuRnGANeXt50 kernel and convolutional layers are also optimized for human burn diagnosis. The earlier study classified the burn based on depth of graft and non-graft. We first classified the burn based on the degree. Subsequently, it is classified into graft and non-graft. Furthermore, the proposed model performance is evaluated on Burns_BIP_US_database. The sensitivity of the BuRnGANeXt50 is 97.22% and 99.14%, respectively, for classifying burns based on degree and depth.

10.1093/jbcr/irad051,Clinical Investigation of a Rapid Non-invasive Multispectral Imaging Device Utilizing an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm for Improved Burn Assessment,"Abstract Currently, the incorrect judgment of burn depth remains common even among experienced surgeons. Contributing to this problem are change in burn appearance throughout the first week requiring periodic evaluation until a confident diagnosis can be made. To overcome these issues, we investigated the feasibility of an artificial intelligence algorithm trained with multispectral images of burn injuries to predict burn depth rapidly and accurately, including burns of indeterminate depth. In a feasibility study, 406 multispectral images of burns were collected within 72 hours of injury and then serially for up to 7 days. Simultaneously, the subject’s clinician indicated whether the burn was of indeterminate depth. The final depth of burned regions within images were agreed upon by a panel of burn practitioners using biopsies and 21-day healing assessments as reference standards. We compared three convolutional neural network architectures and an ensemble in their capability to automatically highlight areas of nonhealing burn regions within images. The top algorithm was the ensemble with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 97% positive predictive value (PPV). Its sensitivity and PPV were found to increase in a sigmoid shape during the first week postburn, with the inflection point at day 2.5. Additionally, when burns were labeled as indeterminate, the algorithm’s sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value were: 70%, 100%, 97%, and 100%. These results suggest multispectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence is feasible for detecting nonhealing burn tissue and could play an important role in aiding the earlier diagnosis of indeterminate burns.",2023,2023-04-21 00:00:00,5.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c6b6bd82173e835b696a160972e9923ecb3ab47

An additional aim assessed the performances in different Fitzpatrick skin types. Annotated burn (n = 1105) and background (n = 536) images were collected. Using a commercially available platform for deep learning algorithms, two models were trained and validated on 70% of the images and tested on the remaining 30%. Accuracy was measured for each image using the percentage of wound area correctly identified and F1 scores for the wound identifier; and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity for the wound classifier. The wound identifier algorithm detected an average of 87.2% of the wound areas accurately in the test set. For the wound classifier algorithm, the AUC was 0.885. The wound identifier algorithm was more accurate in patients with darker skin types; the wound classifier was more accurate in patients with lighter skin types. To conclude, image-based algorithms can support the assessment of acute burns with relatively good accuracy although larger and different datasets are needed.",2023,2023-01-31 00:00:00,8.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/731b03e63aa709f66655c048e75fd0f57213241e
10.1364/boe.479567,Triage of in vivo burn injuries and prediction of wound healing outcome using neural networks and modeling of the terahertz permittivity based on the double Debye dielectric parameters.,"The initial assessment of the depth of a burn injury during triage forms the basis for determination of the course of the clinical treatment plan. However, severe skin burns are highly dynamic and hard to predict. This results in a low accuracy rate of about 60 - 75% in the diagnosis of partial-thickness burns in the acute post-burn period. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has demonstrated a significant potential for non-invasive and timely estimation of the burn severity. Here, we describe a methodology for the measurement and numerical modeling of the dielectric permittivity of the in vivo porcine skin burns. We use the double Debye dielectric relaxation theory to model the permittivity of the burned tissue. We further investigate the origins of dielectric contrast between the burns of various severity, as determined histologically based on the percentage of the burned dermis, using the empirical Debye parameters. We demonstrate that the five parameters of the double Debye model can form an artificial neural network classification algorithm capable of automatic diagnosis of the severity of the burn injuries, and predicting its ultimate wound healing outcome by forecasting its re-epithelialization status in 28 days. Our results demonstrate that the Debye dielectric parameters provide a physics-based approach for the extraction of the biomedical diagnostic markers from the broadband THz pulses. This method can significantly boost dimensionality reduction of THz training data in artificial intelligence models and streamline machine learning algorithms.",2022,2022-12-22 00:00:00,7.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6157a37f3a1103fcedea55a559ecfae17d2709a

10.3390/bios12121182,Feature-Based Information Retrieval of Multimodal Biosignals with a Self-Similarity Matrix: Focus on Automatic Segmentation,"Biosignal-based technology has been increasingly available in our daily life, being a critical information source. Wearable biosensors have been widely applied in, among others, biometrics, sports, health care, rehabilitation assistance, and edutainment. Continuous data collection from biodevices provides a valuable volume of information, which needs to be curated and prepared before serving machine learning applications. One of the universal preparation steps is data segmentation and labelling/annotation. This work proposes a practical and manageable way to automatically segment and label single-channel or multimodal biosignal data using a self-similarity matrix (SSM) computed with signals’ feature-based representation. Applied to public biosignal datasets and a benchmark for change point detection, the proposed approach delivered lucid visual support in interpreting the biosignals with the SSM while performing accurate automatic segmentation of biosignals with the help of the novelty function and associating the segments grounded on their similarity measures with the similarity profiles. The proposed method performed superior to other algorithms in most cases of a series of automatic biosignal segmentation tasks; of equal appeal is that it provides an intuitive visualization for information retrieval of multimodal biosignals.",2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,33.0,97.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c824d095fbf7d9afdde8c36909fc70eb569f15c3
10.7150/ijms.77818,Contribution of Body Mass Index Stratification for the Prediction of Maximal Oxygen Uptake,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether modeling within separate body mass index (BMI) stratifications improves the accuracy of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) prediction compared to a model developed regardless of adults' BMIs. A total of 250 Taiwanese adults (total group, TOG) aged 22-64 years participated in this study, and were stratified into a normal group (NOG: 135), an overweight group (OVG: 69), and an obesity group (OBG: 46), according to the BMI classification recommended by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare. VO2max was directly measured on an electromagnetic bicycle ergometer. Using the participant's heart rate in the 3-min incremental step-in-place test and demographic parameters, VO2max prediction models established for four groups were TOG model, NOG model, OVG model, and OBG model, respectively. Compared with the TOG model, the OVG and OBG models had higher coefficients of determination and lower standard error of estimates (SEEs), or %SEEs. The validities of the NOG (r = 0.780), OVG (r = 0.776), and OBG (r = 0.791) models for BMI subgroups increased by 1.79%, 4.64%, and 8.22% respectively, and the reliabilities (NOG model: ICC = 0.755; OVG model: ICC = 0.765; OBG model: ICC = 0.779) increased by 3.18%, 3.27%, and 9.63%, respectively. These results suggested using separate models established in BMI stratifications can effectively improve the prediction of VO2max.",2022,2022-10-31 00:00:00,4.0,52.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/053ce79596ea7bdcf63776c642e94f444cb3f97e

The experimental results prove that the reliability and validity of the second-level quantitative load scheme for power vehicles are better and can be used as the maximum oxygen uptake in the laboratory, directly tested with alternative submaximal solutions, and used for large-scale investigation of maximum oxygen uptake data. At the same time, since the load is submaximal, it can also be used to clinically assess the patient’s cardiorespiratory endurance.",2022,2022-05-19 00:00:00,2.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e77c900c34072dc0dfbf4f0b10c45bd111208b02

The typical mobile-based HRV device simply records interbeat intervals, without differentiation between noise or arrythmia as can be done with an electrocardiogram (ECG). The intent of this report is to validate a new single channel ECG device, the Movesense Medical sensor, against a conventional 12 channel ECG. A heterogeneous group of 21 participants performed an incremental cycling ramp to failure with measurements of HRV, before (PRE), during (EX), and after (POST). Results showed excellent correlations between devices for linear indexes with Pearson’s r between 0.98 to 1.0 for meanRR, SDNN, RMSSD, and 0.95 to 0.97 for the non-linear index DFA a1 during PRE, EX, and POST. There was no significant difference in device specific meanRR during PRE and POST. Bland–Altman analysis showed high agreement between devices (PRE and POST: meanRR bias of 0.0 and 0.4 ms, LOA of 1.9 to −1.8 ms and 2.3 to −1.5; EX: meanRR bias of 11.2 to 6.0 ms; LOA of 29.8 to −7.4 ms during low intensity exercise and 8.5 to 3.5 ms during high intensity exercise).

However, the methodology underlying machine learning in spine research is often overlooked as the subject matter is quite novel and may be foreign to practicing spine surgeons. Improper application of machine learning is a significant bioethics challenge, given the potential consequences of over- or underestimating the results of such studies for clinical decision-making processes. Proper peer review of these publications requires a baseline familiarity of the language associated with machine learning, and how it differs from classical statistical analyses. This narrative review first introduces the overall field of machine learning and its role in artificial intelligence, and defines basic terminology. In addition, common modalities for applying machine learning, including classification and regression decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are examined in the context of examples gathered from the spine literature.

10.14245/ns.1938414.207,Artificial Intelligence for Adult Spinal Deformity,"Adult spinal deformity (ASD) is a complex disease that significantly affects the lives of many patients. Surgical correction has proven to be effective in achieving improvement of spinopelvic parameters as well as improving quality of life (QoL) for these patients. However, given the relatively high complication risk associated with ASD correction, it is of paramount importance to develop robust prognostic tools for predicting risk profile and outcomes. Historically, statistical models such as linear and logistic regression models were used to identify preoperative factors associated with postoperative outcomes. While these tools were useful for looking at simple associations, they represent generalizations across large populations, with little applicability to individual patients. More recently, predictive analytics utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning for comprehensive processing of large amounts of data have become available for surgeons to implement. The use of these computational techniques has given surgeons the ability to leverage far more accurate and individualized predictive tools to better inform individual patients regarding predicted outcomes after ASD correction surgery. Applications range from predicting QoL measures to predicting the risk of major complications, hospital readmission, and reoperation rates. In addition, AI has been used to create a novel classification system for ASD patients, which will help surgeons identify distinct patient subpopulations with unique risk-benefit profiles. Overall, these tools will help surgeons tailor their clinical practice to address patients’ individual needs and create an opportunity for personalized medicine within spine surgery.",2019,2019-12-01 00:00:00,44.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab3096e7cfdb16b652c332da24dbec6258ef6422

A central question of GPCR drug discovery is to understand what determines the agonism or antagonism of ligands which bind them. Ligands exert their action via the interactions in the ligand binding pocket. We hypothesised that there is a common set of receptor interactions made by ligands of diverse structures that mediate their action and that among a large dataset of different ligands, the functionally important interactions will be over-represented. We computationally docked ~2700 known β2AR ligands to multiple β2AR structures, generating ca 75,000 docking poses and predicted all atomic interactions between the receptor and the ligand. We used machine learning (ML) techniques to identify specific interactions that correlate with the agonist or antagonist activity of these ligands. The interpretation of ML analysis in human understandable form allowed us to construct an exquisitely detailed structure-activity relationship that identifies small changes to the ligands that invert their activity and thus helps to guide the drug discovery process.

10.1186/s12863-022-01054-w,Identification of key sex-specific pathways and genes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue from pigs using WGCNA method,"Background Adipose tissues (ATs), including visceral ATs (VATs) and subcutaneous ATs (SATs), are crucial for maintaining energy and metabolic homeostasis. SATs have been found to be closely related to obesity and obesity-induced metabolic disease. Some studies have shown a significant association between subcutaneous fat metabolism and sexes. However, the molecular mechanisms for this association are still unclear. Here, using the pig as a model, we investigated the systematic association between the subcutaneous fat metabolism and sexes, and identified some key sex-specific pathways and genes in the SATs from pigs. Results The results revealed that 134 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in female and male pigs from the obese group. A total of 17 coexpression modules were detected, of which six modules were significantly correlated with the sexes ( P  < 0.01). Among the significant modules, the greenyellow module (cor = 0.68, P  < 9e-06) and green module (cor = 0.49, P  < 0.003) were most significantly positively correlated with the male and female, respectively. Functional analysis showed that one GO term and four KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the greenyellow module while six GO terms and six KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the green module. Furthermore, a total of five and two key sex-specific genes were identified in the two modules, respectively. Two key sex-specific pathways (Ras-MAPK signaling pathway and type I interferon response) play an important role in the SATs of males and females, respectively. Conclusions The present study identified some key sex-specific pathways and genes in the SATs from pigs, which provided some new insights into the molecular mechanism of being involved in fat formation and immunoregulation between pigs of different sexes. These findings may be beneficial to breeding in the pig industry and obesity treatment in medicine.",2022,2022-05-10 00:00:00,7.0,79.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fd43f58974c5bba2b4de94280d0694ef53b92364
10.3390/ani12010119,ACSL4 Directs Intramuscular Adipogenesis and Fatty Acid Composition in Pigs,"Simple Summary In the livestock industry, intramuscular fat content is an important indicator of the meat quality of domestic animals. The variations of the Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene locus are associated with intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the detailed molecular function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis remains obscure. Our study reveals the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and provides new clues for improving the palatability of meat and enhancing the nutritional value of pork for human health. Abstract The intramuscular fat is a major quality trait of meat, affecting sensory attributes such as flavor and texture. Several previous GWAS studies identified Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene as the candidate gene to regulate intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the underlying molecular function of ACSL4 in adipogenesis within pig skeletal muscle is not fully investigated. In this study, we isolated porcine endogenous intramuscular adipocyte progenitors and performed ACSL4 loss- and gain-of-function experiments during adipogenic differentiation. Our data showed that ACSL4 is a positive regulator of adipogenesis in intramuscular fat cells isolated from pigs. More interestingly, the enhanced expression of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipocytes could increase the cellular content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as gamma-L eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The above results not only confirmed the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and meat quality attributes, but also provided new clues for the improvement of the nutritional value of pork for human health.",2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,12.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74d7ebb8d6924daa6e88f5869d675bdbce09f9e5

10.3389/fgene.2021.649140,Effect of the ACAA1 Gene on Preadipocyte Differentiation in Sheep,"Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1) functions as a key regulator of fatty acid β-oxidation in peroxisomes by catalyzing the cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acyl-CoA, which participate in the extension and degradation of fatty acids. Thus, ACAA1 is an important regulator of lipid metabolism and plays an essential role in fatty acid oxidation and lipid metabolism. Our previous study findings revealed that ACAA1 is closely associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and fatty acid metabolism pathways, which are involved in fat deposition in sheep, leading to our hypothesis that ACAA1 may be involved in fat deposition by regulating lipid metabolism. However, the associated molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, to assess the potential function of ACAA1 in sheep preadipocyte differentiation, we knocked down and overexpressed ACAA1 in sheep preadipocytes and evaluated the pattern of ACAA1 gene expression during preadipocyte differentiation by qRT-PCR. ACAA1 was significantly expressed in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, and then its expression decreased. ACAA1 deficiency increased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content and promoted sheep preadipocyte differentiation, whereas ACAA1 overexpression inhibited adipogenesis and decreased lipid accumulation and the triglyceride content. Simultaneously, we demonstrated that ACAA1 deficiency upregulated the expressions of the adipogenic marker genes PPARγ and C/EBPα in sheep preadipocytes, but ACAA1 overexpression inhibited the expressions of these markers, indicating that ACAA1 affects lipid metabolism by regulating adipogenic marker genes. Our results may promote a better understanding of the regulation of adipogenesis by ACAA1.",2021,2021-06-21 00:00:00,27.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0773e8d8294b1eb48cb25c5a2a87863b153ea753

10.1042/BSR20210328,Down-regulation of RBP4 indicates a poor prognosis and correlates with immune cell infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Abstract Recent research has indicated that metabolically related genes play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We evaluated the associations between novel biomarkers and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) for predicting clinical HCC outcomes, hub-related genes, pathway regulation, and immune cells infiltration. Bioinformatic analyses based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were performed using online analysis tools. RBP4 expression was low in HCC and was also down-regulated in pan-cancers compared with normal tissues. RBP4 expression was also significantly different based on age (41–60 years old versus 61–80 years old), and low RBP4 expression levels were associated with advanced tumor stages and grades. Higher RBP4 expression was associated with better overall survival time in HCC patients, and we identified a deletion-mutation rate of 1.4% in RBP4. We also identified ten co-expressed genes most related to RBP4 and explored the relationships between six hub genes (APOB, FGA, FGG, SERPINC1, APOA1, and F2) involved in RBP4 regulation. A pathway enrichment analysis for RBP4 indicated complement and coagulation cascades, metabolic pathways, antibiotic biosynthesis pathways, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways, and pyruvate metabolism pathways. These results suggest that RBP4 may be a novel biomarker for HCC prognosis, and an indicator of low immune response to the disease.",2021,2021-04-01 00:00:00,18.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed80ac70e664ea683edbca0a30300b8666592a2b

We enhance our method by incorporating deep learning techniques and multi-modal imaging data, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) images alongside fundus photographs, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of retinal pathology. The advanced EDL integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms with Capsule Networks (CapsNet) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for more nuanced feature extraction and classification. We introduce a novel ensemble adaptive weighting approach that dynamically adjusts classifier weights based on performance across disease types and severity levels, significantly improving the algorithm's handling of complex and rare cases. To enhance model interpretability, we implement an explainable AI component that provides visual heatmaps of the most significant regions for each diagnosis to clinicians. We evaluate the enhanced EDL on a large, diverse dataset encompassing multiple retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma, across various ethnicities and age groups. Our results demonstrate superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to our previous model and other state-of-the-art approaches. A prospective clinical validation study assesses the algorithm's real-world performance.

Previous work in cyber bullying detection is often confronted with limitations in accurately detecting abusive behavior because of the intricacies in cyber space and evolution of cyber bullying practices. A new approach of Cyber bullying detection and classification network (CBDC- Net) for improving the effectiveness of detection of cyber bullying in OSNs based on natural language processing features, feature selection techniques, and deep learning algorithms is also presented in this study. CBDC-Net can overcome these challenges to existing detection methods of cyber bullying using innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning approaches. In the data preprocessing step, CBDC-Net filter and normalize the text data that is openly collected from OSNs. After that, CBDC-Net extracts features using a Synonym Level N-Gram (SLNG) approach and it incorporates both the word and character-based information to make the synonyms of text much better than the other method. After that, CSI of CBDC-Net applied Textual Similarity Resilient Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (TSR-SCSO) for feature selection to give an iterative value of their features’ importance level to detect cyber bullying. Last, in CBDC-Net, a Recurrent Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)Neural Network for classification (RBLNN) is used as classification approach is applied, which recognizes the sequential nature of textual data enabling proper distinction between cyber bullying cases.

Video Analytics for human action recognition is given significance due to its utility. However, it is very challenging to analyze live-streaming videos to identify human actions across the frames in the video. The literature showed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among computer vision applications' most popular deep learning algorithms. Another important observation is that Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) architecture with deep learning has the potential to leverage effectiveness in applications using computer vision. Inspired by this finding, we created a GAN-based framework (called HARGAN) in this research for human activity identification from surveillance films. The framework exploits a retrained deep learning model known as ResNet50 and convolutional LSTM for better performance in action recognition. Our framework has two critical functionalities: feature learning and human action recognition. The ResNet50 model achieves the former, while the GAN-based convolutional LSTM model achieves the latter. We proposed an algorithm called the Generative Adversarial Approach for Human Action Recognition (GAA-HAR) to realize the framework. We used a benchmark dataset known as UCF50, which is extensively used in studies on human action identification. Based on our experimental findings, the suggested framework performs better than the current baseline models like CNN, LSTM, and convolutional LSTM, with the highest accuracy of 97.73%.

The inherent diversity within IoT networks renders them suitable for a myriad of real-time applications, firmly embedding them into the fabric of daily life. While IoT devices streamline various activities, their susceptibility to security threats is a glaring concern. Current inadequacies in security measures render IoT networks vulnerable, presenting an enticing target for attackers. This study suggests a novel dealing to address this challenge through the execution of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) leveraging superior deep learning models. Inspired by the benefits of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), we introduce the Genetic Bee LSTM(GBLSTM) networks for the development of intelligent IDS capable of detecting a wide range of cyber-attacks targeting IoT area. The methodology comprises four key execution: (i) collection of unit for profiling normal IoT device behavior, (ii) Identification of malicious devices during an attack, (iii) Prediction of attack types implemented in the network. Intensive experimentations of the suggested IDS are conducted using various validation methods and prominent metrics across different IoT threat scenarios. Moreover, comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the suggested models alongside existing learning models.

10.22399/ijcesen.676,Exploring Deep Computational Intelligence Approaches for Enhanced Predictive Modeling in Big Data Environments,"The rapid growth of big data has created a pressing need for advanced predictive modeling techniques that can efficiently extract meaningful insights from massive, complex datasets. This study explores deep computational intelligence approaches to enhance predictive modeling in big data environments, focusing on the integration of deep learning, swarm intelligence, and hybrid optimization techniques. The proposed framework employs a Deep Neural Network (DNN) enhanced with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Adaptive Gradient Descent (AGD) for dynamic parameter tuning, leading to improved learning efficiency and accuracy.

Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in model performance, with an accuracy of 97.8% in healthcare diagnostics, a precision of 95.2% in financial risk prediction, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.4% in energy forecasting. Additionally, the proposed approach achieves a 35% reduction in computational overhead compared to traditional DNNs and a 28% improvement in convergence speed due to the hybrid optimization. 
This work highlights the potential of integrating deep computational intelligence with big data analytics to achieve robust, scalable, and efficient predictive modeling.

10.22399/ijcesen.560,Revolutionizing Facial Recognition: A Dolphin Glowworm Hybrid Approach for Masked and Unmasked Scenarios,"Machine learning has several essential applications, including classification and recognition. Both people and objects may be identified using the Machine learning technique. It is particularly important in the verification process since it recognizes the characteristics of human eyes, fingerprints, and facial patterns. With the advanced technology developments, nowadays, Facial recognition is used as one of the authentication processes by utilizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms and it has been the subject of several academic studies.  These algorithms performed well on faces without masks, but not well on faces with masks. since the masks obscured the preponderance of the facial features. As a result, an improved algorithm for facial identification with and without masks is required. After the Covid-19 breakout, deep learning algorithms were utilized in research to recognize faces wearing masks. Those algorithms, however, were trained on both mask- and mask-free faces. Hence, in this, the cropped region for the faces is only used for facial recognition. Here, the features were extracted using the texture features, and the best-optimized features from the glow worm optimization algorithm are used in this paper. With these features set, the hybrid Dolphin glow worm optimization is used for finding the optimal features and spread function value for the neural network. The regression neural network is trained with the optimized feature set and spread function for the face recognition task. The performance of the suggested method will be compared to that of known approaches such as CNN-GSO and CNN for face recognition with and without masks using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity will next be examined.",2024,2024-11-16 00:00:00,13.0,18.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8be5972ab997df92326e0b58486a9ddf86e52cc2

10.1155/2023/1110500,Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease Using DHO-Based Pretrained CNN Model,"Detecting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) early on allows patients to take preventative measures before the onset of irreversible brain damage, which is a critical factor in the treatment of Alzheimer’s patients. Most machine detection methods are constrained by congenital observations, although computers have been utilized in several recent research studies to diagnose AD. In AD, the hippocampus is usually the first part of the brain to be affected. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (SMRI) can be used to assist in diagnosing AD by measuring the hippocampus’s form and volume (MRI). The information encoded by these attributes is restricted and may be affected by segmentation problems. These traits are also extracted independently of the classification, which could result in lower-than-desired classification accuracy. Researchers in this study used structural MRI data to develop a deep learning framework for combined automatic hippocampus segmentation and AD categorization. Multi-task deep learning (MTDL) is used to learn hippocampus segmentation simultaneously. The hyperparameter optimization of the CNN model (capsule network) for illness classification is then carried out using the deer hunting optimization (DHO) technique. ADNI-standardized MRI datasets have been used to test the suggested method, and it is accurate.

10.1002/dac.5524,Energy‐efficient resource allocation model for device‐to‐device communication in 5G wireless personal area networks,"In general, there are several many devices that can overload the network and reduce performance. Devices can minimize interference and optimize bandwidth usage by using directional antennas and by avoiding overlapping communication ranges. In addition, devices need to carefully manage their use of resources, such as bandwidth and energy. Bandwidth is limited in wireless personal area networks (WPANs), so devices need to carefully select which data to send and receive. In this paper, an intelligent performance analysis of energy‐efficient resource optimization model has been proposed for device‐to‐device (D2D) communication in fifth‐generation (5G) WPAN. The proposed energy‐efficient resource allocation in D2D communication is important because it helps reduce energy consumption and extend the lifespan of devices that are communicating with each other. By allocating resources in an efficient manner, communication between two devices can be optimized for maximum efficiency. This helps reduce the amount of energy needed to power the communication, as well as the amount of energy needed to power the device that is communicating with another device. Additionally, efficient resource allocation helps reduce the overall cost of communication, as the use of fewer resources results in a lower overall cost. The proposed efficient resource allocation helps reduce the environmental impact of communication, as less energy is used for communication.

Therefore, countless artificial intelligence applications can be seen in the medical domain at various levels, which are employed to enhance early diagnosis and prediction and reduce the risks associated with many diseases, including heart diseases. In this article, machine learning techniques (logistic regression, random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors) are utilized to diagnose heart disease from the Cleveland Clinic dataset got from the University of California Irvine machine learning (UCL) repository and Kaggle platform then create a comparison between the performance of these techniques. In addition, some literature related to machine learning and deep learning techniques that aim to provide reasonable solutions in monitoring, detecting, diagnosing, and predicting heart disease and how these technologies assist in making health decisions are reviewed. Ten studies are selected and summarized by the authors published between 2017 and 2022 are illustrated. After executing a series of tests, it is seen that the most profitable performance in diagnosing heart disease is the support vector machines, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96%.

The need to explore possible ways to tackle the disease necessitated this study. The study designed a machine learning model for cardiovascular disease risk prediction in accordance with a dataset that contains 11 features which may be used to forecast the disease. The dataset from Kaggle on cardiovascular disease includes approximately 70,000 patient records that were used to determine the outcome. Compared to the UCI dataset, the Kaggle dataset has many more training and validation records. Models created using neural networks, random forests, Bayesian networks, C5.0, and QUEST were compared for this dataset. On training and testing data sets, the results acquired a high accuracy (99.1 percent), which is significantly superior to previous methods. Ahead-of-time detection and diagnosis of cardiac disease, as well as better treatment outcomes, are strong possibilities for the suggested prediction model.

People have been experimenting with techniques to extend their lives since ancient times. Despite this, technology is still a long way from attaining the aim of lowering mortality rates. Methods From methodological perspective, a design Science Research (DSR) approach is adopted in this research. As such, to investigate the current healthcare and interaction systems created for predicting cardiac disease for patients, we first analyzed the body of existing literature. After that, a conceptual framework of the system was designed using the gathered requirements. Based on the conceptual framework, the development of different components of the system was completed. Finally, the evaluation study procedure was developed taking into account the effectiveness, usability and efficiency of the developed system. Results To attain the objectives, we proposed a system consisting of a wearable device and mobile application, which allows the users to know their risk levels of having CVDs in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques were adopted to develop the system that can classify its users into three risk levels (high, moderate and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 80.4% and two risk levels (high and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 91%. The stacking classifier incorporating best-performing ML algorithms was used for predicting the risk levels of the end-users utilizing the UCI Repository dataset. Conclusion The resultant system allows the users to check and monitor their possibility of having CVD in near future using real-time data. Also, the system was evaluated from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) point of view. Thus, the created system offers a promising resolution to the current biomedical sector.

10.3390/min12010049,Objective Domain Boundaries Detection in New Caledonian Nickel Laterite from Spectra Using Quadrant Scan,"Modelling of 3D domain boundaries using information from drill holes is a standard procedure in mineral exploration and mining. Manual logging of drill holes can be difficult to exploit as the results may not be comparable between holes due to the subjective nature of geological logging. Exploration and mining companies commonly collect geochemical or mineralogical data from diamond drill core or drill chips; however, manual interpretation of multivariate data can be slow and challenging; therefore, automation of any of the steps in the interpretation process would be valuable. Hyperspectral analysis of drill chips provides a relatively inexpensive method of collecting very detailed information rapidly and consistently. However, the challenge of such data is the high dimensionality of the data’s variables in comparison to the number of samples. Hyperspectral data is usually processed to produce mineral abundances generally involving a range of assumptions. This paper presents the results of testing a new fast and objective methodology to identify the lithological boundaries from high dimensional hyperspectral data. This method applies a quadrant scan analysis to recurrence plots. The results, applied to nickel laterite deposits from New Caledonia, demonstrate that this method can identify transitions in the downhole data. These are interpreted as reflecting mineralogical changes that can be used as an aid in geological logging to improve boundary detection.",2021,2021-12-29 00:00:00,4.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3dec49892bb2c0b276db58768c0532e2dbc78301

However, large multi-element data sets are slow and challenging to interpret without using some form of automated analysis, such as mathematical, statistical or machine learning techniques. Automated analysis techniques also have the advantage in that they are repeatable and can provide consistent results, even for very large data sets. In this paper, an automated litho-geochemical interpretation workflow is demonstrated, which includes data exploration and data preparation using appropriate compositional data-analysis techniques. Multiscale analysis using a modified wavelet tessellation has been applied to the data to provide coherent geological domains. Unsupervised machine learning (clustering) has been used to provide a first-pass classification. The results are compared with the detailed geologist’s logs. The comparison shows how the integration of automated analysis of geochemical data can be used to enhance traditional geological logging and demonstrates the identification of new geological units from the automated litho-geochemical logging that were not apparent from visual logging but are geochemically distinct. KEY POINTS To reduce computational complexity and facilitate interpretation, a subset of geochemical elements is selected, and then a centred log-ratio transform is applied. The wavelet tessellation method is used to domain the drill holes into rock units at a range of scales. Several clustering methods were tested to identify distinct rock units in the samples and multiscale domains for classification. Results are compared with geologist’s logs to assess how geochemical data analysis can inform and improve traditional geology logs.",2021,2021-09-27 00:00:00,10.0,85.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77e8be0bb4725babb4c79ef27089595fcb923a2b

High spatial resolution (0.2–1.0 mm/pixel) hyperspectral imagery in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) were acquired on 755 rock samples and 400 m of continuous drill core. Spectral metrics are used to measure the relative abundance of 12 minerals and an additional metric is derived to estimate white mica grain size. In the Valley and Lornex deposits, coarse-grained white mica is associated with mineralization and is detectable up to 4 km away from the deposits. Kaolinite is present within 2 km of the mineralized centers but does not necessarily occur within strongly mineralized intervals. Prehnite is ubiquitous from 4 to 8 km from the deposits. In the Bethlehem deposit, tourmaline and epidote are associated with mineralization. We propose a spectral alteration score based on these proximal hyperspectral SWIR mineralogical patterns to assist explorers in targeting porphyry Cu systems when using drill core, surface rock samples and potentially remote sensing imagery. In a production environment, this metric could serve to facilitate ore-sorting.",2020,2020-05-23 00:00:00,19.0,60.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2038fe4ff083a8a6055da5e0c8ade32fef692b51
10.1007/s11004-020-09859-0,Improving Automated Geological Logging of Drill Holes by Incorporating Multiscale Spatial Methods,"Manually interpreting multivariate drill hole data is very time-consuming, and different geologists will produce different results due to the subjective nature of geological interpretation. Automated or semi-automated interpretation of numerical drill hole data is required to reduce time and subjectivity of this process. However, results from machine learning algorithms applied to drill holes, without reference to spatial information, typically result in numerous small-scale units. These small-scale units result not only from the presence of very small rock units, which may be below the scale of interest, but also from misclassification. A novel method is proposed that uses the continuous wavelet transform to identify geological boundaries and uses wavelet coefficients to indicate boundary strength. The wavelet coefficient is a useful measure of boundary strength because it reflects both wavelength and amplitude of features in the signal. This means that boundary strength is an indicator of the apparent thickness of geological units and the amount of change occurring at each geological boundary. For multivariate data, boundaries from multiple variables are combined and multiscale domains are calculated using the combined boundary strengths. The method is demonstrated using multi-element geochemical data from mineral exploration drill holes. The method is fast, reduces misclassification, provides a choice of scales of interpretation and results in hierarchical classification for large scales where domains may contain more than one rock type.",2020,2020-03-11 00:00:00,34.0,42.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/322a25c5ea471e468048ff94e43eaeac4a38e3a0

This interpretation method uses readily available distributed 3D data at the most relevant scale for mining and exploration. This method does not depend on collecting traditional structural data from core, such as orientation of planar and linear data, but relies on the premise that grade distributions sampled from drilling provide insight into the structural control of the deposit, with the interpretation of structural geometry done using a computer 3D viewer. This method is applied to the well-studied Archean Sigma-Lamaque gold deposit, which features late-orogenic vein mineralization, and which is controlled by three orders of structural features. The first-order control is the easterly plunging pipe-like conduit parallel to F 2 fold plunge defined by the intersection of bedding (S 0 ) and foliation (S 2 ) (~ 1.5 km radius × 3 km down-plunge). The second-order controls, nested within the first-order, are the younger subvertical Late Diorite plugs that intruded vertically into the host rocks along the established S 2 foliation anisotropy (1250:400:150 m dimension for Main Plug). The third-order control, laterally limited by first- and second-order structural controls, is the well-documented gold-bearing vein sets (1–10 m thick and up to 1.5 km in extent) that developed in the Late Diorites and in the older folded volcanogenic stratigraphy and diorites. It is proposed that the first-order control defined by the moderately plunging F 2 fold is the main fluid pathway resulting from structural permeability formed during earlier folding. The second-order Late Diorite plugs and other competent lithological units, which intersected and fractured during late-stage D 2 compression, served as chemically reactive sites causing gold to precipitate along this first-order pathway. It is predicted that intrusions that do not intersect the first-order structural conduits are less likely to be mineralized. Greenfield orogenic-gold exploration requires that the first-order controls are identified, and the geometry of hydrothermal alteration is best understood in the context of the structural architecture of the host rocks.",2020,2020-01-27 00:00:00,24.0,87.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f02987c38f60190275d9800a6e71c99362263730

In this paper, a methodology to integrate mineralogical and structural data extracted from hyperspectral drill-core scans is proposed. The workflow allows for the identification of vein types based on minerals having significant absorption features in the short-wave infrared. The method not only targets alteration halos of known compositions but also allows for the identification of any vein-like structure. The results consist of vein distribution maps, quantified vein abundances, and their azimuths. Three drill-cores from the Bolcana porphyry system hosting veins of variable density, composition, orientation, and thickness are analysed for this purpose. The results are validated using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy-based mineral mapping techniques. We demonstrate that the use of hyperspectral scanning allows for faster, non-invasive and more efficient drill-core mapping, providing a useful tool for complementing core-logging performed by on-site geologists.",2019,2019-02-19 00:00:00,25.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9438d4b14e7fdd5a4e179a061136feda490b04bf

10.1109/TII.2020.3030620,Intersecting Machining Feature Localization and Recognition via Single Shot Multibox Detector,"In Industrie 4.0, machines are expected to become autonomous, self-aware and self-correcting. One important step in the area of manufacturing is feature recognition that aims to detect all the machining features from a 3-D model. In this research area, recognizing and locating a wide variety of highly intersecting features are extremely challenging as the topology information of features is substantially damaged because of the feature intersection. Motivated by the single shot multibox detector (SSD), this article presents a novel deep learning approach named SsdNet to tackle the machining feature localization and recognition problem. The typical SSD is designed for 2-D image objection detection rather than 3-D feature recognition. Therefore, the network architecture and output of SSD are modified to fulfil the purpose of this research. In addition, some advanced techniques are also utilized to further enhance the recognition performance. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art feature recognition performance (95.20% F-score), localization performance (90.62% F-score), and recognition efficiency (243.85 ms per model).",2021,2021-05-01 00:00:00,27.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c7489d368bc958a031871b47d3c232273511486

10.1007/s10845-020-01533-w,A novel learning-based feature recognition method using multiple sectional view representation,"In computer-aided design (CAD) and process planning (CAPP), feature recognition is an essential task which identifies the feature type of a 3D model for computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). In general, traditional rule-based feature recognition methods are computationally expensive, and dependent on surface or feature types. In addition, it is quite challenging to design proper rules to recognise intersecting features. Recently, a learning-based method, named FeatureNet, has been proposed for both single and multi-feature recognition. This is a general purpose algorithm which is capable of dealing with any type of features and surfaces. However, thousands of annotated training samples for each feature are required for training to achieve a high single feature recognition accuracy, which makes this technique difficult to use in practice. In addition, experimental results suggest that multi-feature recognition part in this approach works very well on intersecting features with small overlapping areas, but may fail when recognising highly intersecting features. To address the above issues, a deep learning framework based on multiple sectional view (MSV) representation named MsvNet is proposed for feature recognition. In the MsvNet, MSVs of a 3D model are collected as the input of the deep network, and the information achieved from different views are combined via the neural network for recognition. In addition to MSV representation, some advanced learning strategies (e.g. transfer learning, data augmentation) are also employed to minimise the number of training samples and training time. For multi-feature recognition, a novel view-based feature segmentation and recognition algorithm is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve the state-of-the-art single feature performance on the FeatureNet dataset with only a very small number of training samples (e.g. 8–32 samples for each feature), and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based multi-feature recognition method in terms of recognition performances.",2020,2020-01-22 00:00:00,69.0,74.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35487326d3292391f4caac245dc8d9ec49159782

This study aims to enhance Groundwater Pollution Risk (GwPR) mapping by integrating the DRASTIC index with machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), alongside hydrogeochemical investigations, to promote sustainable water management in Kerman Province. The RF model achieved the highest accuracy with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.995 in predicting GwPR, outperforming BRT (0.988), SVM (0.977), MARS (0.951), and GLM (0.887). The RF-based map identified new high-vulnerability zones in the northeast and northwest and showed an expanded moderate vulnerability zone, covering 48.46% of the study area. Analysis revealed exceedances of WHO standards for total hardness (TH), sodium, sulfates, chlorides, and electrical conductivity (EC) in these high-vulnerability areas, indicating contamination from mineralized aquifers and unsustainable agricultural practices. The findings underscore the RF model’s effectiveness in groundwater prediction and highlight the need for stricter monitoring and management, including regulating groundwater extraction and improving water use efficiency in riverine aquifers.",2024,2024-09-27 00:00:00,10.0,70.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ad9e005beb49c3ffd7d420519b3c078fb094163

10.1038/s41598-024-70610-4,Machine learning predictive insight of water pollution and groundwater quality in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia,"This study presents an innovative approach for predicting water and groundwater quality indices (WQI and GWQI) in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, addressing critical challenges of scarcity and pollution in arid regions. Recent literature highlights the increasing attention towards WQI based on water pollution index (WPI) and GWQI as essential tools for simplifying complex hydrogeological data, thereby facilitating effective groundwater management and protection. Unlike previous works, the present research introduces a novel hybrid method that integrates non-parametric kernel Gaussian learning (GPR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and decision tree (DT) algorithms. This approach marks the first application of a non-parametric kernel for groundwater quality pollution index prediction in Saudi Arabia, offering a significant advancement in the field. Through laboratory analysis and the combination of various machine learning (ML) techniques, this study enhances prediction capabilities, particularly for unmonitored sites in arid and semi-arid regions. The study’s objectives include feature engineering based on dependency sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential variables affecting WQI and GWQI, and the development of predictive models using ANFIS, GPR, and DT for both indices. Furthermore, it aims to assess the impact of different data portions on WQI and GWQI predictions, exploring data divisions such as (70% / 30%), (60% / 40%), and (80% / 20%) for training and testing phase, respectively. By filling a critical gap in water resource management, this research offers significant implications for the prediction of water quality in regions facing similar environmental challenges. Through its innovative methodology and comprehensive analysis, this study contributes to the broader effort of managing and protecting water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. The result proved that GPR-M1 exhibited exceptional testing phase accuracy with RMSE = 0.0169 for GWQI. Similarly, for WPI, the ANFIS-M1 achieved high testing predictive skills with RMSE = 0.0401. The results emphasize the critical role of data quality and quantity in training for enhancing model robustness and prediction precision in water quality assessment.",2024,2024-08-28 00:00:00,10.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f065177465f2434abb101377e4ecce338a41b90b

The study focused on examining three types of water-cement ratio (W/C) conditions, with a constant addition of cement-based binder (C). Due to the soft clay nature of the Saga Lowland, frequent ground settlement and deformation occur, necessitating measures to prevent adverse effects on the surrounding environment. The objective of this research is to provide a valuable approach to optimizing the quality of the improved columns while minimizing ground displacement in an environmentally considerate manner. In Saga Lowland, it is common to fix the W/C ratio at 1.0 and vary the cement content. Through experimental construction for improved columns on the field, the study confirmed that W/C values of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 influence the quality of the improved structure. A higher W/C value of 1.5 resulted in a more fluid cement slurry due to a higher injection rate (IR = 23.9%), as evidenced by statistical analysis revealing higher average unconfined compressive strength ( $$\overline{{q }_{u}}$$
 
 
 q

 ¯
 
 ), and a lower coefficient of variation (CV). The defective rate of 10% (qudr) from the design standard strength shows that values are lowest for Case 2, followed by Case 3 and then Case 1. Comparing the values of Case 2 and Case 3, it is observed that in Case 3, with a higher W/C, the CV is lower.. Regarding horizontal ground displacement (Sh), Case 3 exhibited a Sh value of 2.0 to 6.5 mm, significantly lower than Saga prefecture standards (20 mm). This outcome is attributed to reduced viscosity during mixing, leading to improved fluidity and minimal lateral displacement of the soil–cement columns (which often results in lateral ground uplift). Even though with a higher W/C = 1.5, the implementation cost remains the same, but the constructed structure would be of higher quality and smaller displacement, with the overall structure corresponding to the standard quality. The study includes the specific geotechnical conditions of the Saga Lowland and the scope of experimentation. Nonetheless, in terms of the applicability and optimization of DMM in Saga Lowland, the findings provide practical guidance for engineers in selecting W/C ratio and IR during construction for future DMM implementations, thereby contributing to the development of long-lasting infrastructure and sustainable societal development.",2024,2024-04-02 00:00:00,6.0,10.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ffc624e21fb0de0069d2d5150ee6d6053c550816

Language identification (“LI”) is the problem of determining the natural language that a document or part thereof is written in. Automatic LI has been extensively researched for over fifty years. Today, LI is a key part of many text processing pipelines, as text processing techniques generally assume that the language of the input text is known. Research in this area has recently been especially active. This article provides a brief history of LI research, and an extensive survey of the features and methods used in the LI literature. We describe the features and methods using a unified notation, to make the relationships between methods clearer. We discuss evaluation methods, applications of LI, as well as off-the-shelfLI systems that do not require training by the end user. Finally, we identify open issues, survey the work to date on each issue, and propose future directions for research in LI.

We overcome this through a “mostly-automated” approach to gathering language-labeled Twitter messages for evaluating language identification. We present the method to construct this dataset, as well as empirical results over existing datasets and off-theshelf language identifiers.

Each type of bark made by dogs has a distinct context. The classification of dog bark pattern will aid in the understanding of barking action. In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used to analyze the pattern of barking from two different dog species: Rajapalayam Hound and Kombai Hound. The objective is to find the context of the dog barking pattern based on various real-time scenarios, including whether the dogs are alone, looking at strangers, or showing an eagerness to fight. The barks of the dogs were recorded inside the house under different scenarios, such as while identifying the owner or strangers. Machine learning algorithms, such as the reinforcement learning method, were used in predicting and classifying the dog sounds. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning that will generate the next best action for the given state. It is a model-free learning used to find the best course of dog action for the given current state of the dog. The Q-learning algorithm had been used in improving the prediction of dog sounds by updating the values of learning, where the values with the highest reward were taken into consideration. In total, 6171 barks were collected from the dogs chosen for study, and the proposed approach achieved a correct prediction accuracy of 85.19% of the dog sounds.",2022,2022-10-21 00:00:00,2.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/746805238ec86d890b1c01156f58bb23ae4331fc

In this work, we propose a deep-learning-assisted implementation incorporating a wearable device, a base station, a mobile application, and a cloud-based infrastructure that can first monitor in real-time the activity, the audio signals, and the location of a SaR dog, and second, recognize and alert the rescuing team whenever the SaR dog spots a victim. For this purpose, we employed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) both for the activity recognition and the sound classification, which are trained using data from inertial sensors, such as 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope and from the wearable’s microphone, respectively. The developed deep learning models were deployed on the wearable device, while the overall proposed implementation was validated in two discrete search and rescue scenarios, managing to successfully spot the victim (i.e., obtained F1-score more than 99%) and inform the rescue team in real-time for both scenarios.",2022,2022-01-27 00:00:00,25.0,52.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/773f1fcbaa6b5752c098766e3423e5ebfc7e4d50

With many independent teams working in different research areas, shared standards become an essential safeguard to ensure compliance with state-of-the-art methods allowing appropriate comparison of results across studies and potential integration and combination of extraction and recognition systems. In this paper we propose a basic standard acoustic parameter set for various areas of automatic voice analysis, such as paralinguistic or clinical speech analysis. In contrast to a large brute-force parameter set, we present a minimalistic set of voice parameters here. These were selected based on a) their potential to index affective physiological changes in voice production, b) their proven value in former studies as well as their automatic extractability, and c) their theoretical significance. The set is intended to provide a common baseline for evaluation of future research and eliminate differences caused by varying parameter sets or even different implementations of the same parameters.

10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01582,Tracking the evolutionary origins of dog-human cooperation: the “Canine Cooperation Hypothesis”,"At present, beyond the fact that dogs can be easier socialized with humans than wolves, we know little about the motivational and cognitive effects of domestication. Despite this, it has been suggested that during domestication dogs have become socially more tolerant and attentive than wolves. These two characteristics are crucial for cooperation, and it has been argued that these changes allowed dogs to successfully live and work with humans. However, these domestication hypotheses have been put forward mainly based on dog-wolf differences reported in regard to their interactions with humans. Thus, it is possible that these differences reflect only an improved capability of dogs to accept humans as social partners instead of an increase of their general tolerance, attentiveness and cooperativeness. At the Wolf Science Center, in order to detangle these two explanations, we raise and keep dogs and wolves similarly socializing them with conspecifics and humans and then test them in interactions not just with humans but also conspecifics. When investigating attentiveness toward human and conspecific partners using different paradigms, we found that the wolves were at least as attentive as the dogs to their social partners and their actions. Based on these findings and the social ecology of wolves, we propose the Canine Cooperation Hypothesis suggesting that wolves are characterized with high social attentiveness and tolerance and are highly cooperative. This is in contrast with the implications of most domestication hypotheses about wolves. We argue, however, that these characteristics of wolves likely provided a good basis for the evolution of dog-human cooperation.",2015,2015-01-15 00:00:00,110.0,109.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b96569f6db12c304b2834a73a083b00caebbd023

10.3390/molecules27206795,Preprocessing NIR Spectra for Aquaphotomics,"Even though NIR spectroscopy is based on the Beer–Lambert law, which clearly relates the concentration of the absorbing elements with the absorbance, the measured spectra are subject to spurious signals, such as additive and multiplicative effects. The use of NIR spectra, therefore, requires a preprocessing step. This article reviews the main preprocessing methods in the light of aquaphotomics. Simple methods for visualizing the spectra are proposed in order to guide the user in the choice of the best preprocessing. The most common chemometrics preprocessing are presented and illustrated by three real datasets. Some preprocessing aims to produce a spectrum as close as possible to the absorbance that would have been measured under ideal conditions and is very useful for the establishment of an aquagram. Others, dedicated to the improvement of the resolution of the spectra, are very useful for the identification of the peaks. Finally, special attention is given to the problem of reducing multiplicative effects and to the potential pitfalls of some very popular methods in chemometrics.

10.3322/caac.21763,"Cancer statistics, 2023","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus‐associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.",2023,2023-01-01 00:00:00,10104.0,124.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb004c1bd6796118879563b226def1973c41531c

Turn measures and activity rates were quantified. Fall incidence within 12 months from continuous monitoring defined fall status, with 7/153 prospective fallers/non-fallers. Based on the analysis of 718,582 turns, prospective fallers turned less frequently, took longer to turn, and were less consistent in turn angle (p = 0.007, 0.025, and 0.038, respectively). Prospective fallers also walked slower and spent less time walking and turning and more time engaged in sedentary behavior (p = 0.043, 0.012, and 0.015, respectively). Individuals experiencing decline in the control of gait and/or turning may attempt to reduce their risk of falling by limiting their exposure and implementing cautionary movement strategies while turning.

10.1109/JTEHM.2016.2620177,Sit-to-Stand Transition Reveals Acute Fall Risk in Activities of Daily Living,"The focus of this paper was on finding wrist sensor-derived features for detecting highly acute fall risk from the sit-to-stand transitions performed in a non-ambulatory environment. Furthermore, the influence of the dominant and non-dominant hand on these features was investigated. A cohort of 174 older subjects was monitored for seven consecutive days in their home setting by using inertial sensors attached at the wrist. Based on the reported falls during a one-month follow-up phase, two groups were defined. Twenty-one time and frequency domain features were implemented for the quantitative assessment of extracted sit-to-stand transitions. The statistical analysis yielded two features that could convincingly distinguish fallers from non-fallers for the dominant hand, and six for the non-dominant hand. A novel feature, energy of the applied support during standing up, showed statistically good performance independently of on which hand the sensor node was worn, as well as for the dominant and non-dominant hand (p <; 0.014, p <; 0.027, and p <; 0.020, respectively). This paper overcomes limitations of clinical tests and shows a reliable application of wrist-worn bands in terms of assessment of highly acute fall risk. In addition, it reveals the sit-to-stand transition as a potential assessment source for the wrist-worn devices in the elderly population. Early assessment of the risk of falling in a widely accepted and non-stigmatized manner has the ability to bring crucial changes in fall prevention strategies, reducing the number of falls and the fall rate.",2016,2016-12-01 00:00:00,33.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c2cbccb60af5ebcde02016b06879bd26252fef6

10.1002/asi.24493,Lexical data augmentation for sentiment analysis,"Machine learning methods, especially deep learning models, have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks including sentiment analysis. However, deep learning models are more demanding for training data. Data augmentation techniques are widely used to generate new instances based on modifications to existing data or relying on external knowledge bases to address annotated data scarcity, which hinders the full potential of machine learning techniques. This paper presents our work using part‐of‐speech (POS) focused lexical substitution for data augmentation (PLSDA) to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms in sentiment analysis. We exploit POS information to identify words to be replaced and investigate different augmentation strategies to find semantically related substitutions when generating new instances. The choice of POS tags as well as a variety of strategies such as semantic‐based substitution methods and sampling methods are discussed in detail. Performance evaluation focuses on the comparison between PLSDA and two previous lexical substitution‐based data augmentation methods, one of which is thesaurus‐based, and the other is lexicon manipulation based. Our approach is tested on five English sentiment analysis benchmarks: SST‐2, MR, IMDB, Twitter, and AirRecord. Hyperparameters such as the candidate similarity threshold and number of newly generated instances are optimized. Results show that six classifiers (SVM, LSTM, BiLSTM‐AT, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers [BERT], XLNet, and RoBERTa) trained with PLSDA achieve accuracy improvement of more than 0.6% comparing to two previous lexical substitution methods averaged on five benchmarks. Introducing POS constraint and well‐designed augmentation strategies can improve the reliability of lexical data augmentation methods. Consequently, PLSDA significantly improves the performance of sentiment analysis algorithms.",2021,2021-06-17 00:00:00,29.0,49.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff15e5a042c5a987b20c13377894762e70f48175

In NLP similar results are reported most commonly for low data regimes, non-pretrained models, or situationally for pretrained models. In this paper we ask how effective these techniques really are when applied to pretrained transformers. Using two popular varieties of task-agnostic data augmentation (not tailored to any particular task), Easy Data Augmentation (Wei andZou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrichet al., 2015), we conduct a systematic examination of their effects across 5 classification tasks, 6 datasets, and 3 variants of modern pretrained transformers, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. We observe a negative result, finding that techniques which previously reported strong improvements for non-pretrained models fail to consistently improve performance for pretrained transformers, even when training data is limited. We hope this empirical analysis helps inform practitioners where data augmentation techniques may confer improvements.",2020,2020-10-05 00:00:00,80.0,35.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f10f898e42973e7c3dee36ccb24d96e39e4583cc

10.3390/s17112557,Super-Resolution of Plant Disease Images for the Acceleration of Image-based Phenotyping and Vigor Diagnosis in Agriculture,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) are a very promising branch of technology, and they have been utilized in agriculture—in cooperation with image processing technologies—for phenotyping and vigor diagnosis. One of the problems in the utilization of UAVs for agricultural purposes is the limitation in flight time. It is necessary to fly at a high altitude to capture the maximum number of plants in the limited time available, but this reduces the spatial resolution of the captured images. In this study, we applied a super-resolution method to the low-resolution images of tomato diseases to recover detailed appearances, such as lesions on plant organs. We also conducted disease classification using high-resolution, low-resolution, and super-resolution images to evaluate the effectiveness of super-resolution methods in disease classification. Our results indicated that the super-resolution method outperformed conventional image scaling methods in spatial resolution enhancement of tomato disease images. The results of disease classification showed that the accuracy attained was also better by a large margin with super-resolution images than with low-resolution images. These results indicated that our approach not only recovered the information lost in low-resolution images, but also exerted a beneficial influence on further image analysis. The proposed approach will accelerate image-based phenotyping and vigor diagnosis in the field, because it not only saves time to capture images of a crop in a cultivation field but also secures the accuracy of these images for further analysis.",2017,2017-11-01 00:00:00,92.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7fe54fcdd2d720d04588fee3645f4399dcab0226
10.3390/s17092022,A Robust Deep-Learning-Based Detector for Real-Time Tomato Plant Diseases and Pests Recognition,"Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",2017,2017-09-01 00:00:00,1087.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/886674a5abae3c9bfd262006c67d4ba078e1462b

General population singleton pregnancies between 18 + 0 and 24 + 6 weeks’ gestation were assessed prospectively at two centers. Cervical ultrasound images were evaluated and the occurrence of sPTB before weeks 37 + 0 and 34 + 0 were recorded. CL was measured on-site. The automated texture analysis test was applied offline to all images. Their performance to predict the occurrence of sPTB before 37 + 0 and 34 + 0 weeks was evaluated separately and in combination on 633 recruited patients. AUC for sPTB prediction before weeks 37 and 34 respectively were as follows: 55.5% and 65.3% for CL, 63.4% and 66.3% for texture analysis, 67.5% and 76.7% when combined. The new test improved detection rates of CL at similar low FPR. Combining the two increased detection rate compared to CL alone from 13.0 to 30.4% for sPTB < 37 and from 14.3 to 42.9% sPTB < 34. Texture analysis of cervical ultrasound improved sPTB detection rate compared to cervical length for similar FPR, and the two combined together increased significantly prediction performance.

10.3389/frai.2021.622616,A Machine Learning Approach to Monitor the Emergence of Late Intrauterine Growth Restriction,"Late intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a fetal pathological condition characterized by chronic hypoxia secondary to placental insufficiency, resulting in an abnormal rate of fetal growth. This pathology has been associated with increased fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In standard clinical practice, late IUGR diagnosis can only be suspected in the third trimester and ultimately confirmed at birth. This study presents a radial basis function support vector machine (RBF-SVM) classification based on quantitative features extracted from fetal heart rate (FHR) signals acquired using routine cardiotocography (CTG) in a population of 160 healthy and 102 late IUGR fetuses. First, the individual performance of each time, frequency, and nonlinear feature was tested. To improve the unsatisfactory results of univariate analysis we firstly adopted a Recursive Feature Elimination approach to select the best subset of FHR-based parameters contributing to the discrimination of healthy vs. late IUGR fetuses. A fine tuning of the RBF-SVM model parameters resulted in a satisfactory classification performance in the training set (accuracy 0.93, sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.84). Comparable results were obtained when applying the model on a totally independent testing set. This investigation supports the use of a multivariate approach for the in utero identification of late IUGR condition based on quantitative FHR features encompassing different domains. The proposed model allows describing the relationships among features beyond the traditional linear approaches, thus improving the classification performance. This framework has the potential to be proposed as a screening tool for the identification of late IUGR fetuses.",2021,2021-03-08 00:00:00,21.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/477cc5801615317ab1fe5e4ca392ae78ccd68ff7

Methods Data came from 3159 obstetric patients and their newborns enrolled in a multi-center retrospective study. Variable importance, the effect of a variable on model performance, was used for identifying major predictors of newborn’s BMI among ultrasound measures and maternal/delivery information. The ultrasound measures included biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) taken three times during the week 21 - week 35 of gestational age and once in the week 36 or later. Results Based on variable importance from the random forest, major predictors of newborn’s BMI were the first AC and EFW in the week 36 or later, gestational age at delivery, the first AC during the week 21 - the week 35, maternal BMI at delivery, maternal weight at delivery and the first BPD in the week 36 or later. For predicting newborn’s BMI, linear regression (2.0744) and the random forest (2.1610) were better than artificial neural networks with one, two and three hidden layers (150.7100, 154.7198 and 152.5843, respectively) in the mean squared error. Conclusions This is the first machine-learning study with 64 clinical and sonographic markers for the prediction of newborns’ BMI. The week 36 or later is the most effective period for taking the ultrasound measures and AC and EFW are the best predictors of newborn’s BMI alongside gestational age at delivery and maternal BMI at delivery.",2021,2021-03-02 00:00:00,12.0,28.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f819baf2d744baf37878240cfb83dba7bccc316

Methods Images of fetal faces with sonography obtained from outpatient pregnant women with a singleton fetus were enrolled in routine conventional practice from 19 to 38 weeks of gestation from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, with completely de-identified data. The images were classified into seven categories, such as eye blinking, mouthing, face without any expression, scowling, smiling, tongue expulsion, and yawning. The category in which the number of fetuses was less than 10 was eliminated before preparation. Next, we created a deep learning AI classifier with the data. Statistical values such as accuracy for the test dataset and the AI confidence score profiles for each category per image for all data were obtained. Results The number of fetuses/images in the rated categories were 14/147, 23/302, 33/320, 8/55, and 10/72 for eye blinking, mouthing, face without any expression, scowling, and yawning, respectively. The accuracy of the AI fetal facial expression for the entire test data set was 0.985. The accuracy/sensitivity/specificity values were 0.996/0.993/1.000, 0.992/0.986/1.000, 0.985/1.000/0.979, 0.996/0.888/1.000, and 1.000/1.000/1.000 for the eye blinking, mouthing, face without any expression, scowling categories, and yawning, respectively.

10.5468/ogs.20248,The application of machine learning for predicting recurrence in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer: a pilot study,"Objective Most women with early stage endometrial cancer have a favorable prognosis. However, there is a subset of patients who develop recurrence. In addition to the pathological stage, clinical and therapeutic factors affect the probability of recurrence. Machine learning is a subtype of artificial intelligence that is considered effective for predictive tasks. We tried to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer using machine learning methods based on clinical data. Methods We enrolled 75 patients with early stage endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I or II) who had received surgical treatment at our institute. A total of 5 machine learning classifiers were used, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and boosted tree, to predict the recurrence based on 16 parameters (age, body mass index, gravity/parity, hypertension/diabetic, stage, histological type, grade, surgical content and adjuvant chemotherapy). We analyzed the classification accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC). Results The highest accuracy was 0.82 for SVM, followed by 0.77 for RF, 0.74 for LR, 0.66 for DT, and 0.66 for boosted trees. The highest AUC was 0.53 for LR, followed by 0.52 for boosted trees, 0.48 for DT, and 0.47 for RF. Therefore, the best predictive model for this analysis was LR. Conclusion The performance of the machine learning classifiers was not optimal owing to the small size of the dataset.

Objectives This work aimed to establish effective models to predict early GDM. Methods Pregnancy data for 73 variables during the first trimester were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Based on a machine learning (ML)-driven feature selection method, 17 variables were selected for early GDM prediction. To facilitate clinical application, 7 variables were selected from the 17-variable panel. Advanced ML approaches were then employed using the 7-variable data set and the 73-variable data set to build models predicting early GDM for different situations, respectively. Results A total of 16 819 and 14 992 cases were included in the training and testing sets, respectively. Using 73 variables, the deep neural network model achieved high discriminative power, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.80. The 7-variable logistic regression (LR) model also achieved effective discriminate power (AUC = 0.77). Low body mass index (BMI) (≤ 17) was related to an increased risk of GDM, compared to a BMI in the range of 17 to 18 (minimum risk interval) (11.8% vs 8.7%, P = .09). Total 3,3,5′-triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxin (T4) were superior to free T3 and free T4 in predicting GDM. Lipoprotein(a) was demonstrated a promising predictive value (AUC = 0.66). Conclusions We employed ML models that achieved high accuracy in predicting GDM in early pregnancy. A clinically cost-effective 7-variable LR model was simultaneously developed. The relationship of GDM with thyroxine and BMI was investigated in the Chinese population.",2020,2020-12-22 00:00:00,112.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3bcd9d7b664046c7e5febfb117e4e76bc5b8162

With an emissive bendable organic crystalline material, here we propose that organic crystals can be used as mechanically robust and compliant fluorescence-based thermal sensors with wide range of temperature coverage and complete retention of mechanical elasticity. The exemplary material described remains elastically bendable and shows highly linear correlation with the emission wavelength and intensity between 77 K to 277 K, while it also transduces its own fluorescence in active waveguiding mode. This universal new approach expands the materials available for optical thermal sensing to a vast number of organic crystals as a new class of engineering materials and opens opportunities for the design of lightweight, organic fluorescence-based thermal sensors that can operate under extreme temperature conditions such as are the ones that will be encountered in future space exploration missions.

10.1038/s41598-024-74309-4,Impact of coupled input data source-resolution and aggregation on contributions of high-yielding traits to simulated wheat yield,"High-yielding traits can potentially improve yield performance under climate change. However, data for these traits are limited to specific field sites. Despite this limitation, field-scale calibrated crop models for high-yielding traits are being applied over large scales using gridded weather and soil datasets. This study investigates the implications of this practice. The SIMPLACE modeling platform was applied using field, 1 km, 25 km, and 50 km input data resolution and sources, with 1881 combinations of three traits [radiation use efficiency (RUE), light extinction coefficient (K), and fruiting efficiency (FE)] for the period 2001–2010 across Germany. Simulations at the grid level were aggregated to the administrative units, enabling the quantification of the aggregation effect. The simulated yield increased by between 1.4 and 3.1 t ha− 1 with a maximum RUE trait value, compared to a control cultivar. No significant yield improvement (< 0.4 t ha− 1) was observed with increases in K and FE alone. Utilizing field-scale input data showed the greatest yield improvement per unit increment in RUE. Resolution of water related inputs (soil characteristics and precipitation) had a notably higher impact on simulated yield than of temperature. However, it did not alter the effects of high-yielding traits on yield. Simulated yields were only slightly affected by data aggregation for the different trait combinations. Warm-dry conditions diminished the benefits of high-yielding traits, suggesting that benefits from high-yielding traits depend on environments. The current findings emphasize the critical role of input data resolution and source in quantifying a large-scale impact of high-yielding traits.

 Wheat's nutritional value is critical for human nutrition and food security. However, more attention is needed, particularly regarding the content and concentration of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), especially in the context of climate change (CC) impacts. To address this, various controlled field experiments were conducted, involving the cultivation of three wheat cultivars over three growing seasons at multiple locations with different soil and climate conditions under varying Fe and Zn treatments. The yield and yield attributes, including nutritional values such as nitrogen (N), Fe and Zn, from these experiments were integrated with national yield statistics from other locations to train and test different machine learning (ML) algorithms. Automated ML leveraging a large number of models, outperformed traditional ML models, enabling the training and testing of numerous models, and achieving robust predictions of grain yield (GY) (R2 > 0.78), N (R2 > 0.75), Fe (R2 > 0.71) and Zn (R2 > 0.71) through a stacked ensemble of all models. The ensemble model predicted GY, N, Fe, and Zn at spatial explicit in the mid-century (2020-2050) using three Global Circulation Models (GCMs): GFDL-ESM4, HadGEM3-GC31-MM, and MRI-ESM2-0 under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) specifically SSP2-45 and SSP5-85, from the downscaled NEX-GDDP-CMIP6. Averaged across different GCMs and SSPs, CC is projected to increase wheat yield by 4.5 %, and protein concentration by 0.8 % with high variability. However, it is expected to decrease Fe concentration by 5.5 %, and Zn concentration by 4.5 % in the mid-century (2020-2050) relative to the historical period (1980-2010). Positive impacts of CC on wheat yield encountered by negative impacts on nutritional concentrations, further exacerbating challenges related to food security and nutrition.",2024,2024-08-30 00:00:00,5.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ffb55e7eb9abfc84f9528e86fdbf6c6bfa10625

The increasing adoption of MLSs in safety critical domains such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance has fostered much attention towards the quality assurance of such systems. Despite the advances in software testing, MLSs bring novel and unprecedented challenges, since their behaviour is defined jointly by the code that implements them and the data used for training them. To identify the existing solutions for functional testing of MLSs, and classify them from three different perspectives: (1) the context of the problem they address, (2) their features, and (3) their empirical evaluation. To report demographic information about the ongoing research. To identify open challenges for future research. We conducted a systematic mapping study about testing techniques for MLSs driven by 33 research questions. We followed existing guidelines when defining our research protocol so as to increase the repeatability and reliability of our results. We identified 70 relevant primary studies, mostly published in the last years. We identified 11 problems addressed in the literature. We investigated multiple aspects of the testing approaches, such as the used/proposed adequacy criteria, the algorithms for test input generation, and the test oracles. The most active research areas in MLS testing address automated scenario/input generation and test oracle creation.

10.1038/s41467-020-20310-0,The role of water in host-guest interaction,"One of the main applications of atomistic computer simulations is the calculation of ligand binding free energies. The accuracy of these calculations depends on the force field quality and on the thoroughness of configuration sampling. Sampling is an obstacle in simulations due to the frequent appearance of kinetic bottlenecks in the free energy landscape. Very often this difficulty is circumvented by enhanced sampling techniques. Typically, these techniques depend on the introduction of appropriate collective variables that are meant to capture the system’s degrees of freedom. In ligand binding, water has long been known to play a key role, but its complex behaviour has proven difficult to fully capture. In this paper we combine machine learning with physical intuition to build a non-local and highly efficient water-describing collective variable. We use it to study a set of host-guest systems from the SAMPL5 challenge. We obtain highly accurate binding free energies and good agreement with experiments. The role of water during the binding process is then analysed in some detail. Computational approaches to predict water’s role in host-ligand binding attract a great deal of attention. Here the authors use a metadynamics enhanced sampling method and machine learning to compute binding energies for host-guest systems from the SAMPL5 challenge and provide details of water structural changes.",2020,2020-06-23 00:00:00,48.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fd5b2146a2e93f3422b4de614d3290a6395a8d5
10.3389/fmolb.2020.00106,On Calculating Free Energy Differences Using Ensembles of Transition Paths,"The free energy of a process is the fundamental quantity that determines its spontaneity or propensity at a given temperature. In particular, the binding free energy of a drug candidate to its biomolecular target is used as an objective quantity in drug design. Recently, binding kinetics—rates of association (kon) and dissociation (koff)—have also demonstrated utility for their ability to predict efficacy and in some cases have been shown to be more predictive than the binding free energy alone. Some methods exist to calculate binding kinetics from molecular simulations, although these are typically more difficult to calculate than the binding affinity as they depend on details of the transition path ensemble. Assessing these rate constants can be difficult, due to uncertainty in the definition of the bound and unbound states, large error bars and the lack of experimental data. As an additional consistency check, rate constants from simulation can be used to calculate free energies (using the log of their ratio) which can then be compared to free energies obtained experimentally or using alchemical free energy perturbation. However, in this calculation it is not straightforward to account for common, practical details such as the finite simulation volume or the particular definition of the “bound” and “unbound” states. Here we derive a set of correction terms that can be applied to calculations of binding free energies using full reactive trajectories. We apply these correction terms to revisit the calculation of binding free energies from rate constants for a host-guest system that was part of a blind prediction challenge, where significant deviations were observed between free energies calculated with rate ratios and those calculated from alchemical perturbation. The correction terms combine to significantly decrease the error with respect to computational benchmarks, from 3.4 to 0.76 kcal/mol. Although these terms were derived with weighted ensemble simulations in mind, some of the correction terms are generally applicable to free energies calculated using physical pathways via methods such as Markov state modeling, metadynamics, milestoning, or umbrella sampling.",2020,2020-06-05 00:00:00,33.0,73.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1897d451b669ea9e69484a31a44aa2175cb33449

10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01142,Potential Mean Force from Umbrella Sampling Simulations: What Can We Learn and What Is Missed?,"Changes in free energy provide valuable information for molecular recognition, including both ligand-receptor binding thermodynamics and kinetics. Umbrella sampling (US), a widely used free energy calculation method, has long been used to explore the dissociation process of ligand-receptor systems and compute binding free energy. In existing publications, the binding free energy computed from the potential of mean force (PMF) with US simulation mostly yielded ""ball park"" values with experimental data. However, the computed PMF values are highly influenced by factors such as initial conformations and/or trajectories provided, the reaction coordinate, and sampling of conformational space in each US window. These critical factors have rarely been carefully studied. Here we used US to study the guest aspirin and 1-butanol dissociation processes of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and an inhibitor SB2 dissociation from a p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) complex. For β-CD, we used three different β-CD conformations to generate the dissociation path with US windows. For p38α, we generated the dissociation pathway by using accelerated molecular dynamics followed by conformational relaxing with short conventional MD, steered MD, and manual pulling. We found that, even for small β-CD complexes, different β-CD conformations altered the height of the PMF, but the pattern of PMF was not affected if the MD sampling in each US window was well-converged. Because changing the macrocyclic ring conformation needs to rotate dihedral angles in the ring, a bound ligand largely restrains the motion of cyclodextrin. Therefore, once a guest is in the binding site, cyclodextrin cannot freely change its initial conformation, resulting in different absolute heights of the PMF, which cannot be overcome by running excessively long MD simulations for each US window. Moreover, if the US simulations were not converged, the important barrier and minimum were missed. For ligand-protein systems, our studies also suggest that the dissociation trajectories modeled by an enhanced sampling method must maintain a natural molecular movement to avoid biased PMF plots when using US simulations.",2019,2019-02-27 00:00:00,116.0,64.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/802a7694244a73baed1a078354b8dea91e496b61

Thus, the modelling, characterization, classification, diagnosis, and analysis of such mental disorders bears great significance in medical research. Electroencephalogram records provide important information to improve clinical diagnosis and are very useful in the scientific community. In this work, electroencephalogram records and patient data from the Hospital Virgen de la Luz in Cuenca (Spain) were processed for a correct classification of bipolar disorders. This work implemented an innovative radial basis function-based neural network employing a fuzzy means algorithm. The results show that the proposed method is an effective approach for discrimination of two kinds of classes, i.e., bipolar disorder patients and healthy persons. The proposed algorithm achieved the best performance compared with other machine learning techniques such as Bayesian linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian naive Bayes, decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, or support vector machine, showing a very high accuracy close to 97%.

Currently, several approaches classified as electrical, magnetic, neuroimaging recordings and brain stimulations are available to obtain neural activity of the human brain. Among them, non-invasive methods like electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly employed, as they can provide a high degree of temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds) and acceptable space resolution. In addition, it is simple, quick, and does not create any physical harm or stress to patients. Concerning signal processing, once the neural signals are acquired, different procedures can be applied for feature extraction. In particular, brain signals are normally processed in time, frequency, and/or space domains. The features extracted are then used for signal classification depending on its characteristics such us the mean, variance or band power. The role of machine learning in this regard has become of key importance during the last years due to its high capacity to analyze complex amounts of data. The algorithms employed are generally classified in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement techniques.

Given that anxiety disorders are one of the most common comorbidities in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), this population is particularly vulnerable to mental stress, severely limiting overall quality of life. To prevent this, early stress quantification with machine learning (ML) and effective anxiety mitigation with non-pharmacological interventions are essential. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of exploiting electroencephalography (EEG) signals for stress assessment by comparing several ML classifiers, namely support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning methods. We trained a total of eleven subject-dependent models-four with conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) methods and seven with deep learning approaches-on the EEG of neurotypical ( n =5) and ASD ( n =8) participants performing alternating blocks of mental arithmetic stress induction, guided and unguided breathing. Our results show that a multiclass two-layer LSTM RNN deep learning classifier is capable of identifying mental stress from ongoing EEG with an overall accuracy of 93.27%.

In the era of digital medicine and precision therapeutics, new personalized treatment approaches are warranted for depression. Here, we use a combination of longitudinal ecological momentary assessments of depression, neurocognitive sampling synchronized with electroencephalography, and lifestyle data from wearables to generate individualized predictions of depressed mood over a 1-month time period. This study, thus, develops a systematic pipeline for N-of-1 personalized modeling of depression using multiple modalities of data. In the models, we integrate seven types of supervised machine learning (ML) approaches for each individual, including ensemble learning and regression-based methods. All models were verified using fourfold nested cross-validation. The best-fit as benchmarked by the lowest mean absolute percentage error, was obtained by a different type of ML model for each individual, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. The voting regressor, which is a composite strategy across ML models, was best performing on-average across subjects. However, the individually selected best-fit models still showed significantly less error than the voting regressor performance across subjects. For each individual’s best-fit personalized model, we further extracted top-feature predictors using Shapley statistics. Shapley values revealed distinct feature determinants of depression over time for each person ranging from co-morbid anxiety, to physical exercise, diet, momentary stress and breathing performance, sleep times, and neurocognition.

10.5194/amt-2021-233,Modelling the Spectral Shape of Continuous-Wave Lidar Measurements in a Turbulent Wind Tunnel,"Abstract. This paper describes the development of a model for the turbulence spectrum measured by a short-range, continuous-wave lidar. The lidar performance was assessed by measurements conducted with two WindScanners in an open jet wind tunnel equipped with an active grid, for a range of different turbulent wind conditions. A one-dimensional hot wire anemometer was used as a reference for characterising the lidar turbulence measurement. In addition to addressing the statistics, the correlation between the time series and the mean error on the wind speed, the lidar measurement turbulence spectrum is compared with a theoretical spectrum using Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A theoretical model for the probe length averaging effect is applied in the frequency domain, using a Lorentzian filter in combination with generated white noise, and evaluated by qualitatively matching the lidar measurement spectrum. High goodness of fit coefficients and low mean absolute errors between hot wire and WindScanner were observed for the measured time series. The correlation showed an inverse relationship with the prevalent turbulence intensity in the flow for cases with a comparable power spectrum shape. Larger flow structures can be captured more accurately by the lidar, whereas small-scale turbulent flow structures are partly filtered out as a result of the lidars' probe volume averaging. It is demonstrated that an accurate way to define the frequency at which the lidar power spectrum starts to deviate from the hot wire reference spectrum is the point at which the coherence drops below 0.5. This coherence-based cut-off frequency increases linearly with the mean wind speed and is generally an order of magnitude lower than the probe length cut-off frequency, estimated according to a simple model based on Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. A convincing match between the modelled and the actual WindScanner power spectrum was found for various different cases, which confirmed that the deviation of the lidar measurement power spectrum in the higher frequency range can be analytically explained and modelled as a combination of a Lorentzian probe length averaging effect and white noise in the lidar measurement.

The approach follows from the one-time construction of a high-dimensional parametric database of synthetic lidar spectra and subsequent processing with an existing QAQC technique. A model of the correspondence between the spectral shape and the associated residual errors due to non-ideal features is then developed for quantities of interest (QOIs) including the geometric median and spectral standard deviation of line-of-sight velocity. The model is preliminarily implemented within a neural network framework that is then applied in post-processing to sample returns from a DTU SpinnerLidar. The initial analysis uncovers the effects of specific sources of uncertainty in the context of both individual spectra and full-field maps of the measurement domain. The technique is described in terms of application to continuous wave (CW) lidar, though it is also relevant to pulsed lidar.",2020,2020-09-01 00:00:00,5.0,22.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/135f6152c270df1ade7211458aaf2a7fee594066

Interest is particularly directed at the structures and spectra which are influential for wake recovery and downstream turbine loading. This initial work is to determine the feasibility of using nacelle-mounted, continuous-wave lidars to measure and validate wake physics via comparisons of full actuator line simulation results with those obtained from a virtual lidar embedded within the computational domain. Analyses are conducted on the dominant large-scale flow structures via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and on the various scales of wake-added turbulence through spectral comparisons. The virtual lidar adequately reproduces spatial structures and energies compared to the full simulation results. Correction of the higher-frequency turbulence spectra for volume-averaging attenuation was most successful at locations where mean gradients were not severe. The results of this work will aid the design of experiments for validation of high-fidelity wake models.",2020,2020-09-01 00:00:00,4.0,24.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a2db715cd99fec8311ddd69547f306180d19a53

However, lidar measurements are always subject to uncertainties which are a result of the operating principle of the lidar. In this paper, we investigate and quantify the uncertainties associated with a turbine mounted “SpinnerLidar” in a high fidelity simulation framework. A sensitivity study is performed in order to investigate the effects of the spatio-temporal resolution, probe volume averaging and directional bias and recommendations are given for different lidar applications, e.g. turbulence research, load verification and control. It is seen that the SpinnerLidar in its current state is sufficient as a control input and for load verification studies especially capturing the rotational wind spectra very well. For estimating turbulence, it is better to operate the lidar at a much faster temporal sampling rate.",2020,2020-09-01 00:00:00,5.0,14.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57d5a1e9ab525b3c73da78ca377d1d78b8eb7af6
10.5194/amt-2020-88,Flywheel calibration of a continuous-wave coherent Doppler wind lidar,"Abstract. A rig for calibrating a continuous-wave coherent Doppler wind lidar has been constructed. The rig consists of a rotating flywheel on a frame together with an adjustable lidar telescope. The laser beam points toward the rim of the wheel in a plane perpendicular to the wheel's rotation axis, and it can be tilted up and down along the wheel's periphery and thereby measure different projections of the tangential speed. The angular speed of the wheel is measured using a high-precision measuring ring fitted to the periphery of the wheel and synchronously logged together with the lidar speed. A simple geometrical model shows that there is a linear relationship between the measured line-of-sight speed and the beam tilt angle, and this is utilised to extrapolate to the tangential speed as measured by the lidar. An analysis of the uncertainties based on the model shows that a standard uncertainty on the measurement of about 0.1 % can be achieved, but also that the main source of uncertainty is the width of the laser beam and its associated uncertainty. Measurements performed with different beam widths confirm this. Other measurements with a minimised beam radius show that the method in this case performs about equally well for all the tested reference speeds ranging from about 3 to 18 m s−1.

Due to the complexity, variability, and asymmetry of information, the construction of traditional information dissemination index systems demands excessive reliance on manual intervention, has large deviations, and is applied in a limited range. Such shortcomings cannot meet the requirements of constructing an objective, comprehensive, and highly credible index system. Therefore, we propose a method of constructing a multilevel and multigranular information dissemination index system with complex perspectives. In addition, we use the deep learning method of the convolutional neural network to extract the rich convolution features of public opinion events in the information dissemination process. Then, we train the weight, and it forms the corresponding weight of the information dissemination index systems. The experimental results prove that the method we use is superior to other methods and has better performance on the data set of a specific field.",2022,2022-03-07 00:00:00,4.0,23.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1787d48b0a5c72a4e10e7f005ab479682790918c

The consumer culture of livestream e-commerce is becoming popular in China. However, a report from Southern Finance Omnimedia Corp of China pointed out that among China's top 1,000 livestream sellers, the top 20 sellers have contributed to nearly half of the gross merchandise volume (GMV), using three major Chinese streaming platforms: Taobao, Douyin, and Kuaishou. Moreover, a novice in livestream e-commerce knows less about the important impact factors of the realm. Akin to the adage, “well aware is well prepared,” knowing more about the influencing factors of livestream e-commerce more will be the chances to promote the commercial value. A benchmark research is needed to systematically trace out the most important and influencing factors and to make possible the rising of selling with less effort, hence this study. The research intends to sort out the relevant influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce by reviewing previous related literature. Then, through the Delphi method, eight experts constructed the 14 main influencing factors that affect consumers’ shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce. Through DEMATEL-ANP, we can not only find the key factors but also sort out the causal relationship between the main key factors, forming a preliminary evaluation model of the commercial value of livestream sellers. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) of these impact factors found that “seller popularity” is the most critical factor affecting consumers’ shopping motivation. At the same time, product discounts, product quality, and the attractiveness of the sellers are being included in effects by the “seller popularity.” The investigation followed in this study revealed that characteristics of the livestream seller are one of the most influencing factor achieving a total weight of 0.3020, whereas the streaming platform is the least influencing factor (total weight is 0.1333). The assessment made the study explore the sustainability of livestream e-commerce in China, and the proposed evaluation model can be used for the preliminary business value evaluation of people engaged in livestream sellers and related industries.",2022,2022-02-21 00:00:00,14.0,87.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9710f7a0bf137cf2610bc6b1ebcf5319b1cb711e

We propose the LDA-ARMA deep neural network for dynamic presentation and fine-grained categorization of a public opinion events. This was applied to a huge quantity of online public opinion texts in a complicated setting and integrated the proposed sentiment measurement algorithm. To begin, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to extract information about the topic of comments. The autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) was then utilized to perform multidimensional sentiment analysis and evolution prediction on large-scale textual data related to COVID-19 published by netizens from Wuhan and other countries on Sina Weibo. The results show that Wuhan netizens paid more attention to the development of the situation, treatment measures, and policies related to COVID-19 than other issues, and were under greater emotional pressure, whereas netizens in the rest of the country paid more attention to the overall COVID-19 prevention and control, and were more positive and optimistic with the assistance of the government and NGOs. The average error in predicting public opinion sentiment was less than 5.64%, demonstrating that this approach may be effectively applied to the analysis of large-scale online public sentiment evolution.",2021,2021-09-04 00:00:00,24.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/632b89ad9807650c69e4ccaa00d5f6231df451dc
10.3934/mbe.2021341,Research on public opinion guidance of converging media based on AHP and transmission dynamics.,"In the 5G era, media convergence and technological updates lead to tremendous changes in the dissemination of public opinion information. The guidance of public opinion in the converged media environment is a new research topic. Users participate in the discussion of different media, and flow in and out from different media, which gradually generate a new complex dynamics model of the dissemination of public opinion information. An index system for evaluating the influence of converged media communication that combines the advantages of traditional media and new media is constructed. We use AHP to determine the index weights in the evaluation system and conduct consistency tests. The final weight of each media is determined through the combination of subjective and objective methods, which provides data supports for later determining the participation of various media in the dissemination process of public opinion information. Based on the SIR model, a UCIR (unknown-contact-infected-recovered) dynamic model is established. The simulation results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the UCIR model is 31.6% lower than that of the SIR model. Finally, by fixing the key parameters α, β, θ, ε, p, q in the UCIR model, and changing only one of them, we studied the effect of the transition probability between different states on the process of public opinion information transmission, and then proposed corresponding guidance. In addition, from the two perspectives of network media and government, the countermeasures and suggestions for the guidance of public opinion are proposed. We try to solve the problems of humanities and social sciences with the method of natural science. These research results can provide theoretical and methodological support for people to understand the law of public opinion information transmission and establish a guiding mechanism for public opinion information transmission.",2021,2021-08-17 00:00:00,5.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d79df326fbf63e24a42abc5c8defe4fbb718dbf

However, the network public opinion tends to generate strongly misleading and a large number of messages can cause shocks to the public once major emergencies appear. Therefore, we need to make correct prediction regarding and timely identify a potential crisis in the early warning of network public opinion. In view of this, this study fully considers the features of development and the propagation characteristics, so as to construct a network public opinion early warning index system that includes 4 first-level indicators and 13 second-level indicators. The weight of each indicator is calculated by the “CRITIC” method, so that the comprehensive evaluation value of each time point can be obtained and the early warning level of internet public opinion can be divided. Then, the Back Propagation neural network based on Genetic Algorithm (GA-BP) is used to establish a network public opinion early warning model. Finally, the major public health emergency, COVID-19 pandemic, is taken as a case for empirical analysis. The results show that by comparing with the traditional classification methods, such as BP neural network, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and naive Bayes, GA-BP neural network has a higher accuracy rate for early warning of network public opinion. Consequently, the index system and early warning model constructed in this study have good feasibility and can provide references for related research on internet public opinion.",2021,2021-03-17 00:00:00,19.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9f76539690fd601bf0ecda6f9b3c689bc6bf79f
10.1007/s00271-022-00788-w,Vine water status mapping with multispectral UAV imagery and machine learning,"Optimizing water management has become one of the biggest challenges for grapevine growers in California, especially during drought conditions. Monitoring grapevine water status and stress level across the whole vineyard is an essential step for precision irrigation management of vineyards to conserve water. We developed a unified machine learning model to map leaf water potential ( $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf ), by combining high-resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery and weather data. We conducted six unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights with a five-band multispectral camera from 2018 to 2020 over three commercial vineyards, concurrently with ground measurements of sampled vines. Using vegetation indices from the orthomosaiced UAV imagery and weather data as predictors, the random forest (RF) full model captured 77% of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf variance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 MPa, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.100 MPa, based on the validation datasets. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and red edge indices such as the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) were found as the most important variables in estimating $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf across space and time. The reduced RF models excluding weather and red edge indices explained 52–48% of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf variance, respectively. Maps of the estimated $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf from the RF full model captured well the patterns of both within- and cross-field spatial variability and the temporal change of vine water status, consistent with irrigation management and patterns observed from the ground sampling. Our results demonstrated the utility of UAV-based aerial multispectral imaging for supplementing and scaling up the traditional point-based ground sampling of $${\psi }_{\mathrm{leaf}}$$ ψ leaf . The pre-trained machine learning model, driven by UAV imagery and weather data, provides a cost-effective and scalable tool to facilitate data-driven precision irrigation management at individual vine levels in vineyards.",2022,2022-04-18 00:00:00,30.0,69.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d3cbab75e16ca1eed3adf2a2fa7180e8742afb3

Reflectance indices obtained by an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Spec 4 hyperspectral spectrometer from tomato growth in two soil texture types exposed to four water stress levels (70–100% FC, 60–70% FC, 50–60% FC, and 40–50% FC) was deployed to schedule irrigation and management of crops’ water stress. The treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in a 2 × 4 factorial experiment. Water stress treatments were monitored with Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) every 12 h before and after irrigation to maintain soil water content at the desired (FC%). Soil electrical conductivity (Ec) was measured daily throughout the growth cycle of tomatoes in both soil types. Ec was revealing a strong correlation with water stress at R2 above 0.95 p < 0.001. Yield was measured at the end of the end of the growing season. The results revealed that yield had a high correlation with water stress at R2 = 0.9758 and 0.9816 p < 0.01 for sandy loam and silty loam soils, respectively. Leaf temperature (LT °C), relative leaf water content (RLWC), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), Leaf area index (LAI), were measured at each growth stage at the same time spectral reflectance data were measured throughout the growth period. Spectral reflectance indices used were grouped into three: (1) greenness vegetative indices; (2) water overtone vegetation indices; (3) Photochemical Reflectance Index centered at 570 nm (PRI570), and normalized PRI (PRInorm). These reflectance indices were strongly correlated with all four water stress indicators and yield. The results revealed that NDVI, RDVI, WI, NDWI, NDWI1640, PRI570, and PRInorm were the most sensitive indices for estimating crop water stress at each growth stage in both sandy loam and silty loam soils at R2 above 0.35.

10.3390/rs13010147,Applying RGB- and Thermal-Based Vegetation Indices from UAVs for High-Throughput Field Phenotyping of Drought Tolerance in Forage Grasses,"The persistence and productivity of forage grasses, important sources for feed production, are threatened by climate change-induced drought. Breeding programs are in search of new drought tolerant forage grass varieties, but those programs still rely on time-consuming and less consistent visual scoring by breeders. In this study, we evaluate whether Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing can complement or replace this visual breeder score. A field experiment was set up to test the drought tolerance of genotypes from three common forage types of two different species: Festuca arundinacea, diploid Lolium perenne and tetraploid Lolium perenne. Drought stress was imposed by using mobile rainout shelters. UAV flights with RGB and thermal sensors were conducted at five time points during the experiment. Visual-based indices from different colour spaces were selected that were closely correlated to the breeder score. Furthermore, several indices, in particular H and NDLab, from the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and CIELab (Commission Internationale de l’éclairage) colour space, respectively, displayed a broad-sense heritability that was as high or higher than the visual breeder score, making these indices highly suited for high-throughput field phenotyping applications that can complement or even replace the breeder score. The thermal-based Crop Water Stress Index CWSI provided complementary information to visual-based indices, enabling the analysis of differences in ecophysiological mechanisms for coping with reduced water availability between species and ploidy levels. All species/types displayed variation in drought stress tolerance, which confirms that there is sufficient variation for selection within these groups of grasses. Our results confirmed the better drought tolerance potential of Festuca arundinacea, but also showed which Lolium perenne genotypes are more tolerant.",2021,2021-01-05 00:00:00,44.0,102.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c3785e2ac666d01a8cc3ddb9900f2ec11e1936c

Utilizing the rule of deep learning (DL), we introduce and fine-tune two robust frameworks, ResNet 50 and Inception V3, specifically designed for the classification of brain MRI images. Building upon the previous success of ResNet 50 and Inception V3 in classifying other medical imaging datasets, our investigation encompasses datasets with distinct characteristics, including one with four classes and another with two. The primary contribution of our research lies in the meticulous curation of these paired datasets. We have also integrated essential techniques, including Early Stopping and ReduceLROnPlateau, to refine the model through hyperparameter optimization. This involved adding extra layers, experimenting with various loss functions and learning rates, and incorporating dropout layers and regularization to ensure model convergence in predictions. Furthermore, strategic enhancements, such as customized pooling and regularization layers, have significantly elevated the accuracy of our models, resulting in remarkable classification accuracy. Notably, the pairing of ResNet 50 with the Nadam optimizer yields extraordinary accuracy rates, reaching 99.34% for gliomas, 93.52% for meningiomas, 98.68% for non-tumorous images, and 97.70% for pituitary tumors.

Big data is a crucial aspect of modern computing, and the choice of processing framework can significantly impact performance and efficiency. The technical revolution of big data has changed how organizations handle and value large databases. As data quantities expand quickly, effective and scalable data processing systems are essential. MapReduce and Apache Spark are two of the most popular large data processing techniques. This study compares these two frameworks to determine their merits, shortcomings, and applicability for big data applications. Nearly quintillion bytes of data are created daily. Approximately 90% of data was produced in the previous two years. At this stage, data comes from temperature sensors, social media, movies, photographs, transaction records (like banking records), mobile phone conversations, GPS signals, etc. In this article, all key big data technologies are introduced. This document compares all big data technologies and discusses their merits and downsides. Run trials using multiple data sets of varying sizes to validate and explain the study. Graphical depiction shows how one tool outperforms others for given data. Big Data is data generated by the rapid usage of the internet, sensors, and heavy machinery, with great volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Numbers, photos, videos, and text are omnipresent in every sector. Due to the pace and amount of data generation, the computing system struggles to manage large data. Data is stored in a distributed architectural file system due to its size and complexity. Big distributed file systems, which must be fault-tolerant, adaptable, and scalable, make complicated data analysis dangerous and time-consuming. Big data collection is called ‘datafication’.

10.5120/ijca2023923168,Progression and Challenges of IoT in Healthcare: A Short Review,"Smart healthcare, an integral element of connected living, plays a pivotal role in fulfilling a fundamental human need. The burgeoning field of smart healthcare is poised to generate substantial revenue in the foreseeable future. Its multifaceted framework encompasses vital components such as the Internet of Things (IoT), medical sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), edge and cloud computing, as well as next-generation wireless communication technologies. Many research papers discuss smart healthcare and healthcare more broadly. Numerous nations have strategically deployed the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) alongside other measures to combat the propagation of COVID-19. This combined effort has not only enhanced the safety of frontline healthcare workers but has also augmented the overall efficacy in managing the pandemic, subsequently reducing its impact on human lives and mortality rates. Remarkable strides have been made in both applications and technology within the IoMT domain. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that this technological advancement has introduced certain challenges, particularly in the realm of security. The rapid and extensive adoption of IoMT worldwide has magnified issues related to security and privacy. These encompass a spectrum of concerns, ranging from replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation, privileged insider threats, remote hijacking, password guessing, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, to malware incursions. In this comprehensive review, we undertake a comparative analysis of existing strategies designed for the detection and prevention of malware in IoT environments.",2023,2023-10-25 00:00:00,17.0,73.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/499f6485de92adb9857c951847de3d3b71bea480

10.3390/electronics8111257,Innovative Use of Wrist-Worn Wearable Devices in the Sports Domain: A Systematic Review,"Wrist wearables are becoming more and more popular, and its use is widespread in sports, both professional and amateur. However, at present, they do not seem to exploit all their potential. The objective of this study is to explore innovative proposals for the use of wearable wrist technology in the field of sports, to understand its potential and identify new challenges and lines of future research related to this technology. A systematic review of the scientific literature, collected in 4 major repositories, was carried out to locate research initiatives where wrist wearables were introduced to address some sports-related challenges. Those works that were limited to evaluating sensor performance in sports activities and those in which wrist wearable devices did not play a significant role were excluded. 26 articles were eventually selected for full-text analysis that discuss the introduction of wrist-worn wearables to address some innovative use in the sports field. This study showcases relevant proposals in 10 different sports. The research initiatives identified are oriented to the use of wearable wrist technology (i) for the comprehensive monitoring of sportspeople’s behavior in activities not supported by the vendors, (ii) to identify specific types of movements or actions in specific sports, and (iii) to prevent injuries. There are, however, open issues that should be tackled in the future, such as the incorporation of these devices in sports activities not currently addressed, or the provision of specific recommendation services for sport practitioners.",2019,2019-11-01 00:00:00,32.0,79.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ca52c762898a345c14c02fe262b48cb6f3abb6a

10.3390/jcm12072667,MYD88-Mutated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma as a Distinctive Molecular Subgroup Is Associated with Atypical Immunophenotypes in Chinese Patients,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is a heterogeneous disease in Western and Chinese populations, and it is still not well characterized in Chinese patients. Based on a large cohort of newly diagnosed CLL/SLL patients from China, we investigated immunophenotypes, genetic abnormalities, and their correlations. Eighty-four percent of the CLL/SLL patients showed typical immunophenotypes with scores of 4 or 5 points in the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) scoring system (classic group), and the remaining 16% of patients were atypical with scores lower than 4 points (atypical group). Trisomy 12 and variants of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, ATM, and MYD88 were the most recurrent genetic aberrations. Additionally, unsupervised genomic analysis based on molecular genetics revealed distinctive characteristics of MYD88 variants in CLL/SLL. By overlapping different correlation grouping analysis from genetics to immunophenotypes, the results showed MYD88 variants to be highly related to atypical CLL/SLL immunophenotypes. Furthermore, compared with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the genetic landscape showed potential value in clinical differential diagnosis of atypical CLL/SLL and MCL patients. These results reveal immunophenotypic and genetic features, and may provide insights into the tumorigenesis and clinical management of Chinese CLL/SLL patients.",2023,2023-04-01 00:00:00,2.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e45c9012f7d222231cbb1018e7bf317ca4c3640
10.1186/s12885-022-10070-z,EZH2 mutations at diagnosis in follicular lymphoma: a promising biomarker to guide frontline treatment,"EZH2 is mutated in nearly 25% of follicular lymphoma (FL) cases. Little is known about how EZH2 affects patients’ response to therapy. In this context, the aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the frequency of mutations in EZH2 at diagnosis in tissue and ctDNA in patients with FL and to assess the patients’ outcomes after receiving immunochemotherapy, depending on the EZH2 mutation status. Among the 154 patients included in the study, 27% had mutated EZH2 (46% with high-grade and 26% with low-grade FL). Of the mutated tissue samples, the mutation in ctDNA was identified in 44% of cases. EZH2 mutation in ctDNA was not identified in any patient unmutated in the tissue. Unmutated patients who received R-CHOP had significantly more relapses than patients who received R-Bendamustine (16/49 vs. 2/23, p  = 0.040). Furthermore, our results show that patients with mutated EZH2 treated with R-CHOP vs. those treated with R-Bendamustine present a lower incidence of relapse (10% vs. 42% p  = 0.09 at 4 years), a higher PFS (92% vs. 40% p  = 0.039 at 4 years), and higher OS (100% vs. 78% p  = 0.039 at 4 years). Based on these data, RCHOP could be a more suitable regimen for mutated patients, and R-bendamustine for unmutated patients. These findings could mean the first-time identification of a useful biomarker to guide upfront therapy in FL.",2022,2022-09-14 00:00:00,12.0,49.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed1bb935af00564dd0d081858d1563a47385e499

Their use guides the identification of pathogenic variants amidst the sea of benign variation present in every human genome, and supports the discovery of new disease–gene relationships. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is currently the largest and most widely used publicly available collection of population variation from harmonized sequencing data. The data is available through the online gnomAD browser (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) that enables rapid and intuitive variant analysis. This review provides guidance on the content of the gnomAD browser, and its usage for variant and gene interpretation.

10.3390/cancers13061340,Detection of Rare Germline Variants in the Genomes of Patients with B-Cell Neoplasms,"Simple Summary The global importance of rare variants in tumorigenesis has been addressed by some pan-cancer analysis, revealing significant enrichments in protein-truncating variants affecting genes such as ATM, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, and MSH6. Germline variants can influence treatment response and contribute to the development of treatment-related second neoplasms, especially in childhood leukemia. We aimed to analyze the genomes of patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders for the discovery of genes enriched in rare pathogenic variants. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in germline rare and dysfunctional variants. Additionally, we detected rare and likely pathogenic variants associated with disease prognosis and potential druggability, indicating a relevant role of these events in the variability of cancer phenotypes. Abstract There is growing evidence indicating the implication of germline variation in cancer predisposition and prognostication. Here, we describe an analysis of likely disruptive rare variants across the genomes of 726 patients with B-cell lymphoid neoplasms. We discovered a significant enrichment for two genes in rare dysfunctional variants, both of which participate in the regulation of oxidative stress pathways (CHMP6 and GSTA4). Additionally, we detected 1675 likely disrupting variants in genes associated with cancer, of which 44.75% were novel events and 7.88% were protein-truncating variants. Among these, the most frequently affected genes were ATM, BIRC6, CLTCL1A, and TSC2. Homozygous or germline double-hit variants were detected in 28 cases, and coexisting somatic events were observed in 17 patients, some of which affected key lymphoma drivers such as ATM, KMT2D, and MYC. Finally, we observed that variants in six different genes were independently associated with shorter survival in CLL. Our study results support an important role for rare germline variation in the pathogenesis and prognosis of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms.",2021,2021-03-01 00:00:00,13.0,88.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5596d9bec3324f591f529dd8037417c823fcb892

Most patients with iNHL have an excellent prognosis, and in many, treatment can be deferred for years. However, some patients will have an accelerated course and may experience transformation into aggressive lymphomas. In this review, we focus on management concepts shared across iNHLs, as well as histology-specific strategies. We address open questions in the field, including the influence of genomics and molecular pathway alterations on treatment decisions. In addition, we review the management of uncommon clinical entities including nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, splenic lymphoma and primary lymphoma of extranodal sites.

10.1038/s41408-020-00404-0,Gene expression profiling-based risk prediction and profiles of immune infiltration in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"The clinical risk stratification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) relies on the International Prognostic Index (IPI) for the identification of high-risk disease. Recent studies suggest that the immune microenvironment plays a role in treatment response prediction and survival in DLBCL. This study developed a risk prediction model and evaluated the model’s biological implications in association with the estimated profiles of immune infiltration. Gene-expression profiling of 718 patients with DLBCL was done, for which RNA sequencing data and clinical covariates were obtained from Reddy et al. (2017). Using unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to identify survival-associated gene signatures, a multivariable model of survival was constructed. Tumor-infiltrating immune cell compositions were enumerated using CIBERSORT deconvolution analysis. A four gene-signature-based score was developed that separated patients into high- and low-risk groups. The combination of the gene-expression-based score with the IPI improved the discrimination on the validation and complete sets. The gene signatures were successfully validated with the deconvolution output. Correlating the deconvolution findings with the gene signatures and risk score, CD8+ T-cells and naïve CD4+ T-cells were associated with favorable prognosis. By analyzing the gene-expression data with a systematic approach, a risk prediction model that outperforms the existing risk assessment methods was developed and validated.",2021,2021-01-01 00:00:00,28.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4267b8aeeff530ed263b50b2a9ddaccfae371ffb

Methods A total of 1270 COVID-19 patients, including 984 admitted in Sino French New City Branch (training and internal validation sets randomly split at 7:3 ratio) and 286 admitted in Optical Valley Branch (external validation set) of Wuhan Tongji hospital, were included in this study. Forty-eight clinical and laboratory features were screened with LASSO method. Further multi-tree extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning-based model was used to rank importance of features selected from LASSO and subsequently constructed death risk prediction model with simple-tree XGBoost model. Performances of models were evaluated by AUC, prediction accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Results Six features, including disease severity, age, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were selected as predictors for COVID-19 mortality. Simple-tree XGBoost model conducted by these features can predict death risk accurately with >90% precision and >85% sensitivity, as well as F1 scores >0.90 in training and validation sets. Conclusion We proposed the disease severity, age, serum levels of hs-CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-10 as significant predictors for death risk of COVID-19, which may help to identify the high-risk COVID-19 cases.

10.2196/17125,A Deep Artificial Neural Network−Based Model for Prediction of Underlying Cause of Death From Death Certificates: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Background Coding of underlying causes of death from death certificates is a process that is nowadays undertaken mostly by humans with potential assistance from expert systems, such as the Iris software. It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the CépiDc (Centre d’épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de Décès) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner. Objective This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death. Methods The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject’s age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject’s underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network−based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach’s superiority was assessed via bootstrap. Results The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010. Conclusions This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.",2020,2020-04-01 00:00:00,18.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07a5a4418c0b84a88c2a03487affcccc4bf245e7

This work studies a mathematical problem motivated by the bi‐objective optimization of data‐parallel applications on such platforms for performance and energy. First, we formulate the problem and present an exact algorithm of polynomial complexity solving the problem where all the application profiles of objective type one are continuous and strictly increasing, and all the application profiles of objective type two are linear increasing. We then apply the algorithm to develop solutions for two related optimization problems of parallel applications on heterogeneous hybrid platforms, one for performance and dynamic energy and the other for performance and total energy. Our proposed solution methods are then employed to solve the two bi‐objective optimization problems for two data‐parallel applications, matrix multiplication and gene sequencing, on a hybrid platform employing five heterogeneous processors, namely, two different Intel multicore CPUs, an Nvidia K40c GPU, an Nvidia P100 PCIe GPU, and an Intel Xeon Phi.",2022,2022-09-02 00:00:00,4.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2522a6ded924ff150e5aa90c340c5622f724ecd3

10.59324/ejtas.2023.1(6).110,Diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithm,"A large percentage of people globally suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD), a serious health concern. Effective diagnosis, treatment, and referral of CKD depend heavily on early identification and prediction of the disease. However, it is difficult to evaluate and derive significant insights from health data due to its vast and complicated nature. Engineers and medical researchers are using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to create predictive models for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an effort to address this issue. The goal of this research is to create and validate predictive models for chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on a variety of clinical factors, including albuminuria, age, diet, eGFR, and pre-existing medical problems. The objective is to estimate the likelihood of renal failure, which may necessitate kidney dialysis or a transplant, and to evaluate the degree of kidney disease. With the use of this knowledge, patients and healthcare providers should be able to make well-informed decisions about diagnosis, treatment, and lifestyle changes. Patterns in the gathered data can be found, and future incidence of CKD or other related diseases can be predicted, by utilising MLT such as ANN and data mining techniques. Finding novel characteristics linked to the onset of renal disease and adding more trustworthy data from CKD patients. The best algorithm to categorise the data as CKD or NOT_CKD is chosen throughout the design process, and the data is then classified according to this differentiation. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which offers important details about the patient's current kidney function, is used to classify cases of chronic kidney disease. By combining complete patient data with machine learning algorithms, this research advances the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and improves patient outcomes.",2023,2023-11-01 00:00:00,19.0,14.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05138e7b40a9eb0f859070a4da243337ebd66559

The proposed system first uses the separability filter proposed by Fukui and Yamaguchi (Trans. IEICE Japan J80-D-II. 8, 2170-2177, 1997) to obtain the best object candidates and next, the system uses the Circular Hough Transform (CHT) to detect the presence of circular shape. The main contribution of this work consists of using together two different techniques in order to take advantages from the peculiarity of each of them. As the results of the experiments, the object detection rate of the proposed system was 96% for 25 images by moving the circle template every 20 pixels to right and down.",2005,2005-12-31 00:00:00,158.0,8.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf6339d527e5d70d882885a7ab96414ca074641a

It has no cure and the symptoms vary widely, depending on the affected regions, amount of damage, and the ability to activate compensatory mechanisms, which constitutes a challenge to evaluate and predict its course. Additionally, relapsing-remitting patients can evolve its course into a secondary progressive, characterized by a slow progression of disability independent of relapses. With clinical information from Multiple Sclerosis patients, we developed a machine learning exploration framework concerning this disease evolution, more specifically to obtain three predictions: one on conversion to secondary progressive course and two on disease severity with rapid accumulation of disability, concerning the 6th and 10th years of progression.

An EDSS measurement contains an overall ‘EDSS’ score and several functional subscores. Typically, expert knowledge is required to interpret consult notes and generate these scores. Previous approaches used limited context length Word2Vec embeddings and keyword searches to predict scores given a consult note, but often failed when scores were not explicitly stated. In this work, we present MS-BERT, the first publicly available transformer model trained on real clinical data other than MIMIC. Next, we present MSBC, a classifier that applies MS-BERT to generate embeddings and predict EDSS and functional subscores. Lastly, we explore combining MSBC with other models through the use of Snorkel to generate scores for unlabelled consult notes. MSBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on all metrics and prediction tasks and outperforms the models generated from the Snorkel ensemble.

The main objectives of this study were to use a feature engineering approach to incorporate clinical expert knowledge prior to applying machine learning techniques, and to assess the impact of the approach on model complexity and performance. Four machine learning models were trained to predict mortality with a severe asthma case study. Experiments to select fewer input features based on a discriminative score showed low to moderate precision for discovering clinically meaningful triplets, indicating that discriminative score alone cannot replace clinical input. When compared to baseline machine learning models, we found a decrease in model complexity with use of fewer features informed by discriminative score and filtering of laboratory features with clinical input. We also found a small difference in performance for the mortality prediction task when comparing baseline ML models to models that used filtered features. Encoding demographic and triplet information in ML models with filtered features appeared to show performance improvements from the baseline. These findings indicated that the use of filtered features may reduce model complexity, and with little impact on performance.",2020,2020-04-23 00:00:00,28.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8d163033b58317b58a3fd2389e1ac2209be1f40

10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul1500,Research on the Impact of Geopolitical Instability on Russian Trade,"This study examines how global and country- specific geopolitical instability affects Russian trade using data from 1996 to 2021. A panel regression model analyzes trade between Russia and its 15 top trading partners, exploring both direct and indirect effects. The analysis focuses on how accumulated foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange rate fluctuations mediate these relationships. The findings reveal that global geopolitical instability decrease Russian trade by 0.0558. Interestingly, this negative impact is partially mediated by a decrease in FDI (-0.0805). This aligns with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, which show a significant negative effect of global geopolitical instability on FDI (-1.209). This suggests that FDI acts as a key transmitter of the negative effects of global instability on Russian trade. The role of exchange rate fluctuations, however, is more complex. While the Sobel Test indicated a negative indirect effect, the SEM analysis shows a positive indirect effect through exchange rate fluctuations on trade. This suggests potentially countervailing effects of currency fluctuations, with depreciation potentially incentivizing exports while appreciation might make imports cheaper. The impact of country-specific geopolitical instability varies depending on the context. Industries like food products and textiles are significantly affected by geopolitical instability increase, while sectors such as fuels, metals and raw materials show resilience. Close trading partners are less affected by global instability but suffer from partner- specific instability. Geographically, Western Europe benefits from global instability but faces challenges from partner-specific instability, contrasting with Eastern Europe and Asia. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how geopolitical instability, mediated by FDI and exchange rates, shapes Russia's trade performance.",2024,2024-08-03 00:00:00,929.0,17.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9b0bcfe881b6c90f76dfe7a913b0e022682ceb5

A detailed case study of deviations, out-of-Specification and CAPA generation is beneficial for improving pharmaceutical capabilities and understanding the documentation associated with a quality management system. It is essential for understanding deviations and out-of-spec in the pharmaceutical industry. The quality of medicines means that they meet the required specifications. The quality management system in the pharmaceutical industry is essential because the drugs or pharmaceutical products are delivered directly to the customer's body. Therefore, identity, purity, safety, and the quality of the products are critical. A Deviation can define as ""a deviation from an approved instruction or established standard"" The deviation process helps identify potential risks to product quality and patient safety and establish the root cause.

In this age of Industry 4.0 the fruit sorting is an important part in the food processing wherein this work plays a vital role. In this study, a solution for the detection and classification of apple fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. Deep learning models offer promise for automating disease identification using fruit images, but encounter obstacles such as therequirement for extensive training data, computational complexity, and the risk of overfitting. This study introduces an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture aimed at addressing these challenges by incorporating a reduced number of layers, thus alleviating computational burdens while maintaining performance. Additionally, augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are employed to diversify the training set without additional image acquisition. Our CNN model is specifically trained to identify common apple crop diseases like Scab, Rot, and Blotch. Rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness ofour model, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 95.37%. Significantly, our model demonstrates reduced storage requirements and faster execution times compared to existing deep CNN architectures, enabling deployment on handheld devices and resource-limited environments.

When they are introduced, they could have a variety of different negative effects, either as minor inconveniences or a severe problem. The aim of this review is to compile a list of invasive plant species across Asia and organize a set of data according to their reproduction rates, growth rates, dispersal rates, and characterize the allelochemicals they produce and allelopathic effects they have on their environment. The target is to know the extent of their spread ability in the area that they inhibit and know what control measures can be done with that specific species. The data has been gathered by compiling research articles and obtaining pertinent data relating to the objective. This review also utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to confirm the credibility of the collected references. To achieve the needed references, keywords such as ""distribution"", ""invasive"", and ""Asia"" have been used to search for these on search engines and research journals such as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, and Directory for Open Access Journals, to be then compiled in spreadsheets and document files. The results show that the growth rate of these species varies from 7.5-60 cm per year, where Ipomoea eberhardtii has the highest growth rate of 60 cm per year. The dispersal rates of the species ranges from 0.002-2592 km from the parent plant, where animal mediated, water, and wind dispersal methods are the primary vector to spread. Allelopathic effects produced by the allelochemicals present mostly inhibit growth and seed germination.

Viable computational methods that can facilitate tailored intervention while tolerating sequencing biases are in high demand. Here we propose a class of transparent and interpretable computational methods called integral genomic signature (iGenSig) analyses, that address the challenges of cross-dataset modeling through leveraging information redundancies within high-dimensional genomic features, averaging feature weights to prevent overweighing, and extracting unbiased genomic information from large tumor cohorts. Using genomic dataset of chemical perturbations, we develop a battery of iGenSig models for predicting cancer drug responses, and validate the models using independent cell-line and clinical datasets. The iGenSig models for five drugs demonstrate predictive values in six clinical studies, among which the Erlotinib and 5-FU models significantly predict therapeutic responses in three studies, offering clinically relevant insights into their inverse predictive signature pathways. Together, iGenSig provides a computational framework to facilitate tailored cancer therapy based on multi-omics data.

Mechanistically, this involves signal-processing through a complex network of molecular interactions that govern transcription factor activity patterns. Computer simulations of the information flow through this network could help predict cellular responses in health and disease. Here we develop a recurrent neural network framework constrained by prior knowledge of the signaling network with ligand-concentrations as input and transcription factor-activity as output. Applied to synthetic data, it predicts unseen test-data (Pearson correlation r = 0.98) and the effects of gene knockouts (r = 0.8). We stimulate macrophages with 59 different ligands, with and without the addition of lipopolysaccharide, and collect transcriptomics data. The framework predicts this data under cross-validation (r = 0.8) and knockout simulations suggest a role for RIPK1 in modulating the lipopolysaccharide response.

Particularly, transcriptome context, especially tumor microenvironment, has been shown playing a significant role in shaping the actual treatment outcome. In this study, we develop a deep variational autoencoder (VAE) model to compress thousands of genes into latent vectors in a low-dimensional space. We then demonstrate that these encoded vectors could accurately impute drug response, outperform standard signature-gene based approaches, and appropriately control the overfitting problem. We apply rigorous quality assessment and validation, including assessing the impact of cell line lineage, cross-validation, cross-panel evaluation, and application in independent clinical data sets, to warrant the accuracy of the imputed drug response in both cell lines and cancer samples. Specifically, the expression-regulated component (EReX) of the observed drug response achieves high correlation across panels. Using the well-trained models, we impute drug response of The Cancer Genome Atlas data and investigate the features and signatures associated with the imputed drug response, including cell line origins, somatic mutations and tumor mutation burdens, tumor microenvironment, and confounding factors.

In this paper, a method based on natural language processing (NLP) was adopted to analyze and classify this information. First, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was used to extract the semantic features of the text, which were then expressed in the corresponding topic feature space. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to construct a signal equipment fault diagnostic model that reduced the impact of sample data imbalance on the classification accuracy. This was compared and analyzed with the traditional Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms. This study used signal equipment failure text data from the Lan-Xin high-speed railway to conduct experimental analysis and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments showed that the accuracy of the SVM classification algorithm could reach 0.84 after being combined with the LDA topic model, which verifies that the natural language processing method can effectively realize the fault diagnosis of signal equipment and has certain guiding significance for the maintenance of field signal equipment.",2021,2021-07-28 00:00:00,11.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f254a8ed8c1f3f31d3641db53e21e0e23d670bd
10.1038/s41598-021-92559-4,"Accurate classification of fresh and charred grape seeds to the varietal level, using machine learning based classification method","Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) currently includes thousands of cultivars. Discrimination between these varieties, historically done by ampelography, is done in recent decades mostly by genetic analysis. However, when aiming to identify archaeobotanical remains, which are mostly charred with extremely low genomic preservation, the application of the genomic approach is rarely successful. As a result, variety-level identification of most grape remains is currently prevented. Because grape pips are highly polymorphic, several attempts were made to utilize their morphological diversity as a classification tool, mostly using 2D image analysis technics. Here, we present a highly accurate varietal classification tool using an innovative and accessible 3D seed scanning approach. The suggested classification methodology is machine-learning-based, applied with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique. This methodology achieved classification results of 91% to 93% accuracy in average when trained by fresh or charred seeds to test fresh or charred seeds, respectively. We show that when classifying 8 groups, enhanced accuracy levels can be achieved using a ""tournament"" approach. Future development of this new methodology can lead to an effective seed classification tool, significantly improving the fields of archaeobotany, as well as general taxonomy.",2021,2021-06-30 00:00:00,15.0,59.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/458c5cdbe95cd28231e62e3da2acd7c5c9c157fd

10.3390/SU13084214,Sustainable Sports Tourism Performance Assessment Using Grey-Based Hybrid Model,"The development of sports tourism is gaining momentum around the world, with many tourism industries combining sports events and programs to attract more domestic and overseas customers to promote economic and culture. Sustainability awareness has been gaining attention from many international organizations, resulting in the rise of sports tourism that incorporates sustainability. Therefore, the development of a valid and applicable sustainable sports tourism (SST) assessment model is an important task. In this study, a hybrid Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) model is proposed to measure the development performance of SST. The aims of this study include developing a SST assessment framework, identifying the mutual influential relationships among attributes, generating attribute influence weights, and calculating the performance of the evaluated items. The proposed model is divided into three stages. First, a cause-and-effect diagram is generated using the Grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (GDEMATEL) to describe the interactions and feedback among the attributes. Then, the GDEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (GDANP) is applied to generate the influence weights of the attributes and their rankings. Finally, the expanded Probability-based Grey Relational Analysis (expanded PGRA) was applied to calculate the performance of the evaluated items and to determine the gap between evaluated items and the aspiration level. This study improves the original PGRA technique by introducing the concept of aspiration level into the PGRA calculation process, thereby replacing the traditional concept of “relative satisfaction” with “aspiration level”. In addition, the expanded PGRA can assess a single rated item without being limited to at least two items. We used the Sun Moon Lake Scenic Area in Taiwan as a model demonstration. The results show that the top three attributes that need to be strengthened are disease prevention and treatment, local social welfare and protection, and sports diversity. In the Sun Moon Lake, intersection control should be set up to ensure the health status of visitors and local residents. In addition to epidemic prevention, more measures and behaviors should be developed to deal with tourism diseases. We suggested that subsidies be provided to local residents to rebuild the fences around their homes to avoid disturbances caused by the influx of tourists. Moreover, the local government can create more sports events with special characteristics that can attract tourists to come again and again.",2021,2021-04-10 00:00:00,15.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d5353d433e4b0e03d106ff73072c24a96b61709
10.1007/s12149-024-01923-7,The effect of harmonization on the variability of PET radiomic features extracted using various segmentation methods,"Purpose This study aimed to examine the robustness of positron emission tomography (PET) radiomic features extracted via different segmentation methods before and after ComBat harmonization in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods We included 120 patients (positive recurrence = 46 and negative recurrence = 74) referred for PET scanning as a routine part of their care. All patients had a biopsy-proven NSCLC. Nine segmentation methods were applied to each image, including manual delineation, K-means (KM), watershed, fuzzy-C-mean, region-growing, local active contour (LAC), and iterative thresholding (IT) with 40, 45, and 50% thresholds. Diverse image discretizations, both without a filter and with different wavelet decompositions, were applied to PET images. Overall, 6741 radiomic features were extracted from each image (749 radiomic features from each segmented area). Non-parametric empirical Bayes (NPEB) ComBat harmonization was used to harmonize the features. Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) with L1 regularization For feature selection and Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) with fivefold nested cross-validation was performed using StratifiedKFold with ‘n_splits’ set to 5 to predict recurrence in NSCLC patients and assess the impact of ComBat harmonization on the outcome. Results From 749 extracted radiomic features, 206 (27%) and 389 (51%) features showed excellent reliability (ICC ≥ 0.90) against segmentation method variation before and after NPEB ComBat harmonization, respectively. Among all, 39 features demonstrated poor reliability, which declined to 10 after ComBat harmonization. The 64 fixed bin widths (without any filter) and wavelets (LLL)-based radiomic features set achieved the best performance in terms of robustness against diverse segmentation techniques before and after ComBat harmonization. The first-order and GLRLM and also first-order and NGTDM feature families showed the largest number of robust features before and after ComBat harmonization, respectively. In terms of predicting recurrence in NSCLC, our findings indicate that using ComBat harmonization can significantly enhance machine learning outcomes, particularly improving the accuracy of watershed segmentation, which initially had fewer reliable features than manual contouring. Following the application of ComBat harmonization, the majority of cases saw substantial increase in sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion Radiomic features are vulnerable to different segmentation methods. ComBat harmonization might be considered a solution to overcome the poor reliability of radiomic features.

10.1007/s11517-024-03071-6,"Impact of harmonization on the reproducibility of MRI radiomic features when using different scanners, acquisition parameters, and image pre-processing techniques: a phantom study","This study investigated the impact of ComBat harmonization on the reproducibility of radiomic features extracted from magnetic resonance images (MRI) acquired on different scanners, using various data acquisition parameters and multiple image pre-processing techniques using a dedicated MRI phantom. Four scanners were used to acquire an MRI of a nonanatomic phantom as part of the TCIA RIDER database. In fast spin-echo inversion recovery (IR) sequences, several inversion durations were employed, including 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 ms. In addition, a 3D fast spoiled gradient recalled echo (FSPGR) sequence was used to investigate several flip angles (FA): 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees. Nineteen phantom compartments were manually segmented. Different approaches were used to pre-process each image: Bin discretization, Wavelet filter, Laplacian of Gaussian, logarithm, square, square root, and gradient. Overall, 92 first-, second-, and higher-order statistical radiomic features were extracted. ComBat harmonization was also applied to the extracted radiomic features. Finally, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Kruskal-Wallis’s (KW) tests were implemented to assess the robustness of radiomic features. The number of non-significant features in the KW test ranged between 0–5 and 29–74 for various scanners, 31–91 and 37–92 for three times tests, 0–33 to 34–90 for FAs, and 3–68 to 65–89 for IRs before and after ComBat harmonization, with different image pre-processing techniques, respectively. The number of features with ICC over 90% ranged between 0–8 and 6–60 for various scanners, 11–75 and 17–80 for three times tests, 3–83 to 9–84 for FAs, and 3–49 to 3–63 for IRs before and after ComBat harmonization, with different image pre-processing techniques, respectively. The use of various scanners, IRs, and FAs has a great impact on radiomic features. However, the majority of scanner-robust features is also robust to IR and FA. Among the effective parameters in MR images, several tests in one scanner have a negligible impact on radiomic features. Different scanners and acquisition parameters using various image pre-processing might affect radiomic features to a large extent. ComBat harmonization might significantly impact the reproducibility of MRI radiomic features.

10.3390/diagnostics13233580,Evaluation of the Reliability and the Performance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics in the Presence of Randomly Generated Irrelevant Features for Prostate Cancer,"Radiomics has the potential to aid prostate cancer (PC) diagnoses and prediction by analyzing and modeling quantitative features extracted from clinical imaging. However, its reliability has been a concern, possibly due to its high-dimensional nature. This study aims to quantitatively investigate the impact of randomly generated irrelevant features on MRI radiomics feature selection, modeling, and performance by progressively adding randomly generated features. Two multiparametric-MRI radiomics PC datasets were used (dataset 1 (n = 260), dataset 2 (n = 100)). The endpoint was to differentiate pathology-confirmed clinically significant (Gleason score (GS) ≥ 7) from insignificant (GS < 7) PC. Random features were generated at 12 levels with a 10% increment from 0% to 100% and an additional 5%. Three feature selection algorithms and two classifiers were used to build the models. The area under the curve and accuracy were used to evaluate the model’s performance. Feature importance was calculated to assess features’ contributions to the models. The metrics of each model were compared using an ANOVA test with a Bonferroni correction. A slight tendency to select more random features with the increasing number of random features introduced to the datasets was observed. However, the performance of the radiomics-built models was not significantly affected, which was partially due to the higher contribution of radiomics features toward the models compared to the random features. These reliability effects also vary among datasets. In conclusion, while the inclusion of additional random features may still slightly impact the performance of the feature selection, it may not have a substantial impact on the MRI radiomics model performance.",2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,3.0,28.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9bfebc54466ed28d73ba8b4f282d5cb4419f60b8

We aim to assess the potential of radiomic features in predicting the time-to-event OS of patients with GBM using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Materials and methods One hundred nineteen patients with GBM, who had T1-weighted contrast-enhanced and T2-FLAIR MRI sequences, along with clinical data and survival time, were enrolled. Image preprocessing methods included 64 bin discretization, Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filters with three Sigma values and eight variations of Wavelet Transform. Images were then segmented, followed by the extraction of 1212 radiomic features. Seven feature selection (FS) methods and six time-to-event ML algorithms were utilized. The combination of preprocessing, FS, and ML algorithms (12 × 7 × 6 = 504 models) was evaluated by multivariate analysis. Results Our multivariate analysis showed that the best prognostic FS/ML combinations are the Mutual Information (MI)/Cox Boost, MI/Generalized Linear Model Boosting (GLMB) and MI/Generalized Linear Model Network (GLMN), all of which were done via the LOG (Sigma = 1 mm) preprocessing method (C-index = 0.77). The LOG filter with Sigma = 1 mm preprocessing method, MI, GLMB and GLMN achieved significantly higher C-indices than other preprocessing, FS, and ML methods (all p values < 0.05, mean C-indices of 0.65, 0.70, and 0.64, respectively). Conclusion ML algorithms are capable of predicting the time-to-event OS of patients using MRI-based radiomic and clinical features. MRI-based radiomics analysis in combination with clinical variables might appear promising in assisting clinicians in the survival prediction of patients with GBM. Further research is needed to establish the applicability of radiomics in the management of GBM in the clinic.",2023,2023-09-26 00:00:00,19.0,62.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1de80c151bf1fe0b822950b3754ab7edd73947b7
10.3390/diagnostics13061167,Phenotyping the Histopathological Subtypes of Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma: How Beneficial Is Radiomics?,"The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of radiomics in the absence of well-defined standard guidelines. Specifically, we extracted radiomics features from multicenter computed tomography (CT) images to differentiate between the four histopathological subtypes of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In addition, the results that varied with the radiomics model were compared. We investigated the presence of the batch effects and the impact of feature harmonization on the models’ performance. Moreover, the question on how the training dataset composition influenced the selected feature subsets and, consequently, the model’s performance was also investigated. Therefore, through combining data from the two publicly available datasets, this study involves a total of 152 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 106 large cell carcinoma (LCC), 150 adenocarcinoma (ADC), and 58 no other specified (NOS). Through the matRadiomics tool, which is an example of Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) compliant software, 1781 radiomics features were extracted from each of the malignant lesions that were identified in CT images. After batch analysis and feature harmonization, which were based on the ComBat tool and were integrated in matRadiomics, the datasets (the harmonized and the non-harmonized) were given as an input to a machine learning modeling pipeline. The following steps were articulated: (i) training-set/test-set splitting (80/20); (ii) a Kruskal–Wallis analysis and LASSO linear regression for the feature selection; (iii) model training; (iv) a model validation and hyperparameter optimization; and (v) model testing. Model optimization consisted of a 5-fold cross-validated Bayesian optimization, repeated ten times (inner loop). The whole pipeline was repeated 10 times (outer loop) with six different machine learning classification algorithms. Moreover, the stability of the feature selection was evaluated. Results showed that the batch effects were present even if the voxels were resampled to an isotropic form and whether feature harmonization correctly removed them, even though the models’ performances decreased. Moreover, the results showed that a low accuracy (61.41%) was reached when differentiating between the four subtypes, even though a high average area under curve (AUC) was reached (0.831). Further, a NOS subtype was classified as almost completely correct (true positive rate ~90%). The accuracy increased (77.25%) when only the SCC and ADC subtypes were considered, as well as when a high AUC (0.821) was obtained—although harmonization decreased the accuracy to 58%. Moreover, the features that contributed the most to models’ performance were those extracted from wavelet decomposed and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filtered images and they belonged to the texture feature class.. In conclusion, we showed that our multicenter data were affected by batch effects, that they could significantly alter the models’ performance, and that feature harmonization correctly removed them. Although wavelet features seemed to be the most informative features, an absolute subset could not be identified since it changed depending on the training/testing splitting. Moreover, performance was influenced by the chosen dataset and by the machine learning methods, which could reach a high accuracy in binary classification tasks, but could underperform in multiclass problems. It is, therefore, essential that the scientific community propose a more systematic radiomics approach, focusing on multicenter studies, with clear and solid guidelines to facilitate the translation of radiomics to clinical practice.",2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,17.0,63.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12c499907379802ccf10bb8af7f06005b0bfb5b6

The images were resliced, resampled, and realigned. In the next step, tumors were segmented semi-automatically into subregions including whole tumor, edema region, core tumor, enhancing region, and necrotic region. A total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from each subregion. The data were divided randomly into training and testing sets. A deep learning-based data augmentation method (CTGAN) was implemented to synthesize 200 datasets. A total of 18 classifiers were used to distinguish two genotypes of grade 4 astrocytomas. The best discriminatory power was obtained from core tumor regions overlaid on post-contrast T1 using the K-best feature selection algorithm and a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier. Abstract This study aimed to investigate the potential of quantitative radiomic data extracted from conventional MR images in discriminating IDH-mutant grade 4 astrocytomas from IDH-wild-type glioblastomas (GBMs). A cohort of 57 treatment-naïve patients with IDH-mutant grade 4 astrocytomas (n = 23) and IDH-wild-type GBMs (n = 34) underwent anatomical imaging on a 3T MR system with standard parameters. Post-contrast T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images were co-registered. A semi-automatic segmentation approach was used to generate regions of interest (ROIs) from different tissue components of neoplasms. A total of 1050 radiomic features were extracted from each image. The data were split randomly into training and testing sets. A deep learning-based data augmentation method (CTGAN) was implemented to synthesize 200 datasets from the training sets. A total of 18 classifiers were used to distinguish two genotypes of grade 4 astrocytomas. From generated data using 80% training set, the best discriminatory power was obtained from core tumor regions overlaid on post-contrast T1 using the K-best feature selection algorithm and a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier (AUC = 0.93, accuracy = 0.92, sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.86, PR_AUC = 0.92). Similarly, high diagnostic performances were obtained from original and generated data using 50% and 30% training sets.

Given the recent advances in light microscopy and the need for accurate and high-throughput analysis of cells, automated algorithms have been developed for segmenting and analyzing the cells in microscopy images. Nevertheless, accurate, generic and robust whole-cell segmentation is still a persisting need to precisely quantify its morphological properties, phenotypes and sub-cellular dynamics. We present a single-channel whole cell segmentation algorithm. We use markers that stain the whole cell, but with less staining in the nucleus, and without using a separate nuclear stain. We show the utility of our approach in microscopy images of cell cultures in a wide variety of conditions.

Furthermore, we identified dynamic changes in tuft cell number, composition, and protein expression associated with fasting and refeeding and after introduction of microbiota to germ-free mice.

10.1073/pnas.1717236115,Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities in high-energy density settings on the National Ignition Facility,"Significance We present research results on the Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability at an unstable interface under high-energy density conditions using the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. We can reach pressures in the 100-TPa regime on the Hugoniot, or ∼500-GPa regime along a quasi-isentrope, allowing the sample under study to remain solid, at planetary interior pressures. We observe RT stabilization (i) at an ablation front; (ii) in the presence of a strongly radiative shock; and (iii) in a unique regime of quasi-isentropic, high pressure, solid-state material flow, where the material strength significantly affects the evolution of a hydrodynamically unstable interface. The Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability occurs at an interface between two fluids of differing density during an acceleration. These instabilities can occur in very diverse settings, from inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions over spatial scales of ∼10−3−10−1 cm (10–1,000 μm) to supernova explosions at spatial scales of ∼1012 cm and larger. We describe experiments and techniques for reducing (“stabilizing”) RT growth in high-energy density (HED) settings on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Three unique regimes of stabilization are described: (i) at an ablation front, (ii) behind a radiative shock, and (iii) due to material strength. For comparison, we also show results from nonstabilized “classical” RT instability evolution in HED regimes on the NIF. Examples from experiments on the NIF in each regime are given. These phenomena also occur in several astrophysical scenarios and planetary science [Drake R (2005) Plasma Phys Controlled Fusion 47:B419–B440; Dahl TW, Stevenson DJ (2010) Earth Planet Sci Lett 295:177–186].",2018,2018-06-26 00:00:00,98.0,70.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68b11ff52f1c9b2fd39f79bf1572b16969c372c4

10.1039/d2cp05083h,Bayesian chemical reaction neural network for autonomous kinetic uncertainty quantification.,"Chemical reaction neural network (CRNN), a recently developed tool for autonomous discovery of reaction models, has been successfully demonstrated on a variety of chemical engineering and biochemical systems. It leverages the extraordinary data-fitting capacity of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) while preserving high interpretability and robustness by embedding widely applicable physical laws such as the law of mass action and the Arrhenius law. In this paper, we further developed Bayesian CRNN to not only reconstruct but also quantify the uncertainty of chemical kinetic models from data. Two methods, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and variational inference, were used to perform the Bayesian CRNN, with the latter mainly adopted for its speed. We demonstrated the capability of Bayesian CRNN in the kinetic uncertainty quantification of different types of chemical systems and discussed the importance of embedding physical laws in data-driven modeling. Finally, we discussed the adaptation of Bayesian CRNN for incomplete measurements and model mixing for global uncertainty quantification.",2023,2023-01-20 00:00:00,17.0,7.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9613157f06612f3c5425eee124b52187050b04ac

In this work, surrogated model-based methods were developed to accurately predict the solubility of two molecules (solute and solvent) through machine learning and deep learning. The current study employed two methods: (1) converting molecules into molecular fingerprints and adding optimal physicochemical properties as descriptors and (2) using graph convolutional network (GCN) models to convert molecules into a graph representation and deal with prediction tasks. Then, two prediction tasks were conducted with each method: (1) the solubility value (regression) and (2) the solubility class (classification). The fingerprint-based method clearly demonstrates that high performance is possible by adding simple but significant physicochemical descriptors to molecular fingerprints, while the GCN method shows that it is possible to predict various properties of chemical compounds with relatively simplified features from the graph representation. The developed methodologies provide a comprehensive understanding of constructing a proper model for predicting solubility and can be employed to find suitable solutes and solvents.",2022,2022-04-04 00:00:00,40.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d530415ab96ed4ea4c5ba2348772b51097247bcc

Despite this, coffee remains vulnerable to several plant diseases that may result in significant financial losses for the agricultural industry. Traditionally, plant diseases are detected by expert observation with the naked eye. Traditional methods for managing such diseases are arduous, time-consuming, and costly, especially when dealing with expansive territories. Using a model based on transfer learning and deep learning model, we present in this study a technique for classifying Robusta coffee leaf disease photos into healthy and unhealthy classes. The MobileNetV2 network serves as the model since its network design is simple. Therefore, it is likely that the suggested approach will be deployed further on mobile devices. In addition, the transfer learning and experimental learning paradigms. Because it is such a lightweight net, the MobileNetV2 system serves as the foundational model. Results on Robusta coffee leaf disease datasets indicate that the suggested technique can achieve a high level of accuracy, up to 99.93%. The accuracy of other architectures besides MobileNetV2 such as DenseNet169 is 99.74%, ResNet50 architecture is 99.41%, and InceptionResNetV2 architecture is 99.09%.",2022,2022-12-01 00:00:00,13.0,24.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c94edba52bcece4d5f9cea6c4d05fa4b36b514e

Food image classification is a challenging problem, the solution of which can be of great benefit to many real-world applications such as nutrition and allergy estimation. Most of the previous studies proposed to use variations of convolutional neural networks to tackle the problem. However, due to the limited number of annotated food image datasets, there is still some room for improvement, especially in terms of accuracy and speed. Generally speaking, neural networks trained to solve image classification problems on a small dataset benefit from utilizing the weights of the networks that have been pre-trained on a large image classification dataset such as ImageNet. In this paper, we compare the trade-offs between training networks from scratch, deploying pre-trained networks as feature extractors, and fine-tuning the networks for Thai food image classification. By utilizing Transfer Learning with EfficientNetV1, we were able to achieve higher accuracy for Thai Food Image Classification on the largest publicly available Thai food image dataset, THFOOD-50. In particular, our proposed method improves upon the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art method from 84.06% to 91.49% while maintaining the speed for the prediction at 103 ms and 1205 ms for GPU and CPU, respectively.",2022,2022-10-31 00:00:00,5.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d97f2bc35be350d8c420bfcb32a6699f85a6d3a8

To protect birds and the diversity of species on earth, it is urgent to build an automatic bird image recognition system. Therefore, this paper assesses the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning models on image recognition. Also, the help-ability of transfer learning in the field of image recognition is tested to evaluate the best model for bird recognition systems. Three groups of classifiers for bird recognition were constructed, namely, classifiers based on the traditional machine learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning-based convolutional neural networks. After experiments, these three classifiers showed significant differences in the classification effect on the Kaggle-180-birds dataset. The experimental results finally prove that deep learning is more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms in image recognition as the number of bird species increases. Besides, the obtained results show that when the sample data is small, transfer learning can help the deep neural network classifier to improve classification accuracy.",2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,16.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/505e677d9eb4770ba7f309c315b29c2be2567dd1

This could be solved through automatic identification and diagnoses using deep learning. However, this technology is not yet explored and examined in the case of peanut leaf spot disease due to some aspects, such as the availability of sufficient data to be used for training and testing the model. This study is intended to explore the use of pre-trained visual geometry group–16 (VGG16), visual geometry group–19 (VGG19), InceptionV3, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 architectures and deep learning optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Momentum, adaptive moment estimation (Adam), root mean square propagation (RMSProp), and adaptive gradient algorithm (Adagrad) in creating a model that can identify leaf spot disease by using a total of 1,000 images of leaves captured using a mobile camera.

It has made a major contribution to medical image analysis as it overcomes the data scarcity problem as well as it saves time and hardware resources. However, transfer learning has been arbitrarily configured in the majority of studies. This review paper attempts to provide guidance for selecting a model and TL approaches for the medical image classification task. Methods 425 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from two databases, PubMed and Web of Science, published in English, up until December 31, 2020. Articles were assessed by two independent reviewers, with the aid of a third reviewer in the case of discrepancies. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for the paper selection and 121 studies were regarded as eligible for the scope of this review. We investigated articles focused on selecting backbone models and TL approaches including feature extractor, feature extractor hybrid, fine-tuning and fine-tuning from scratch. Results The majority of studies (n = 57) empirically evaluated multiple models followed by deep models (n = 33) and shallow (n = 24) models. Inception, one of the deep models, was the most employed in literature (n = 26). With respect to the TL, the majority of studies (n = 46) empirically benchmarked multiple approaches to identify the optimal configuration. The rest of the studies applied only a single approach for which feature extractor (n = 38) and fine-tuning from scratch (n = 27) were the two most favored approaches. Only a few studies applied feature extractor hybrid (n = 7) and fine-tuning (n = 3) with pretrained models. Conclusion The investigated studies demonstrated the efficacy of transfer learning despite the data scarcity. We encourage data scientists and practitioners to use deep models (e.g. ResNet or Inception) as feature extractors, which can save computational costs and time without degrading the predictive power.",2022,2022-04-13 00:00:00,451.0,154.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56e207c6ac14acf41a1294ee2f1442689210eb05

While IoT and IoT-powered decices can provide invaluable services in various fields, unauthorized access and inadvertent modification are potential issues of tremendous concern. In this paper, we present a process for resolving such IoT issues using adapted long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN). With this method, we utilize specialized deep learning (DL) methods to detect abnormal and/or suspect behavior in IoT systems. LSTM RNNs are adopted in order to construct a high-accuracy model capable of detecting suspicious behavior based on a dataset of IoT sensors readings.

10.1136/bmj.i6,"Net benefit approaches to the evaluation of prediction models, molecular markers, and diagnostic tests","Many decisions in medicine involve trade-offs, such as between diagnosing patients with disease versus unnecessary additional testing for those who are healthy. Net benefit is an increasingly reported decision analytic measure that puts benefits and harms on the same scale. This is achieved by specifying an exchange rate, a clinical judgment of the relative value of benefits (such as detecting a cancer) and harms (such as unnecessary biopsy) associated with models, markers, and tests. The exchange rate can be derived by asking simple questions, such as the maximum number of patients a doctor would recommend for biopsy to find one cancer. As the answers to these sorts of questions are subjective, it is possible to plot net benefit for a range of reasonable exchange rates in a “decision curve.” For clinical prediction models, the exchange rate is related to the probability threshold to determine whether a patient is classified as being positive or negative for a disease. Net benefit is useful for determining whether basing clinical decisions on a model, marker, or test would do more good than harm. This is in contrast to traditional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are statistical abstractions not directly informative about clinical value. Recent years have seen an increase in practical applications of net benefit analysis to research data. This is a welcome development, since decision analytic techniques are of particular value when the purpose of a model, marker, or test is to help doctors make better clinical decisions.",2016,2016-01-25 00:00:00,750.0,22.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45d1e781dcdb5464fe0859888df799309c56fd46

10.3390/make5030061,Early Thyroid Risk Prediction by Data Mining and Ensemble Classifiers,"Thyroid disease is among the most prevalent endocrinopathies worldwide. As the thyroid gland controls human metabolism, thyroid illness is a matter of concern for human health. To save time and reduce error rates, an automatic, reliable, and accurate thyroid identification machine-learning (ML) system is essential. The proposed model aims to address existing work limitations such as the lack of detailed feature analysis, visualization, improvement in prediction accuracy, and reliability. Here, a public thyroid illness dataset containing 29 clinical features from the University of California, Irvine ML repository was used. The clinical features helped us to build an ML model that can predict thyroid illness by analyzing early symptoms and replacing the manual analysis of these attributes. Feature analysis and visualization facilitate an understanding of the role of features in thyroid prediction tasks. In addition, the overfitting problem was eliminated by 5-fold cross-validation and data balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Ensemble learning ensures prediction model reliability owing to the involvement of multiple classifiers in the prediction decisions. The proposed model achieved 99.5% accuracy, 99.39% sensitivity, and 99.59% specificity with the boosting method which is applicable to real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to ease diagnosis and promote early treatment.",2023,2023-09-18 00:00:00,15.0,42.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c19212cf929834232dc60baef0670dbea2b40adc
10.3389/fendo.2023.1224191,Diagnosis of thyroid disease using deep convolutional neural network models applied to thyroid scintigraphy images: a multicenter study,"Objectives The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic performance of nuclear medicine physicians using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model and validate the results with two multicenter datasets for thyroid disease by analyzing clinical single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image data. Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, 3194 SPECT thyroid images were collected for model training (n=2067), internal validation (n=514) and external validation (n=613). First, four pretrained DCNN models (AlexNet, ShuffleNetV2, MobileNetV3 and ResNet-34) for were tested multiple medical image classification of thyroid disease types (i.e., Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, thyroid tumor and normal thyroid). The best performing model was then subjected to fivefold cross-validation to further assess its performance, and the diagnostic performance of this model was compared with that of junior and senior nuclear medicine physicians. Finally, class-specific attentional regions were visualized with attention heatmaps using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Results Each of the four pretrained neural networks attained an overall accuracy of more than 0.85 for the classification of SPECT thyroid images. The improved ResNet-34 model performed best, with an accuracy of 0.944. For the internal validation set, the ResNet-34 model showed higher accuracy (p < 0.001) when compared to that of the senior nuclear medicine physician, with an improvement of nearly 10%. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.931 for the external dataset, a significantly higher accuracy than that of the senior physician (0.931 vs. 0.868, p < 0.001). Conclusion The DCNN-based model performed well in terms of diagnosing thyroid scintillation images. The DCNN model showed higher sensitivity and greater specificity in identifying Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid tumors compared to those of nuclear medicine physicians, illustrating the feasibility of deep learning models to improve the diagnostic efficiency for assisting clinicians.",2023,2023-08-11 00:00:00,14.0,42.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30007c2f405fe460cf0dd93ea2f4ea3266a4d165

As a result, early detection was pertinent in preventing or minimizing the impact of this disease. In this study, different machine learning (ML) algorithms with a combination of scaling method, oversampling technique, and various feature selection approaches have been applied to make an efficient framework to classify TD. In addition, significant risk factors of TD were also identified in this proposed system. The dataset was collected from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository for this research. After that, in the preprocessing stage, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to resolve the imbalance class problem and robust scaling technique was used to scale the dataset. The Boruta, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches were used to select appropriate features. To train the model, we employed six different ML classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). The models were examined using a 5-fold CV. Different performance metrics were observed to compare the effectiveness of the algorithms. The system achieved the most accurate results using the RF classifier, with 99% accuracy. This proposed system will be beneficial for physicians and patients to classify TD as well as to learn about the associated risk factors of TD.",2023,2023-06-16 00:00:00,20.0,104.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/296a215314611c1fd303a2392e804cc1dd0de235
10.1007/s44230-023-00027-1,An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Framework for the Predictive Analysis of Hypo and Hyper Thyroidism Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"The thyroid gland is the crucial organ in the human body, secreting two hormones that help to regulate the human body’s metabolism. Thyroid disease is a severe medical complaint that could be developed by high Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels or an infection in the thyroid tissues. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are two critical conditions caused by insufficient thyroid hormone production and excessive thyroid hormone production, respectively. Machine learning models can be used to precisely process the data generated from different medical sectors and to build a model to predict several diseases. In this paper, we use different machine-learning algorithms to predict hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Moreover, we identified the most significant features, which can be used to detect thyroid diseases more precisely. After completing the pre-processing and feature selection steps, we applied our modified and original data to several classification models to predict thyroidism. We found Random Forest (RF) is giving the maximum evaluation score in all sectors in our dataset, and Naive Bayes is performing very poorly. Moreover selecting the feature by using the feature importance method RF provides the best accuracy of 91.42%, precision of 92%, recall of 92% and F1-score of 92%. Further, by analyzing the characteristics and behavior of the dataset, we identified the most important features (TSH, T3, TT4, and FTI) of the dataset. In terms of accuracy and other performance evaluation criteria, this study could advocate the use of effective classifiers and features backed by machine learning algorithms to detect and diagnose thyroid disease. Finally, we did some explainability analysis of our best classifier to understand the internal black-box of our machine learning model and datasets.

10.7717/peerj-cs.1394,A systematic review on artificial intelligence techniques for detecting thyroid diseases,"The use of artificial intelligence approaches in health-care systems has grown rapidly over the last few years. In this context, early detection of diseases is the most common area of application. In this scenario, thyroid diseases are an example of illnesses that can be effectively faced if discovered quite early. Detecting thyroid diseases is crucial in order to treat patients effectively and promptly, by saving lives and reducing healthcare costs. This work aims at systematically reviewing and analyzing the literature on various artificial intelligence-related techniques applied to the detection and identification of various diseases related to the thyroid gland. The contributions we reviewed are classified according to different viewpoints and taxonomies in order to highlight pros and cons of the most recent research in the field. After a careful selection process, we selected and reviewed 72 papers, analyzing them according to three main research questions, i.e., which diseases of the thyroid gland are detected by different artificial intelligence techniques, which datasets are used to perform the aforementioned detection, and what types of data are used to perform the detection. The review demonstrates that the majority of the considered papers deal with supervised methods to detect hypo- and hyperthyroidism. The average accuracy of detection is high (96.84%), but the usage of private and outdated datasets with a majority of clinical data is very common. Finally, we discuss the outcomes of the systematic review, pointing out advantages, disadvantages, and future developments in the application of artificial intelligence for thyroid diseases detection.",2023,2023-06-06 00:00:00,20.0,101.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a409af57fe9c8ca10597ae1da639087b6e71cdc

10.3390/s21030930,Research on the Prediction of Green Plum Acidity Based on Improved XGBoost,"The acidity of green plum has an important influence on the fruit’s deep processing. Traditional physical and chemical analysis methods for green plum acidity detection are destructive, time-consuming, and unable to achieve online detection. In response, a rapid and non-destructive detection method based on hyperspectral imaging technology was studied in this paper. Research on prediction performance comparisons between supervised learning methods and unsupervised learning methods is currently popular. To further improve the accuracy of component prediction, a new hyperspectral imaging system was developed, and the kernel principle component analysis—linear discriminant analysis—extreme gradient boosting algorithm (KPCA-LDA-XGB) model was proposed to predict the acidity of green plum. The KPCA-LDA-XGB model is a supervised learning model combined with the extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental results proved that the KPCA-LDA-XGB model offers good acidity predictions for green plum, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.829 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.107 for the prediction set. Compared with the basic XGBoost model, the KPCA-LDA-XGB model showed a 79.4% increase in R and a 31.2% decrease in RMSE. The use of linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial (Poly) kernel functions were also compared and analyzed in this paper to further optimize the KPCA-LDA-XGB model.",2021,2021-01-30 00:00:00,22.0,22.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/034d860700ee788ff8d5513b5c6a80da66968b4a

10.24990/injec.v2i2.43,KNEE FLEXION EXTENSION AND STRENGTHENING (FELS) EXERCISE TO PAIN INTENSITY IN KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS PATIENTS,"Introduction. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease due to the thinning of the joint cartilage, mostly in the knee joint (89.91%) with the pain manifestation. If the pain is not managed, it could lead to the limitation of movement and disruption of daily activities. Having physical exercise regularly could reduce pain. The purpose of study was to determine the effect of knee fl exion extension and strengthening (FELS) exercise in reducing pain intensity. Methods. This was a quasi-experimental study with pretest-posttest control randomized design, where 70 respondents were recruited and consisted of 53 in intervention and 17 in control group. Result. The statistical analysis used ordinal regression revealed (1) FELS exercise was effective in reducing pain intensity (p = 0.013); (2) a signifi cant difference in pain intensity before and after FELS exercise (p = 0.000); (3) a signifi cant difference of pain intensity in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0.004); (4) effect of other activities in reducing pain intensity (p = 0.042). While the factors of age, gender, pain experience, anxiety and support system were not signifi cantly effective in reducing pain. Discussion.

10.1186/s12984-017-0290-6,"NLR, MLP, SVM, and LDA: a comparative analysis on EMG data from people with trans-radial amputation","Currently, the typically adopted hand prosthesis surface electromyography (sEMG) control strategies do not provide the users with a natural control feeling and do not exploit all the potential of commercially available multi-fingered hand prostheses. Pattern recognition and machine learning techniques applied to sEMG can be effective for a natural control based on the residual muscles contraction of amputated people corresponding to phantom limb movements. As the researches has reached an advanced grade accuracy, these algorithms have been proved and the embedding is necessary for the realization of prosthetic devices. The aim of this work is to provide engineering tools and indications on how to choose the most suitable classifier, and its specific internal settings for an embedded control of multigrip hand prostheses. By means of an innovative statistical analysis, we compare 4 different classifiers: Nonlinear Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis, which was considered as ground truth. Experimental tests have been performed on sEMG data collected from 30 people with trans-radial amputation, in which the algorithms were evaluated for both performance and computational burden, then the statistical analysis has been based on the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. The comparative analysis among NLR, MLP and SVM shows that, for either classification performance and for the number of classification parameters, SVM attains the highest values followed by MLP, and then by NLR. However, using as unique constraint to evaluate the maximum acceptable complexity of each classifier one of the typically available memory of a high performance microcontroller, the comparison pointed out that for people with trans-radial amputation the algorithm that produces the best compromise is NLR closely followed by MLP. This result was also confirmed by the comparison with LDA with time domain features, which provided not significant differences of performance and computational burden between NLR and LDA. The proposed analysis would provide innovative engineering tools and indications on how to choose the most suitable classifier based on the application and the desired results for prostheses control.",2017,2017-08-14 00:00:00,97.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ebba747173d27f9110de8d11fe0da0d11ec2abdb
10.1002/imt2.36,"Sangerbox: A comprehensive, interaction‐friendly clinical bioinformatics analysis platform","Abstract In recent decades, with the continuous development of high‐throughput sequencing technology, data volume in medical research has increased, at the same time, almost all clinical researchers have their own independent omics data, which provided a better condition for data mining and a deeper understanding of gene functions. However, for these large amounts of data, many common and cutting‐edge effective bioinformatics research methods still cannot be widely used. This has encouraged the establishment of many analytical platforms, a portion of databases or platforms were designed to solve the special analysis needs of users, for instance, MG RAST, IMG/M, Qiita, BIGSdb, and TRAPR were developed for specific omics research, and some databases or servers provide solutions for special problems solutions. Metascape was designed to only provide functional annotations of genes as well as function enrichment analysis; BioNumerics and RidomSeqSphere+ perform multilocus sequence typing; CARD provides only antimicrobial resistance annotations. Additionally, some web services are outdated, and inefficient interaction often fails to meet the needs of researchers, such as our previous versions of the platform. Therefore, the demand to complete massive data processing tasks urgently requires a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis platform. Hence, we have developed a website platform, Sangerbox 3.0 (http://vip.sangerbox.com/), a web‐based tool platform. On a user‐friendly interface that also supports differential analysis, the platform provides interactive customizable analysis tools, including various kinds of correlation analyses, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted correlation network analysis, and other common tools and functions, users only need to upload their own corresponding data into Sangerbox 3.0, select required parameters, submit, and wait for the results after the task has been completed. We have also established a new interactive plotting system that allows users to adjust the parameters in the image; moreover, optimized plotting performance enables users to adjust large‐capacity vector maps on the web site. At the same time, we have integrated GEO, TCGA, ICGC, and other databases and processed data in batches, greatly reducing the difficulty to obtain data and improving the efficiency of bioimformatics study for users. Finally, we also provide users with rich sources of bioinformatics analysis courses, offering a platform for researchers to share and exchange knowledge.",2022,2022-07-08 00:00:00,618.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fabff697cd0ec343490f89e8e6587200d97f378
10.3389/fimmu.2022.871312,Characterization of Two TNF-Related Subtypes Predicting Infliximab Therapy Responses in Crohn’s Disease,"Background Anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is widely used to treat Crohn’s disease (CD). Unfortunately, 10%–40% of patients have primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy. TNF family genes play crucial roles in inflammation and immune regulation; however, the effects of TNF family genes on CD remain unclear. Methods CD expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Unsupervised clustering was then used to identify the gene subtypes in CD based on the expressions of TNF family genes. The features of the gene subtypes were characterized using functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses, and biomarkers of the gene subtypes were identified. Results Patients with CD were divided on the basis of unsupervised clustering into two gene subtypes: immune and metabolic. Gene subtype A was significantly correlated with leukocyte migration and cytokine interactions, whereas gene subtype B was associated with metabolic pathways. Whereas 89.5% of the patients in gene subtype B responded to infliximab, only 16.7% of patients in gene subtype A responded. In addition, a combination of interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), interleukin 6 (IL6), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) can effectively distinguish between gene subtypes A and B. Conclusion Comprehensive analyses of the TNF family genes may reveal the underlying pathogenesis of CD. The classification of subtypes may provide new ideas for the personalized treatment of patients with CD.",2022,2022-04-22 00:00:00,4.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03327d34c5a42b422a0ce9596f4ca6c7767f1425

10.2147/JIR.S338053,Construction of ceRNA Network to Reveal Potential Biomarkers in Crohn’s Disease and Validation in a TNBS Induced Mice Model,"Purpose We aimed to construct a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and explore the potential biomarkers in Crohn’s disease (CD) via bioinformatics analysis. Validation of candidate biomarkers in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced experimental colitis model and ceRNA network in an HCT116 cell line was also an aim, along with purposing to reveal the pathogenesis of CD. Methods GSE102134 and GSE67106 datasets were obtained and used to screen the differentially expressed genes. WCGNA was applied to identify the relative model to construct the ceRNA network. Furthermore, the relationship between candidate gene and immune infiltration was investigated. Then, the expression of potential biomarkers was validated via qRT-PCR in a TNBS induced experimental colitis model. Finally, the ceRNA network was confirmed by RNAi experiments in an HCT116 cell line. Results The ceRNA network, consisting of four lncRNAs, four miRNAs, and eight mRNAs, was constructed and the ROC analysis showed four mRNAs (PTGS2, LPL, STAT1, and TRIB2) had high diagnostic accuracy (AUC>0.9). In addition, upregulated PTGS2 was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including Natural killer cells, exhausted T-cells, monocytes, and Dendritic cells. The outcome of this TNBS induced experimental colitis model verified that the expression of PTGS2 and mir-429 was consistent with results of previous bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the predicted ceRNA network MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 were validated via RNA interference. Knockout of MIR3142HG decreased the mRNA level of PTGS2, whereas inhibition of mir-429 increased the mRNA level of PTGS2 in the HCT116 cell line. Conclusion The exploration of the ceRNA network in this work might contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of CD. The constructed MIR3142HG/mir-429/PTGS2 ceRNA network may play a role in CD, and PTGS2 can be a potential immune-related biomarker in CD.",2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,7.0,47.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a80c4f36fffb31d3ec222d31aba34a185d35e2d
10.4049/jimmunol.2100220,Regulation and Role of αE Integrin and Gut Homing Integrins in Migration and Retention of Intestinal Lymphocytes during Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Key Points Adhesion molecules are upregulated in inflamed intestinal mucosa in IBD patients. Baseline β7 expression does not impact αE induction or gene expression in T cells. Phospho-SMAD3 is increased in inflamed mucosa in IBD. Targeting interactions between α4β7 integrin and endothelial adhesion molecule MAdCAM-1 to inhibit lymphocyte migration to the gastrointestinal tract is an effective therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Following lymphocyte entry into the mucosa, a subset of these cells expresses αEβ7 integrin, which is expressed on proinflammatory lymphocytes, to increase cell retention. The factors governing lymphocyte migration into the intestinal mucosa and αE integrin expression in healthy subjects and IBD patients remain incompletely understood. We evaluated changes in factors involved in lymphocyte migration and differentiation within tissues. Both ileal and colonic tissue from active IBD patients showed upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1 at the gene and protein levels compared with healthy subjects and/or inactive IBD patients. β1 and β7 integrin expression on circulating lymphocytes was similar across groups. TGF-β1 treatment induced expression of αE on both β7+ and β7− T cells, suggesting that cells entering the mucosa independently of MAdCAM-1/α4β7 can become αEβ7+. ITGAE gene polymorphisms did not alter protein induction following TGF-β1 stimulation. Increased phospho-SMAD3, which is directly downstream of TGF-β, and increased TGF-β–responsive gene expression were observed in the colonic mucosa of IBD patients. Finally, in vitro stimulation experiments showed that baseline β7 expression had little effect on cytokine, chemokine, transcription factor, and effector molecule gene expression in αE+ and αE− T cells. These findings suggest cell migration to the gut mucosa may be altered in IBD and α4β7−, and α4β7+ T cells may upregulate αEβ7 in response to TGF-β once within the gut mucosa.",2021,2021-09-24 00:00:00,36.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d0dfd779771e884ac2d8b53e5c6c4e2f45a4bd4

10.1038/s41598-020-68993-1,Monocytes from infliximab-resistant patients with Crohn’s disease exhibit a disordered cytokine profile,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by immune response dysregulation. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of CD, as indicated by the efficacy of anti-TNF-α therapy with infliximab (IFX). However, approximately 30–40% of CD patients fail to respond to IFX with still unclear underlying mechanisms. This study compares the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes from CD patients, who respond or non-respond to IFX. Under basal conditions, the mRNA for the cytokines TNFα, IL-23, IL-1β and the chemokines CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES and CCL2/MCP-1 was up-regulated in monocytes from non-responders than responders. The expression of the same cytokines and CCL2/MCP-1 was higher in non-responders also upon LPS treatment. Moreover, higher secretion of TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ and IL-2 proteins occurred in the supernatants of LPS-treated non-responders cells. Resistance to IFX in CD may result from a transcriptional dysregulation of circulating monocytes, leading to hyperactivation of pro-inflammatory pathways. Monocytes’ cytokine profile may thus represent a predictive marker of response to IFX. Monocytes were isolated from blood samples of 19 CD patients (11 responders, 8 non-responders) and incubated with or without LPS. Cytokine profiles were assessed by RT-qPCR and, in the supernatants, by ELISA assay.",2020,2020-07-22 00:00:00,14.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cffb7b4ee8e274ea12f894b1fbdb6a3a0e522149

10.3390/w14203242,Assessment of Activating Reservoir Emergency Storage in Climate-Change-Fueled Extreme Drought,"With exacerbating climate change, the current reservoir storage capacity in South Korea is insufficient to meet the future scheduled water demand. No study has yet evaluated the effects of applying the water supply adjustment standard (Standard) and activating the reservoir emergency storage in response to extreme drought. The main objective is to assess the effects of applying Standard and activating emergency storage in meeting the water demand under extreme drought at six multipurpose reservoirs (Andong, Gimcheon-Buhang, Gunwi, Hapcheon, Imha, and Milyang) in the Nakdong River Basin, South Korea. We built a reservoir simulation model (HEC-ResSim), determined the extreme drought scenarios, and emergency storage capacity. We evaluated three reservoir operation cases (general operation, regular Standard, and revised Standard) from 2011 to 2100. The results show that applying the Standard and activating the emergency storage are effective in meeting the future water demand during extreme drought. In conclusion, we need to secure 110 million cubic meters (MCM) (Hapcheon reservoir) and 8 MCM (Gunwi reservoir) of water to reduce the number of days in the emergency stage. This research serves as a fundamental study that can help establish Standard and emergency storage activation criteria for other multipurpose reservoirs in preparation for extreme drought.",2022,2022-10-14 00:00:00,5.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36562749b4b402552304535868d9a929e0d8c01f

Machine-learning tools have the potential to improve groundwater prediction, thus enabling resource planners to: (1) anticipate water quality in unsampled areas or depth zones; (2) design targeted monitoring programs; (3) inform groundwater protection strategies; and (4) evaluate the sustainability of groundwater sources of drinking water. This paper proposes a machine-learning approach to groundwater prediction with the following characteristics: (i) the use of a regression-based approach to predict full groundwater images based on sequences of monthly groundwater maps; (ii) strategic automatic feature selection (both local and global features) using extreme gradient boosting; and (iii) the use of a multiplicity of machine-learning techniques (extreme gradient boosting, multivariate linear regression, random forests, multilayer perceptron and support vector regression). Of these techniques, support vector regression consistently performed best in terms of minimizing root mean square error and mean absolute error.

The removal of barriers may be different for each country or region, as each differs greatly in terms of politics, economy and social and cultural awareness. This paper addresses the complex problem of removing dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs. We demonstrate the scales of the changes, including their major ecological, economic, and social impacts. Arguments and approaches to this problem vary across states and regions, depending on the political system, economy and culture, as confirmed by the qualitative and quantitative intensities of the dam removal process and its global geographical variation. The results indicate that the removal of dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs applies predominantly to smaller structures (< 2.5 m). The existing examples provide an important conclusion that dams and reservoirs should be considered with regard to the interrelations between people and the environment. Decisions to deconstruct hydraulic engineering structures (or, likewise, to construct them) have to be applied with scrutiny.

Left unnoticed and untreated, the deterioration in a health condition could even result in mortality. If it can be detected early, with proper treatment, undesirable outcomes can be avoided. Until now, the gold standard is the invasive way of measuring blood pressure (BP) using a catheter. Additionally, the cuff-based and noninvasive methods are too cumbersome or inconvenient for frequent measurement of BP. With the advancement of sensor technology, signal processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms, researchers are trying to find the perfect relationships between biomedical signals and changes in BP. This paper is a literature review of the studies conducted on the cuffless noninvasive measurement of BP using biomedical signals. Relevant articles were selected using specific criteria, then traditional techniques for BP measurement were discussed along with a motivation for cuffless measurement use of biomedical signals and machine learning algorithms. The review focused on the progression of different noninvasive cuffless techniques rather than comparing performance among different studies. The literature survey concluded that the use of deep learning proved to be the most accurate among all the cuffless measurement techniques. On the other side, this accuracy has several disadvantages, such as lack of interpretability, computationally extensive, standard validation protocol, and lack of collaboration with health professionals. Additionally, the continuing work by researchers is progressing with a potential solution for these challenges.

However, for conscious individuals, traditional cuff-based BP monitoring devices are often uncomfortable, intermittent, and impractical for frequent measurements. Continuous and non-invasive BP (NIBP) monitoring is currently gaining attention in the human health monitoring area due to its promising potentials in assessing the health status of an individual, enabled by machine learning (ML), for various purposes such as early prediction of disease and intervention treatment. This review presents the development of a non-invasive BP measuring tool called sphygmomanometer in brief, summarizes state-of-the-art NIBP sensors, and identifies extended works on continuous NIBP monitoring using commercial devices. Moreover, the NIBP predictive techniques including pulse arrival time, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, and ML are elaborated on the basis of bio-signals acquisition from these sensors. Additionally, the different BP values (systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure) of the various ML models adopted in several reported studies are compared in terms of the international validation standards developed by the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) for clinically-approved BP monitors.

We extracted information about study characteristics, device features, validation processes, and clinical applications. Devices were classified according to their functions and features. We defined devices with a mean systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) biases of <5 mmHg as valid as a consensus. Our definition of validity did not include assessment of device measurement precision, which is assessed by standard deviation of the mean difference—a critical component of ISO protocol validation criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 tool. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to summarise the mean biases for SBP and DBP across studies. Of the 430 studies identified, 16 studies (15 devices, 974 participants) were selected. The majority of devices (81.3%) used photoplethysmography to estimate BP against a reference device; other technologies included tonometry, auscultation and electrocardiogram. In addition to BP and heart rate, some devices also measured night-time BP (n = 5), sleep monitoring (n = 3), oxygen saturation (n = 3), temperature (n = 2) and electrocardiogram (n = 3). Eight devices showed mean biases of <5 mmHg for SBP and DBP compared with a reference device and three devices were commercially available. The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the wearable and reference devices for SBP (pooled mean difference = 3.42 mmHg, 95% CI: −2.17, 9.01, I2 95.4%) and DBP (pooled mean = 1.16 mmHg, 95% CI: −1.26, 3.58, I2 87.1%). Conclusion Several cuffless BP devices are currently available using different technologies, offering the potential for continuous BP monitoring. The variation in standards and validation protocols limited the comparability of findings across studies and the identification of the most accurate device. Challenges such as validation using standard protocols and in real-life settings must be overcome before they can be recommended for uptake into clinical practice.",2022,2022-05-02 00:00:00,34.0,1.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a98bfc585e972234c18e4d6595148a7525babfd9

However, in practice, there is no universal FHE scheme that is effi-cient in all possible use cases. In this work, we show that FHE schemes suitable for arithmetic circuits (e.g. BGV or BFV) have a similar performance as FHE schemes for non-arithmetic circuits (TFHE) in basic comparison tasks such as less-than, maximum and minimum operations. Our implementation of the less-than function in the HElib library is up to 3 times faster than the prior work based on BGV/BFV. It allows to compare a pair of 64-bit integers in 11 milliseconds, sort 64 32-bit integers in 19 seconds and find the minimum of 64 32-bit integers in 9.5 seconds on an average laptop without multi-threading.",2021,2021-04-27 00:00:00,88.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/868407cd7c2491c596c416b3c287eb19596d1035

10.1515/nanoph-2024-0025,Hollow core optical fiber enabled by epsilon-near-zero material,"Abstract Hollow core optical fibers of numerous guiding mechanisms have been studied in the past decades for their advantages on guiding light in air core. This work demonstrates a new hollow core optical fiber based on a different guiding mechanism, which confines light with a cladding made of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material through total internal reflection. We show that the addition of a layer of ENZ material coating (e.g. indium tin oxide layer) significantly reduces the loss of the waveguide compared to the structure without the ENZ layer. We also show that the propagation loss of the ENZ hollow core fiber can be further improved by integrating ENZ materials with lower loss. This study presents a novel type of hollow core fiber, and can find advanced in-fiber photonic applications such as laser surgery/spectroscopy, novel gas-filled/discharge laser, in-fiber molecular/gas sensing, and low-latency optical fiber communication.",2024,2024-03-01 00:00:00,3.0,38.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d14e92544be4cf2129ea004e1d3a0fec9388eb2e
10.1515/nanoph-2023-0906,Topological phase transition and surface states in a non-Abelian charged nodal line photonic crystal,"Abstract Topological charges of nodal lines in a multigap system are represented by non-Abelian numbers, and the Euler class, a topological invariant, can be used to explain their topological phase transitions, such as pair-annihilation of nodal lines. Up until now, no discussion of phase transitions of nodal lines in photonic crystals using the Euler class has been reported, despite the fact that the Euler class and topological phase transition have recently been addressed in metallic or acoustic crystals. Here, we show how the deformation of a photonic crystal causes topological phase transitions in the nodal lines, and the Euler class can be used to theoretically predict the nodal lines’ stability based on the non-Abelian topological charge theory. Specifically, by manipulating the separation between the two single diamond structures and the extent of structural distortion, we numerically demonstrate the topological transition of nodal lines, e.g., from nodal lines to nodal rings. We then demonstrate that the range of surface states is strongly influenced by the topological phase transition of nodal lines. Moreover, the Zak phase was used to explain the surface states’ existence.",2024,2024-02-23 00:00:00,2.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03865e2c2ba5702ae1ecdbb08d9f2e1f199b3849
10.1515/nanoph-2023-0824,Thermally tunable binary-phase VO2 metasurfaces for switchable holography and digital encryption,"Abstract Metasurface holography has aroused immense interest in producing holographic images with high quality, higher-order diffraction-free, and large viewing angles by using a planar artificial sheet consisting of subwavelength nanostructures. Despite remarkable progress, dynamically tunable metasurface holography in the visible band has rarely been reported due to limited available tuning methods. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate a thermally tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanofin based binary-phase metasurface, which generates holographic information in the visible varying with temperature. The insulator-to-metal phase transition in VO2 nanofins allows two independent binary-phase holograms generated by machine learning to be encoded in the respective phases of VO2 and switched under thermal regulation. By elaborately designing the dimensions and compensated phase of VO2 nanofins, high-quality images are reconstructed at corresponding temperatures under appropriate chiral illumination. In contrast, much poorer images are produced under inappropriate chiral illumination. We further demonstrate the advantage of applying the VO2 phase-compensated metasurface in high-security digital encryption, where two desired character combinations are read out with appropriate excitations and temperatures, whereas one identical fraudulent message is received with inappropriate excitations. Our design approach offers a new and efficient method to realize tunable metasurfaces, which is promisingly adopted in dynamic display, information encryption, optical anti-counterfeiting, etc.",2024,2024-02-21 00:00:00,14.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21004e072bc910d007350615765b2f6bf49ac5e8

Experimentally determined aspect ratio, i.e. the ratio between the cavity and nanoparticle size, for hollow structures formed under different irradiation conditions shows a very good agreement with values obtained by means of atomistic simulations. According to the predictions of the atomistic model, one can produce at will hollow silver nanoparticles with cavities of tailored dimensions, having an accurate control. Hence, laser irradiation can be used to control and design the optical response by tuning the localized surface plasmon resonances of the hollow nanoparticles.",2024,2024-02-16 00:00:00,3.0,65.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/920bbb74aa5a2d2c4edf211f0df1d8280644553a

To explore metamaterials with nanoscale topologies, interest in three-dimensional nanofabrication methods has grown and led to rapid production of target nanostructures over large areas. Additionally, inverse design methods have revolutionized materials science, enabling the optimization of microstructures and topologies to achieve the desired properties without extensive experimental cycles. This review highlights the recent progress in inverse design methods applied in proximity-field nanopatterning. It introduces novel approaches, such as adjoint methods and particle swarm optimization, to achieve target topologies and high-resolution nanostructures. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms for inverse design are explored, demonstrating the potential efficacy of the phase-mask design. This comprehensive review offers insights into the progress of inverse design using phase modulation to realize target topologies of nanostructures.",2024,2024-02-15 00:00:00,5.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/df3ab036ce04ecd0067c90abf585330291f173b7

Instead of using the conventional approach that only the dipolar plasmonic mode is considered, we calculate the electric field enhancement in the nanometre sized gap, by taking account of the higher order modes in one gold sphere, which couples to the dipolar mode of the other sphere. The experimental confirmation is performed by gap-dependent tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) measurements. The photoluminescence and Raman enhancement are both observed with different growing trends as the gap width decreases. Red-shift of the background spectra is observed and implies the increasing coupling between the nanospheres. This analytic model is shown to be able to interpret the enhancement mechanisms underlying gap-dependent TERS experimental results.",2024,2024-02-02 00:00:00,1.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/97e2b51ec863de4297cae0d6fa29b3978639a839

This study aims to experimentally demonstrate ultrafast acousto-optic phenomena in the broad NIR spectral range of 0.77–1.1 eV (1130–1610 nm). Hundreds of GHz of light modulation are revealed in an all-optical configuration by combining ultrafast optical spectroscopy and light–sound conversion in 10–20 nm-thick bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) van der Waals thin films. The modified optical transition energy and the line shape in the NIR band indicate phonon–photon interactions, resulting in a modulation of optical characteristics by the photoexcited interlayer vibrations in Bi2Se3. This all-optical, ultrafast acousto-optic modulation approach may open avenues for next-generation nanophotonic applications, including optical communications and processing, due to the synergistic combination of large-area capability, high photo-responsivity, and frequency tunability in the NIR spectral range.",2024,2024-02-02 00:00:00,1.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c600818b4108089e57e391c8f8e467bc88de7741

To achieve this, advanced components such as high-performance intensity/phase modulators, waveguides, multiplexers, splitters, combiners, and filters operating in terahertz (THz) regime, specifically within the frequency range of 0.1–1 THz, are essential. However, existing microwave equipment and vector network analyzers designed for this frequency range suffer from limitations in resolution, stability, and accuracy when evaluating the intensity and phase responses of critical 6G THz devices. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the critical device requirements and emerging trends in next-generation 6G communication, essential performance evaluation parameters, comparisons between microwave and nano/microphotonic devices for testing, and the application of high-resolution THz sensors in 6G Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios. Notably, a frequency comb in the photonic regime emerges as the prime candidate for achieving precision evaluations of 6G networks and devices. Consequently, this review highlights the latest research in frequency comb measurements in the 6G THz frequency regime, with a particular emphasis on nano/microphotonic devices and metamaterials. The integration of frequency comb measurements into 6G and THz photonic devices and networks promises to accelerate the realization of high-density next-generation 6G communication.",2024,2024-01-31 00:00:00,8.0,135.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27e91327c81123fef37efb157673e9f64603ba95
10.1515/nanoph-2023-0826,Probing the multi-disordered nanoscale alloy at the interface of lateral heterostructure of MoS2–WS2,"Abstract Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) heterostructure, particularly the lateral heterostructure of two different TMDs, is gaining attention as ultrathin photonic devices based on the charge transfer (CT) excitons generated at the junction. However, the characteristics of the interface of the lateral heterostructure, determining the electronic band structure and alignment at the heterojunction region, have rarely been studied due to the limited spatial resolution of nondestructive analysis systems. In this study, we investigated the confined phonons resulting from the phonon-disorder scattering process involving multiple disorders at the lateral heterostructure interface of MoS2–WS2 to prove the consequences of disorder-mediated deformation in the band structure. Moreover, we directly observed variations in the metal composition of the multi-disordered nanoscale alloy Mo1−x W x S2, consisting of atomic vacancies, crystal edges, and distinct nanocrystallites. Our findings through tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) imply that a tens of nanometer area of continuous TMDs alloy forms the multi-disordered interface of the lateral heterostructure. The results of this study could present the way for the evaluation of the TMDs lateral heterostructure for excitonic applications.",2024,2024-01-19 00:00:00,1.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49b30ce3ab4d5ce8e9ee34ebda02089600f3ffc5
10.1515/nanoph-2023-0656,Scalable hot carrier–assisted silicon photodetector array based on ultrathin gold film,"Abstract Silicon (Si) offers cost-effective production and convenient on-chip integration for photodetection due to its well-established CMOS technology. However, the indirect bandgap of Si inherently limits its detection efficiency in the near-infrared (NIR) regime. Here, we propose a strategy to achieve high NIR photoresponse in Si by introducing a strong light-absorbing ultrathin gold (Au) film to generate hot carriers. Using a 4.6 nm thick-Au film deposited on Si, we achieved photoresponsivity of 1.6 mA/W at 1310 nm under zero-bias conditions, and rapid temporal responses of 7.5 and 8 μs for rise and fall times, respectively, comparable to germanium (Ge) photodiodes. By utilizing an ultrathin (<6 nm) Au film as the light-detecting layer and thicker (>100 nm) Au film as electrodes, we introduce a unique approach to design a photodiode array based on a single metal (Au) platform. Comparative analysis with a commercial beam profiler image validates the performance of our designed array. This work presents an efficient strategy for manufacturing cost-effective and scalable NIR photodetector arrays, which eliminates the need for additional insulator layers.",2024,2024-01-16 00:00:00,5.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/682f49d4e8fce38c5123982d3270aeaa12b2e95d

10.1039/c7cp04913g,"A look at the density functional theory zoo with the advanced GMTKN55 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions.","We present the GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions. Compared to its popular predecessor GMTKN30 [Goerigk and Grimme J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2011, 7, 291], it allows assessment across a larger variety of chemical problems-with 13 new benchmark sets being presented for the first time-and it also provides reference values of significantly higher quality for most sets. GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community via a dedicated website. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of better reference values, and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems, including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are ωB97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and ωB97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods.

10.1371/journal.pone.0215030,"Pilots and athletes: Different concerns, similar concussion non-disclosure","Objectives Concussion non-disclosure research has focused almost exclusively on athletes. The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes’ demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons. Methods We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy. Results The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p < 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.50). Conclusions These results suggest that cultures of concussion non-disclosure can develop in any population where disclosure is perceived as having undesirable consequences, not just athletic populations. Concussion researchers and practitioners should devote more attention to the perceived cost-benefit structures that create concussion non-disclosure to address this crucial public health issue more effectively.",2019,2019-05-01 00:00:00,33.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8433ce89b92a4a263b8e169f493bf830f2ad3f8

10.3390/en16062628,A Future with Machine Learning: Review of Condition Assessment of Structures and Mechanical Systems in Nuclear Facilities,"The nuclear industry is exploring applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including autonomous control and management of reactors and components. A condition assessment framework that utilizes AI and sensor data is an important part of such an autonomous control system. A nuclear power plant has various structures, systems, and components (SSCs) such as piping-equipment that carries coolant to the reactor. Piping systems can degrade over time because of flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion. Any cracks and leakages can cause loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The current industry standards for conducting maintenance of vital SSCs can be time and cost-intensive. AI can play a greater role in the condition assessment and can be extended to recognize concrete degradation (chloride-induced damage and alkali–silica reaction) before cracks develop. This paper reviews developments in condition assessment and AI applications of structural and mechanical systems. The applicability of existing techniques to nuclear systems is somewhat limited because its response requires characterization of high and low-frequency vibration modes, whereas previous studies focus on systems where a single vibration mode can define the degraded state. Data assimilation and storage is another challenging aspect of autonomous control. Advances in AI and data mining world can help to address these challenges.",2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,18.0,180.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d7da5e49d1458ca419393a872913da9aa092c62

In recent years however, synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SRμCT) has become a tool for extending the imaging of two-dimensional thin sections into three-dimensional imaging of tissue blocks, enabling so-called virtual histology with arbitrary clipping planes, volumetric rendering and automatic segmentation. In this study, we present a thorough characterization of human carotid plaques after endarterectomy of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), investigating several different pathologic structures using both SRμCT and histology. Phase-contrast SRμCT was performed with two different magnifications (voxel sizes 6.5 μm and 0.65 μm, respectively), and histology was performed with multiple different stainings (Alpha-actin, Glycophorin A, von Kossa, Movat, CD68). The 0.65 μm high-resolution SRμCT was performed on selected areas with plaque typical relevant morphology, identified on the 6.5 μm low-resolution SRμCT. The tomography datasets were reconstructed with additional 3D volume rendering and compared to histology. In total, nine different regions with typical pathologic structures were identified and imaged with high-resolution SRμCT. The results show many characteristics typical for advanced atherosclerotic plaques, clinically relevant, namely ruptures with thrombosis, neo-vascularization, inflammatory infiltrates in shoulder regions, lipid rich necrotic cores (LRNC), thin fibrous cap, calcifications, lumen irregularities, and changes in vessel wall structures such as the internal elastic membrane. This method’s non-destructive nature renders details of micro-structures with an excellent visual likeness to histology, with the additional strength of multiplanar and 3D visualization and the possibility of multiple re-scans.",2022,2022-04-26 00:00:00,4.0,24.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db47e2993091431e419e8ce59ac9a3e20f6aa4eb

Visualization of such small structures in vivo with high spatial resolution is an unsolved issue. The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) in the determination of atherosclerotic plaques with calcifications by validating this technique with micro-computer tomography (micro-CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The fibrocalcific plaques were obtained from 12 different patients and initially examined with micro-CT. The images exhibited calcifications within these plaques. For imaging with SAM, approximately 5 μm thick slices were prepared. Sound speed values within calcified regions were measured to be greater than the ones in collagen-rich regions. These fibrocalcific plaques were also examined with SEM and EDS revealing collagen and calcium deposition within these samples.

Iron is believed to accumulate within plaque by incorporation of erythrocytes following plaque rupture and hemorrhage. There is only indirect evidence to support this hypothesis. Plaque specimens were obtained from ten symptomatic and fifteen asymptomatic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy at a single institution. Plaques were sectioned for study using synchrotron radiation induced X-ray fluorescence the study the distribution of zinc, calcium and iron. Histologic staining was carried out with Prussian Blue, and immunohistochemical staining was done to localize macrophages with CD68. Data were compared against patient clinical variables. Ten symptomatic (15 ± 10 days between index symptoms and surgery) and fifteen asymptomatic carotid plaques were studied. Zinc and calcium co-localized in mineralized areas of symptomatic and asymptomatic plaque. Iron was identified away from zinc and calcium in both symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques. Within the symptomatic plaques, iron was found within the thrombus associated with plaque rupture and hemorrhage. It did not stain with Prussian Blue, but was found in association with CD68 positive macrophages. In symptomatic plaques, the abundance of iron showed an association with the source patient’s LDL cholesterol (R2 = 0.39, Significance F = 0.05). Iron in asymptomatic plaque was present as hemosiderin/ferritin that stained positive with Prussian Blue, and was observed in association with CD68 positive macrophages.

Early histologists used the readily available chemicals to prepare tissues for microscopic studies; these laboratory chemicals were potassium dichromate, alcohol and the mercuric chloride to harden cellular tissues. Staining techniques used were carmine, silver nitrate, Giemsa, Trichrome Stains, Gram Stain and Hematoxylin among others. The purpose of this research was to assess past and current literature reviews, as well as case studies, with the aim of informing ways in which histological stains have been improved in the modern age. Results from the literature review has indicated that there has been an improvement in histopathology and histotechnology in stains used. There has been a rising need for efficient, accurate and less complex staining procedures. Many stain procedures are still in use today, and many others have been replaced with new immunostaining, molecular, non-culture and other advanced staining techniques. Some staining methods have been abandoned because the chemicals required have been medically proven to be toxic. The case studies indicated that in modern histology a combination of different stain techniques are used to enhance the effectiveness of the staining process.

10.3390/beverages8010015,Beer Quality Evaluation—A Sensory Aspect,"The world’s beer market has never been more diverse. Most beers are produced in modern and technologically advanced breweries that use high quality raw materials, thus resulting in minor differences of physical–chemical properties between various beers (of the same style). However, consumers focus on constant quality and sensory properties of their chosen beer. Sensory evaluation is not an easy task and involves flexible methods for determination of differences and changes between beers. It is commonly used in breweries to provide constant quality of finished products, but also to ensure the quality of different raw materials (water, malt, hops) and to minimize the influence of the production process on final quality of beer.",2022,2022-03-02 00:00:00,8.0,24.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cc3d06b4eba2711aee118d7f167e4ebb1889d6b
10.3390/pharmaceutics14020420,Evaluating the Taste Masking Ability of Two Novel Dispersible Tablet Platforms Containing Zinc Sulfate and Paracetamol Reconstituted in a Breast Milk Substitute,"Milk is often used as a dispersion medium for medicines administration in young children but its taste-masking ability is unknown. A human taste panel was conducted to assess the potential of infant formula milk (Aptamil® 1) to mask the taste of two model WHO priority medicines, zinc sulfate and paracetamol, manufactured as dispersible tablets. Simultaneously, the palatability of powder blends of the tablet platforms was assessed. Twenty healthy adult volunteers performed a swirl-and-spit assessment of placebos and API-containing blends in either a lactose-based or a mannitol-based dispersible tablet platform, reconstituted in 10 mL of either water or Aptamil® 1. Eighteen samples were rated for aversion using a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale, grittiness using a 5-point Likert scale, and “acceptability-as-a-medicine” evaluated as: “Would you find this sample acceptable to swallow as a medicine?” with binary answers of Yes/No. The API-containing formulations were more aversive than the placebos; the paracetamol-containing samples being more aversive than zinc sulfate samples. The platforms themselves were not aversive. Non-gritty samples had four-fold greater odds of being acceptable as a medicine. Aptamil® 1 masked the taste of zinc sulfate in the mannitol-based formulation but did not mask the taste of paracetamol in either platform, suggesting a limited taste-masking ability, which may be API and formulation dependent.",2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,4.0,47.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7fd12a9f8cdf0b88ca5016cba004138590aaf496

In order to solve these problems, hot-melt extrusion (HME) was used to prepare azithromycin amorphous solid dispersion. Preliminary selection of a polymer for HME was conducted by calculating Hansen solubility parameter to predict the miscibility of the drug and polymer. Eudragit® RL PO was chosen as the polymer due to its combination of taste-masking effect and dissolution. Moreover, the solubility was improved with this polymer. Design of experiments (DoE) was used to optimize the formulation and process, with screw speed, extrusion temperature, and drug percentage as independent variables, and content, dissolution, and extrudates diameter as dependent variables. The optimal extrusion parameters were obtained as follows: temperature—150 °C; screw speed—75 rpm; and drug percentage—25%. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) studies of the powdered solid dispersions showed that the crystalline AZI transformed into the amorphous form. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicated that the formation of a hydrogen bond between AZI and the polymer led to the stabilization of AZI in its amorphous form. In conclusion, this work illustrated the importance of HME for the preparation of amorphous solid dispersion of AZI, which can solve the problems of bitterness and low solubility. It is also of great significance for the development of compliant pediatric AZI preparation.",2022,2022-01-26 00:00:00,24.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ceb7fb7ce156ff5e1aa2f137d4e66fc830d9672
10.1038/s41390-021-01920-w,Taste function in children: normative values and associated factors,"Although less frequent than in adults, taste loss also occurs in childhood. “Taste Strips” are frequently used for diagnosing taste dysfunction; however, normative values are lacking for children. In this study, we will create normative values for the “Taste Strips” in children. This cross-sectional study included 609 children aged 6–15 years. “Taste Strips” were used to determine sweet, sour, salty, and bitter taste scores by a non-forced procedure. The 10th percentile was used to distinguish normal taste function from a reduced sense of taste. Multivariable generalized linear models (GLM) were estimated to study the effect of age (group), sex, and 6‐n‐propylthiouracil (PROP) status on taste function. Taste function changed with age, allowing for a distinction of three age groups: (I) 6–7 years, (II) 8–9 years, and (III) 10–15 years. Normative values were created for the age groups and boys and girls separately. Additionally, GLM showed a significant effect of (1) age (group) on sweet, salty, bitter, and total taste scores; (2) sex on sweet, sour, and total taste scores; and (3) PROP status on total taste scores. This study provided normative values for the “Taste Strips” in children, highlighting age- and sex-related differences. Taste dysfunction can be harmful and impacts quality of life, a topic that became increasingly important since the COVID-19 pandemic. Although taste dysfunction is thought to be rare in childhood, the detrimental impact of such dysfunction might be large, as children’s eating habits are strongly influenced by input from the chemical senses. Measuring taste function may elucidate the relationship between taste dysfunction and disease, fostering the development of more appropriate supportive strategies. However, adequate tools are lacking for children. Normative values of the “Taste Strips” are now available for children, which bolster the clinical utility of this test.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004777,The Maximum Entropy Fallacy Redux?,"Protein structure can be predicted in silico given sufficiently good templates, as demonstrated in successive installments of the biannual Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition [1]. Since the number of known protein sequences currently increases much faster than the number of known protein structures, and is likely to continue to do so in the foreseeable future, reliable ab initio protein structure prediction, without recourse to templates, would be highly desirable. It is currently not possible to achieve sufficient sampling in unrestrained folding to achieve predictions close to the native structure. Recently, very important progress has been made on the restricted problem of predicting spatial amino acid contacts in proteins from many homologous sequences [2]. While it is not yet clear if these techniques, collectively known as direct coupling analysis (DCA), can be leveraged to systematically predict full protein structures, preliminary results indicate that this may be the case [3,4]. DCA has also been used with success for several related problems, such as predicting structures of protein complexes [4] or alternative protein conformations [5]. 
 
The central ingredient in DCA is to learn generative probabilistic models from a set of homologous protein sequences. These models are chosen from an exponential family with linear and quadratic interactions, commonly referred to as Potts models (see Eq 1) [6]. In the literature, this procedure has been motivated by maximum entropy arguments [7–10]. In this Perspective, I will point out that these arguments are mistaken and that the successes of DCA can have nothing to do with maximum entropy. To the contrary, maximum entropy hides the real nature and questions raised by DCA and is thus an obstacle to progress. In addition, maximum entropy has a long and contested history in statistical physics, the field in which it was first introduced [11,12]. Definite and precise results derived in the last decade and a half have here conclusively falsified maximum entropy. Appeals to maximum entropy are therefore prejudicial to a more general acceptance and adoption of DCA.",2016,2016-05-01 00:00:00,21.0,33.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10ab4835c2d9517f6f94086beb81cc07aa34a9b6

10.1093/nar/gkv1344,The Pfam protein families database: towards a more sustainable future,"In the last two years the Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org) has undergone a substantial reorganisation to reduce the effort involved in making a release, thereby permitting more frequent releases. Arguably the most significant of these changes is that Pfam is now primarily based on the UniProtKB reference proteomes, with the counts of matched sequences and species reported on the website restricted to this smaller set. Building families on reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the website, whilst still providing access to many important model organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however, still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB sequences can still be retrieved. Some Pfam entries (1.6%) which have no matches to reference proteomes remain; we are working with UniProt to see if sequences from them can be incorporated into reference proteomes. Pfam-B, the automatically-generated supplement to Pfam, has been removed. The current release (Pfam 29.0) includes 16 295 entries and 559 clans.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btu791,MetaPSICOV: combining coevolution methods for accurate prediction of contacts and long range hydrogen bonding in proteins,"Motivation: Recent developments of statistical techniques to infer direct evolutionary couplings between residue pairs have rendered covariation-based contact prediction a viable means for accurate 3D modelling of proteins, with no information other than the sequence required. To extend the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta-predictor (MetaPSICOV) which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence alignments, considers a broad range of other sequence-derived features and, uniquely, a range of metrics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues. Results: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range contacts—around 60% higher than PSICOV, and around 40% better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range hydrogen bonding, MetaPSICOV-HB achieves a precision of 0.69 for the top-L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 for the baseline MetaPSICOV.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003889,Improved Contact Predictions Using the Recognition of Protein Like Contact Patterns,"Given sufficient large protein families, and using a global statistical inference approach, it is possible to obtain sufficient accuracy in protein residue contact predictions to predict the structure of many proteins. However, these approaches do not consider the fact that the contacts in a protein are neither randomly, nor independently distributed, but actually follow precise rules governed by the structure of the protein and thus are interdependent. Here, we present PconsC2, a novel method that uses a deep learning approach to identify protein-like contact patterns to improve contact predictions. A substantial enhancement can be seen for all contacts independently on the number of aligned sequences, residue separation or secondary structure type, but is largest for β-sheet containing proteins. In addition to being superior to earlier methods based on statistical inferences, in comparison to state of the art methods using machine learning, PconsC2 is superior for families with more than 100 effective sequence homologs. The improved contact prediction enables improved structure prediction.",2014,2014-11-01 00:00:00,160.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf6ca4894bbae8803b7403822ff0350e0371fce4
10.1093/bioinformatics/btu500,CCMpred—fast and precise prediction of protein residue–residue contacts from correlated mutations,"Motivation: Recent breakthroughs in protein residue–residue contact prediction have made reliable de novo prediction of protein structures possible. The key was to apply statistical methods that can distinguish direct couplings between pairs of columns in a multiple sequence alignment from merely correlated pairs, i.e. to separate direct from indirect effects. Two classes of such methods exist, either relying on regularized inversion of the covariance matrix or on pseudo-likelihood maximization (PLM). Although PLM-based methods offer clearly higher precision, available tools are not sufficiently optimized and are written in interpreted languages that introduce additional overheads. This impedes the runtime and large-scale contact prediction for larger protein families, multi-domain proteins and protein–protein interactions. Results: Here we introduce CCMpred, our performance-optimized PLM implementation in C and CUDA C. Using graphics cards in the price range of current six-core processors, CCMpred can predict contacts for typical alignments 35–113 times faster and with the same precision as the most accurate published methods. For users without a CUDA-capable graphics card, CCMpred can also run in a CPU mode that is still 4–14 times faster. Thanks to our speed-ups (http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/speed-up) contacts for typical protein families can be predicted in 15–60 s on a consumer-grade GPU and 1–6 min on a six-core CPU.

10.3389/fphys.2022.870657,"Construction of an HLA Classifier for Early Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Recognition of Immunosuppression in Sepsis by Multiple Transcriptome Datasets","Background: Sepsis is a clinical syndrome, due to a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection. Accumulating evidence shows that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play a key role in the immune responses to sepsis. Nevertheless, the effects of HLA genes in sepsis have still not been comprehensively understood. Methods: A systematical search was performed in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases from inception to 10 September 2021. Random forest (RF) and modified Lasso penalized regression were conducted to identify hub genes in multi-transcriptome data, thus we constructed a prediction model, namely the HLA classifier. ArrayExpress databases, as external validation, were utilized to evaluate its diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive performance. Immune cell infiltration score was calculated via CIBERSORTx tools and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and ssGSEA were conducted to determine the pathways that are significantly enriched in different subgroups. Next, we systematically correlated the HLA classifier with immunological characteristics from multiple perspectives, such as immune-related cell infiltration, pivotal molecular pathways, and cytokine expression. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate the expression level of HLA genes in clinical samples. Results: A total of nine datasets comprising 1,251 patients were included. Based on RF and modified Lasso penalized regression in multi-transcriptome datasets, five HLA genes (B2M, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2) were identified as hub genes, which were used to construct an HLA classifier. In the discovery cohort, the HLA classifier exhibited superior diagnostic value (AUC = 0.997) and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.716) than clinical characteristics or endotypes. Encouragingly, similar results were observed in the ArrayExpress databases. In the E-MTAB-7581 dataset, the use of hydrocortisone in the HLA high-risk subgroup (OR: 2.84, 95% CI 1.07–7.57, p = 0.037) was associated with increased risk of mortality, but not in the HLA low-risk subgroup. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis by CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA revealed that B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and infiltrating lymphocytes (ILs) were significantly richer in HLA low-risk phenotypes, while Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were more abundant in HLA high-risk phenotypes. The HLA classifier was significantly negatively correlated with B cells, activated dendritic cells, NK cells, T helper cells, and ILs, yet was significantly positively correlated with Tregs and MDSCs. Subsequently, molecular pathways analysis uncovered that cytokine-cytokine receptor (CCR) interaction, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and antigen-presenting cell (APC) co-stimulation were significantly enriched in HLA low-risk endotypes, which was significantly negatively correlated with the HLA classifier in multi-transcriptome data. Finally, the expression levels of several cytokines (IL-10, IFNG, TNF) were significantly different between the HLA subgroups, and the ratio of IL-10/TNF was significantly positively correlated with HLA score in multi-transcriptome data. Results of qRT-PCR validated the higher expression level of B2M as well as lower expression level of HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, TAP1, and TAP2 in sepsis samples compared to control sample. Conclusion: Based on five HLA genes, a diagnostic and prognostic model, namely the HLA classifier, was established, which is closely correlated with responses to hydrocortisone and immunosuppression status and might facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",2022,2022-05-24 00:00:00,15.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca1c6603c34da30ed23d89a312a9906215a28b9b

Coagulation is a key component of innate immunity since it prevents bacterial dissemination and can provoke inflammation. The term immunothrombosis describes the process by which the innate immune response drives aberrant coagulation, which can result in a lethal condition termed disseminated intravascular coagulation, often seen in sepsis. In this review, we describe the recently uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying inflammasome‐ and STING‐driven immunothrombosis induced by bacterial and viral infections, culminating in tissue factor (TF) activation and release. Current anticoagulant therapeutics, while effective, are associated with a life‐threatening bleeding risk, requiring the urgent development of new treatments. Targeting immunothrombosis may provide a safer option. Thus, we highlight preclinical tools which target TF and/or block canonical (NLRP3) or noncanonical (caspase‐11) inflammasome activation as well as STING‐driven TF release and discuss clinically approved drugs which block key immunothrombotic processes and, therefore, may be redeployed as safer anticoagulants.",2022,2022-05-15 00:00:00,19.0,139.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c7e8de990aca1881ae30bcf3ae751152c787d42

10.3389/fimmu.2021.592303,Machine Learning Identifies Complicated Sepsis Course and Subsequent Mortality Based on 20 Genes in Peripheral Blood Immune Cells at 24 H Post-ICU Admission,"A complicated clinical course for critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) usually includes multiorgan dysfunction and subsequent death. Owing to the heterogeneity, complexity, and unpredictability of the disease progression, ICU patient care is challenging. Identifying the predictors of complicated courses and subsequent mortality at the early stages of the disease and recognizing the trajectory of the disease from the vast array of longitudinal quantitative clinical data is difficult. Therefore, we attempted to perform a meta-analysis of previously published gene expression datasets to identify novel early biomarkers and train the artificial intelligence systems to recognize the disease trajectories and subsequent clinical outcomes. Using the gene expression profile of peripheral blood cells obtained within 24 h of pediatric ICU (PICU) admission and numerous clinical data from 228 septic patients from pediatric ICU, we identified 20 differentially expressed genes predictive of complicated course outcomes and developed a new machine learning model. After 5-fold cross-validation with 10 iterations, the overall mean area under the curve reached 0.82. Using a subset of the same set of genes, we further achieved an overall area under the curve of 0.72, 0.96, 0.83, and 0.82, respectively, on four independent external validation sets. This model was highly effective in identifying the clinical trajectories of the patients and mortality. Artificial intelligence systems identified eight out of twenty novel genetic markers (SDC4, CLEC5A, TCN1, MS4A3, HCAR3, OLAH, PLCB1, and NLRP1) that help predict sepsis severity or mortality. While these genes have been previously associated with sepsis mortality, in this work, we show that these genes are also implicated in complex disease courses, even among survivors. The discovery of eight novel genetic biomarkers related to the overactive innate immune system, including neutrophil function, and a new predictive machine learning method provides options to effectively recognize sepsis trajectories, modify real-time treatment options, improve prognosis, and patient survival.",2021,2021-02-22 00:00:00,47.0,92.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d18290edc4c3b926387854da44e272bcf9b7f7a

The present study investigated the indirect effects of coping strategies in the association between perceived chronic stress and COVID-related conspiracy beliefs. We report data from an online survey (N = 1,354 individuals: 807 female; 508 male; 8 diverse; 6 not specified; mean age 39.14 years) in German-speaking countries collected between January and March 2021. Our results indicate that people who felt more stressed were more prone to conspiracy beliefs. Coping via acceptance and self-blame was associated with decreased tendencies towards COVID-related conspiracy beliefs, while people who used denial as a strategy were more prone to these beliefs. These findings emphasize the need for stress management interventions and effective coping strategies during times of crisis in order to reduce chronic perceived stress, promote adaptive coping, and ultimately reduce conspiracy beliefs.",2022,2022-08-16 00:00:00,12.0,35.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc9cc46e89a126915171e4cd894fa31090bd3788

However, the global evidence of mental health changes before compared to during the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on children and young people has not been systematically reviewed. This systematic review examined longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional studies comparing before and during COVID-19 pandemic data to determine whether the mental health of children and young people had changed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies that had been published in English and focused on children and young people between 0 and 24 years of age. This identified 21 studies from 11 countries, covering more than 96,000 subjects from 3 to 24 years of age. Pre-pandemic and pandemic data were compared. Most studies reported longitudinal deterioration in the mental health of adolescents and young people, with increased depression, anxiety and psychological distress after the pandemic started. Other findings included deteriorated negative affect, mental well-being and increased loneliness. Comparing data for pandemic and pre-pandemic periods showed that the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the mental health of children and young people. There is an urgent need for high-quality research to address the impact, risks and protective factors of the pandemic on their mental health, as this will provide a good foundation for dealing with future health emergencies and other crises.",2022,2022-08-12 00:00:00,301.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/704508dc887d6a124470ea40b5a9c97fb9280f69

This study assessed mental health in high school students 1.5 years after the pandemic began in Austria. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from September to November 2021. Well-being (WHO-5), depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep quality were assessed. A total of 1505 adolescents participated (78% girls). The cut-offs for clinically relevant symptoms were exceeded by 62% girls and 38.1% boys for depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 11), 49% girls and 29% boys for anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 11) and 28% girls and 17% boys for insomnia (ISI score ≥ 15). The prevalence of suicidal ideation (item 9 of the PHQ-9) within the last 2 weeks was 47% in girls and 32% in boys. These data collected in autumn 2021 (the start of the second semester of reopened schools; t2) were compared to data collected in February 2021 (one semester after remote schooling; t1). A matched pairs analysis according to age, gender, region, school type and migration background resulted in a total sample size of N  = 2514 adolescents. Results showed small deteriorations in mental health (i.e., well-being, depression, insomnia, suicidal ideation) in girls at t2 compared to t1, and an increase in suicidal thoughts in boys (all p -values < 0.05). Qualitative data show that young people have a need for more psychological support, both professional and informal, as well as increased mental health literacy.

10.3390/ijerph19159072,Association of Health Behaviors with Mental Health Problems in More than 7000 Adolescents during COVID-19,"Previous studies show detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on the lives of adolescents. Adolescents have experienced disruption in their daily routines, including changes in health behaviors such as an increased sedentary behavior and increased smartphone usage. The aim of this study was to assess the association of health behaviors with mental health problems in Austrian adolescents during the pandemic. Five cross-sectional surveys (February 2021 to May 2022) were performed during the pandemic assessing physical activity, smartphone usage, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), sleep quality (ISI-7), and stress (PSS-10). In total, N = 7201 adolescents (age: 14–20 years ((MW±SD): 16.63 ± 1.49 years); 70.2% female, 18.8% migration background) participated. A strong increase in mobile phone usage as well as a decrease in physical activity as compared to pre-pandemic data were observed (p < 0.001). Compared to the lowest smartphone user group (<1 h/d), the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for all investigated mental health symptoms increased with increasing smartphone usage up to 3.2–6.8 in high-utilizers (>8 h/d). The aORs for depressive, anxiety, insomnia, and stress symptoms decreased in physically active compared to inactive adolescents.

10.3389/fpsyt.2022.870128,Conspiratorial Beliefs About COVID-19 Pandemic - Can They Pose a Mental Health Risk? The Relationship Between Conspiracy Thinking and the Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Adult Poles,"The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic, tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms among the surveyed Poles. The study was conducted via the Internet in a group of 700 people aged 24.8 ± 6.3 years (mean ± SD). 585 females and 110 males were involved. Scales such as Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the original questionnaire COVID-19 Conspiratorial Beliefs Scale (COVID-19 CBS) designed to measure the tendency to believe in false information about COVID-19 pandemic were used. A positive correlation was observed between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 CBS) and the tendency to believe in general conspiracy theories (GCBS) (r = 0.768; p < 0.001). Moreover, both COVID-19 CBS and GCBS positively correlated with the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study group. For COVID-19 CBS, the correlation coefficients were 0.087 (p < 0.021) and.108 (p < 0.004) for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, while for GCBS the coefficients were 0.132 (p < 0.001) and 0.147 (p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the increased tendency to believe in false beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in the severity of anxiety (b = 0.04; p = 0.021) and depression (b = 0.06; p < 0.001) symptoms. It can be hypothesized that the tendency to believe in false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is positively associated with the tendency to general belief in conspiracy theories.

A Cross-Sectional Multicenter Study,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to have impaired the mental health and well-being of young people. This study, for the first time, explores these aspects in young people with and without a migratory background during the extended course of the pandemic and restrictive measures, comparing two countries with a high COVID-19 prevalence: Austria and Turkey. Methods: The authors used the “Psychological General Well-being” index as part of an anonymous online survey with 3665 participants (ages 15–25), recruited from both countries during the first and the second waves of the pandemic, collecting data on individual experiences and problems encountered during the pandemic. Results: Mental health (b = 0.06, p < 0.023) and general psychological well-being worsened with the progression of the pandemic. Participants with financial problems had the most severe negative effect on mental health (b = 0.12, p < 0.001). Furthermore, females living in Turkey, both natives (b = −0.21, p < 0.001) and migrants (b = 0.25, p < 0.001), reported a more deteriorated mental health status over time.

10.1613/jair.816,An Analysis of Reduced Error Pruning,"Top-down induction of decision trees has been observed to suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase. In particular, it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows linearly with the sample size, even though the accuracy of the tree does not improve. Reduced Error Pruning is an algorithm that has been used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems of decision tree learning. 
 
In this paper we present analyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three different settings. First we study the basic algorithmic properties of the method, properties that hold independent of the input decision tree and pruning examples. Then we examine a situation that intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be replaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute values of the pruning examples are independent of each other. This analysis is conducted under two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis we assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This assumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do not receive any pruning examples. 
 
This paper clarifies the different variants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its algorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis.",2001,2001-07-01 00:00:00,125.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01bf75c26b238aea72231f9224f6dbff450c0e7e
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106873,Multi-Source Multi-Domain Data Fusion for Cyberattack Detection in Power Systems,"Modern power systems equipped with advanced communication infrastructure are cyber-physical in nature. The traditional approach of leveraging physical measurements for detecting cyber-induced physical contingencies is insufficient to reflect the accurate cyber-physical states. Moreover, deploying conventional rule-based and anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for cyberattack detection results in higher false positives. Hence, independent usage of detection tools of cyberattacks in cyber and physical sides has a limited capability. In this work, a mechanism to fuse real-time data from cyber and physical domains, to improve situational awareness of the whole system is developed. It is demonstrated how improved situational awareness can help reduce false positives in intrusion detection. This cyber and physical data fusion results in cyber-physical state space explosion which is addressed using different feature transformation and selection techniques. Our fusion engine is further integrated into a cyber-physical power system testbed as an application that collects cyber and power system telemetry from multiple sensors emulating real-world data sources found in a utility. These are synthesized into features for algorithms to detect cyber intrusions. Results are presented using the proposed data fusion application to infer False Data and Command Injection (FDI and FCI)-based Man-in-The-Middle attacks. Post collection, the data fusion application uses time-synchronized merge and extracts features. This is followed by pre-processing such as imputation, categorical encoding, and feature reduction, before training supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning models to evaluate the performance of the intrusion detection system. A major finding is the improvement of detection accuracy by fusion of features from cyber, security, and physical domains. Additionally, it is observed that the semi-supervised co-training technique performs at par with supervised learning methods with the proposed feature vector. The approach and toolset, as well as the dataset that is generated can be utilized to prevent threats such as false data or command injection attacks from being carried out by identifying cyber intrusions accurately.",2021,2021-01-18 00:00:00,63.0,105.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02316c3515bd5e98a78a1b87554196c08fbdedcc

The major challenge to analyze gene expression data, with a large number of genes and small samples, is to extract disease-related information from a massive amount of redundant data and noise. Gene selection, eliminating redundant and irrelevant genes, has been a key step to address this problem. The modified method was tested on four benchmark datasets with either two-class phenotypes or multiclass phenotypes, outperforming previous methods, with relatively higher accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate and reduced runtime.

We make predictions of solution free energy using physics-based theory alone and using machine learning/quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) models. We also develop machine learning models where the theoretical energies and cheminformatics descriptors are used as combined input. These models are used to predict solvation free energy. While direct theoretical calculation does not give accurate results in this approach, machine learning is able to give predictions with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼1.1 log S units in a 10-fold cross-validation for our Drug-Like-Solubility-100 (DLS-100) dataset of 100 druglike molecules. We find that a model built using energy terms from our theoretical methodology as descriptors is marginally less predictive than one built on Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) descriptors. Combining both sets of descriptors allows a further but very modest improvement in the predictions. However, in some cases, this is a statistically significant enhancement. These results suggest that there is little complementarity between the chemical information provided by these two sets of descriptors, despite their different sources and methods of calculation.

10.1038/s41597-023-02153-8,"PTB-XL+, a comprehensive electrocardiographic feature dataset","Machine learning (ML) methods for the analysis of electrocardiography (ECG) data are gaining importance, substantially supported by the release of large public datasets. However, these current datasets miss important derived descriptors such as ECG features that have been devised in the past hundred years and still form the basis of most automatic ECG analysis algorithms and are critical for cardiologists’ decision processes. ECG features are available from sophisticated commercial software but are not accessible to the general public. To alleviate this issue, we add ECG features from two leading commercial algorithms and an open-source implementation supplemented by a set of automatic diagnostic statements from a commercial ECG analysis software in preprocessed format. This allows the comparison of ML models trained on clinically versus automatically generated label sets. We provide an extensive technical validation of features and diagnostic statements for ML applications. We believe this release crucially enhances the usability of the PTB-XL dataset as a reference dataset for ML methods in the context of ECG data.",2023,2023-05-13 00:00:00,37.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28a8b3984157639a1c7ed37085e059b8a86e6bcc
10.1515/cdbme-2022-1026,A Large-scale Virtual Patient Cohort to Study ECG Features of Interatrial Conduction Block,"Abstract Interatrial conduction block refers to a disturbance in the propagation of electrical impulses in the conduction pathways between the right and the left atrium. It is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, stroke, and premature death. Clinical diagnostic criteria comprise an increased P wave duration and biphasic P waves in lead II, III and aVF due to retrograde activation of the left atrium. Machine learning algorithms could improve the diagnosis but require a large-scale, well-controlled and balanced dataset. In silico electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, optimally obtained from a statistical shape model to cover anatomical variability, carry the potential to produce an extensive database meeting the requirements for successful machine learning application. We generated the first in silico dataset including interatrial conduction block of 9,800 simulated ECG signals based on a bi-atrial statistical shape model. Automated feature analysis was performed to evaluate P wave morphology, duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1. Increased P wave duration and P wave terminal force in lead V1 were found for models with interatrial conduction block compared to healthy models. A wide variability of P wave morphology was detected for models with interatrial conduction block. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results suggest that a biphasic P wave morphology seems to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of interatrial conduction block. The presented dataset is ready for a classification with machine learning algorithms and can be easily extended.",2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,2.0,12.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62565b9a3c11dcc0899cdd3ed9527106f7f5e1de
10.1101/2022.02.13.22270835,AugmentA: Patient-specific Augmented Atrial model Generation Tool,"Digital twins of patients' hearts are a promising tool to assess arrhythmia vulnerability and to personalize therapy. However, the process of building personalized computational models can be challenging and requires a high level of human interaction. A pipeline to standardize the generation of a patient's atrial digital twin from clinical data is therefore desirable. We propose a patient-specific Augmented Atria generation pipeline (AugmentA) as a highly automated framework which, starting from clinical geometrical data, provides ready-to-use atrial personalized computational models. AugmentA consists firstly of a pre-processing step applied to the input geometry. Secondly, the atrial orifices are identified and labelled using only one reference point per atrium. If the user chooses to fit a statistical shape model (SSM) to the input geometry, it is first rigidly aligned with the given mean shape before a non-rigid fitting procedure is applied. AugmentA automatically generates the fiber orientation and finds local conduction velocities by minimizing the error between the simulated and clinical local activation time (LAT) map. The pipeline was tested on a cohort of 29 patients on both segmented magnetic resonance images (MRI) and electroanatomical maps of the left atrium. Moreover, the pipeline was applied to a bi-atrial volumetric mesh derived from MRI. The pipeline robustly integrated fiber orientation and anatomical region annotations in 38.4+-5.7 s. The error between in-silico and clinical LAT maps was on average 12.7 ms. In conclusion, AugmentA offers an automated and comprehensive pipeline delivering atrial digital twins from clinical data in procedural time.",2022,2022-02-15 00:00:00,27.0,59.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63f36f814fffbb5582b67bfc6a54ec747952a4cf
10.1093/europace/euab322,Hybrid machine learning to localize atrial flutter substrates using the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram,"Abstract Aims Atrial flutter (AFlut) is a common re-entrant atrial tachycardia driven by self-sustainable mechanisms that cause excitations to propagate along pathways different from sinus rhythm. Intra-cardiac electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation are often performed without detailed prior knowledge of the mechanism perpetuating AFlut, likely prolonging the procedure time of these invasive interventions. We sought to discriminate the AFlut location [cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent (CTI), peri-mitral, and other left atrium (LA) AFlut classes] with a machine learning-based algorithm using only the non-invasive signals from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Methods and results Hybrid 12-lead ECG dataset of 1769 signals was used (1424 in silico ECGs, and 345 clinical ECGs from 115 patients—three different ECG segments over time were extracted from each patient corresponding to single AFlut cycles). Seventy-seven features were extracted. A decision tree classifier with a hold-out classification approach was trained, validated, and tested on the dataset randomly split after selecting the most informative features. The clinical test set comprised 38 patients (114 clinical ECGs). The classifier yielded 76.3% accuracy on the clinical test set with a sensitivity of 89.7%, 75.0%, and 64.1% and a positive predictive value of 71.4%, 75.0%, and 86.2% for CTI, peri-mitral, and other LA class, respectively. Considering majority vote of the three segments taken from each patient, the CTI class was correctly classified at 92%. Conclusion Our results show that a machine learning classifier relying only on non-invasive signals can potentially identify the location of AFlut mechanisms. This method could aid in planning and tailoring patient-specific AFlut treatments.",2022,2022-01-19 00:00:00,11.0,21.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0a87bbced4640c6a3a72ae67009a592043a6151
10.1515/cdbme-2021-2035,An automate pipeline for generating fiber orientation and region annotation in patient specific atrial models,"Abstract Modeling the 'digital twin' of a patient's heart has gained traction in the last years and helps to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of cardiovascular disease to pave the way for personalized therapies. Although a 3D patient-specific model (PSM) can be obtained from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the fiber orientation of cardiac muscle, which significantly affects the electrophysiological and mechanical characteristics of the heart, can hardly be obtained in vivo. Several approaches have been suggested to solve this problem. However, most of them require a considerable amount of human interaction, which is both time-consuming and a potential source of error. In this work, a highly automated pipeline based on a Laplace- Dirichlet-rule-based method (LDRBM) for annotating fibers and anatomical regions in both atria is introduced. The calculated fiber arrangement was regionally compared with anatomical observations from literature and faithfully reproduced clinical and experimental data.",2021,2021-10-01 00:00:00,11.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fcadbaa5e5be26fab8c4da9f295cba4cbe1df076
10.1007/s10439-021-02825-9,Automated Framework for the Inclusion of a His–Purkinje System in Cardiac Digital Twins of Ventricular Electrophysiology,"Personalized models of cardiac electrophysiology (EP) that match clinical observation with high fidelity, referred to as cardiac digital twins (CDTs), show promise as a tool for tailoring cardiac precision therapies. Building CDTs of cardiac EP relies on the ability of models to replicate the ventricular activation sequence under a broad range of conditions. Of pivotal importance is the His–Purkinje system (HPS) within the ventricles. Workflows for the generation and incorporation of HPS models are needed for use in cardiac digital twinning pipelines that aim to minimize the misfit between model predictions and clinical data such as the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG). We thus develop an automated two stage approach for HPS personalization. A fascicular-based model is first introduced that modulates the endocardial Purkinje network. Only emergent features of sites of earliest activation within the ventricular myocardium and a fast-conducting sub-endocardial layer are accounted for. It is then replaced by a topologically realistic Purkinje-based representation of the HPS. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated. Equivalence between both HPS model representations is investigated by comparing activation patterns and 12 lead ECGs under both sinus rhythm and right-ventricular apical pacing. Predominant ECG morphology is preserved by both HPS models under sinus conditions, but elucidates differences during pacing.",2021,2021-08-24 00:00:00,41.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aad057f0136ea159b619d3629571f1697dfb83dd
10.3390/hearts2030028,Computer Modeling of the Heart for ECG Interpretation—A Review,"Computer modeling of the electrophysiology of the heart has undergone significant progress. A healthy heart can be modeled starting from the ion channels via the spread of a depolarization wave on a realistic geometry of the human heart up to the potentials on the body surface and the ECG. Research is advancing regarding modeling diseases of the heart. This article reviews progress in calculating and analyzing the corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) from simulated depolarization and repolarization waves. First, we describe modeling of the P-wave, the QRS complex and the T-wave of a healthy heart. Then, both the modeling and the corresponding ECGs of several important diseases and arrhythmias are delineated: ischemia and infarction, ectopic beats and extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia, bundle branch blocks, atrial tachycardia, flutter and fibrillation, genetic diseases and channelopathies, imbalance of electrolytes and drug-induced changes. Finally, we outline the potential impact of computer modeling on ECG interpretation. Computer modeling can contribute to a better comprehension of the relation between features in the ECG and the underlying cardiac condition and disease. It can pave the way for a quantitative analysis of the ECG and can support the cardiologist in identifying events or non-invasively localizing diseased areas. Finally, it can deliver very large databases of reliably labeled ECGs as training data for machine learning.",2021,2021-07-26 00:00:00,20.0,122.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f65eb351164b9e961a2e3d4b8b0120097c9d3ac6

Here, we present the openCARP simulation environment as one solution that could foster the needs of large parts of this community. Methods and Results openCARP and the Python-based carputils framework allow developing and sharing simulation pipelines which automate in silico experiments including all modeling and simulation steps to increase reproducibility and productivity. The continuously expanding openCARP user community is supported by tailored infrastructure. Documentation and training material facilitate access to this complementary research tool for new users. After a brief historic review, this paper summarizes requirements for a high-usability electrophysiology simulator and describes how openCARP fulfills them. We introduce the openCARP modeling workflow in a multi-scale example of atrial fibrillation simulations on single cell, tissue, organ and body level and finally outline future development potential. Conclusion As an open simulator, openCARP can advance the computational cardiac electrophysiology field by making state-of-the-art simulations accessible.

Previous work (the “DeepTop” tagger of Kasieczka et al) has shown that a CNN-based top tagger can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art conventional top taggers based on high-level inputs. Here, we introduce a number of improvements to the DeepTop tagger, including architecture, training, image preprocessing, sample size and color pixels. Our final CNN top tagger outperforms BDTs based on high-level inputs by a factor of ∼ 2-3 or more in background rejection, over a wide range of tagging efficiencies and fiducial jet selections. As reference points, we achieve a QCD background rejection factor of 500 (60) at 50% top tagging efficiency for fully-merged (non-merged) top jets with pT in the 800-900 GeV (350-450 GeV) range.

In particle physics, this challenge is surmounted by the use of simulations. These simulations accurately reproduce most features of data, but cannot be trusted to capture all of the complex correlations exploitable by modern machine learning methods. Recent work in weakly supervised learning has shown that simple, low-dimensional classifiers can be trained using only the impure mixtures present in data. Here, we demonstrate that complex, high-dimensional classifiers can also be trained on impure mixtures using weak supervision techniques, with performance comparable to what could be achieved with pure samples. Using weak supervision will therefore allow us to avoid relying exclusively on simulations for high-dimensional classification.

However, its relation with other CV risk evaluation tools in T1D has not been elucidated yet. This study aimed to evaluate arterial stiffness in T1D patients free from known CVD, and compare it to other CV risk evaluation tools used in T1D. Methods Cross-sectional study in adults with a T1D duration of at least 10 years and without established CVD. Patients were categorized in CVD risk groups based on 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines , and the STENO T1D risk engine was used to estimate 10-year risk for CV events. Arterial stiffness was evaluated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score was assessed and carotid ultrasound was performed. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and central hemodynamic parameters were evaluated. Data on renal function and diabetic kidney disease was retrieved. Results 54 patients (age: 46 ± 9.5 years; T1D duration: 27 ± 8.8 years) were included. One-fourth of patients showed prematurely increased aortic stiffness based on cf-PWV (24%). Cf-PWV was significantly associated with CAC score, carotid intima-media thickness, central hemodynamic parameters and diabetic kidney disease. Based on STENO, 20 patients (37%) were at low, 20 patients (37%) at moderate, and 14 patients (26%) at high 10-year risk for CV event. Cf-PWV was strongly associated with the STENO score (r s  = + 0.81; R 2  = 0.566, p < 0.001), increasing with each higher STENO group (p < 0.01). However, cf-PWV was not significantly different between the two CV risk groups (high versus very high) based on ESC criteria, and ESC criteria compared to STENO classified 10 patients more as having > 10% 10-year risk for CV events (n = 44/54; 81.5% versus n = 34/54; 63%). Conclusions This study demonstrated that a substantial proportion of long-standing T1D patients free from known CVD show premature arterial stiffening. Cf-PWV strongly associates with the STENO risk score for future CV events and with cardiovascular imaging and function outcomes, thereby illustrating the clinical importance of arterial stiffness. The data, however, also show considerable heterogeneity in CV risk and differences in risk categorisation between the STENO tool and ESC criteria.There is a need for refinement of CV risk classification in T1D, and future studies should investigate if evaluation of arterial stiffness should be implemented in T1D clinical practice and which patients benefit the most from its assessment.",2022,2022-06-09 00:00:00,11.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5bf5bf7da44b82a3ad16ff4de6e49fcb8344f02b

Methods We retrospectively collected electronic medical records of enrolled patients from the data warehouse of China Medical University Hospital, a tertiary medical center in central Taiwan, from January 2012 to November 2018. We included patients who underwent a documented carotid ultrasound within 30 days of experiencing an acute first stroke during the study period. We classified these participants into two groups: those with non-recurrent stroke (those who has not been diagnosed with acute stroke again during the study period) and those with recurrent stoke (those who has been diagnosed with acute stroke during the study period). A total of 1,235 carotid sonographic parameters were analyzed. Data on the patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities were also collected. Python 3.7 was used as the programming language, and the scikit-learn toolkit was used to complete the derivation and verification of the machine learning methods. Results In total, 2,411 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 1,896 and 515 had non-recurrent and recurrent stroke, respectively. After extraction, 43 features of carotid sonography (36 carotid sonographic parameters and seven transcranial color Doppler sonographic parameter) were analyzed. For predicting recurrent stroke, CatBoost achieved the highest area under the curve (0.844, CIs 95% 0.824–0.868), followed by the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (0.832, CIs 95% 0.813–0.851), random forest (0.819, CIs 95% 0.802–0.846), support-vector machine (0.759, CIs 95% 0.739–0.781), logistic regression (0.781, CIs 95% 0.764–0.800), and decision tree (0.735, CIs 95% 0.717–0.755) models. Conclusion When using the CatBoost model, the top three features for predicting recurrent stroke were determined to be the use of anticoagulation medications, the use of NSAID medications, and the resistive index of the left subclavian artery.

Methods: The cardiometabolic risk profile was defined based on the Adult Treatment Panel III panel. Carotid intimal media thickness (cIMT) and arterial stiffness were assessed using high-resolution ultrasonography. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to estimate the association between FM and cardiometabolic risk factors. We used a general linear regression to compare the cIMT and carotid beta-index between the participants with and without FM. Pearson’s coefficient was calculated to evaluate the potential correlation between cardiometabolic risk profiles, cIMT, and arterial stiffening in FM. Results: FM participants showed a higher risk of central obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49, 6.91), high triglyceride (OR = 4.73, 95% CI 2.29, 9.79), and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (OR = 4.27, 95% CI 2.07, 8.81) compared to the control group. The FM group exhibited higher beta-index values than the control group (p = 0.003). Although IFG and triglyceride glucose index showed a tendency to correlate with the beta-index, statistical significance was not observed. Conclusions: FM was associated with an increased risk of central obesity, high triglyceride levels, and IFG.

Methods Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination were used for feature selection. Four machine learning algorithms were used to construct a prediction model, and their performance was compared based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric in a discovery dataset (n = 760). The model with the best performance was selected and validated in an independent dataset (n = 912) from the Dryad Digital Repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m484p). To apply our model to clinical practice, we built a free and user-friendly web online tool. Results The predictive model includes the predictors: age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index. In the discovery cohort, the gradient boosting-based model outperformed other methods in the elevated arterial stiffness prediction. In the validation cohort, the gradient boosting model showed a good discrimination capacity. A cutoff value of 0.46 for the elevated arterial stiffness risk score in the gradient boosting model resulted in a good specificity (0.813 in the discovery data and 0.761 in the validation data) and sensitivity (0.875 and 0.738, respectively) trade-off points. Conclusion The gradient boosting-based prediction system presents a good classification in elevated arterial stiffness prediction. The web online tool makes our gradient boosting-based model easily accessible for further clinical studies and utilization.",2021,2021-08-23 00:00:00,8.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c877011c08d73c6442e2683d4e3a5d240afc9ed
10.1155/2021/5594899,Improvement of Support Vector Machine Algorithm in Big Data Background,"With the rapid development of the Internet and the rapid development of big data analysis technology, data mining has played a positive role in promoting industry and academia. Classification is an important problem in data mining. This paper explores the background and theory of support vector machines (SVM) in data mining classification algorithms and analyzes and summarizes the research status of various improved methods of SVM. According to the scale and characteristics of the data, different solution spaces are selected, and the solution of the dual problem is transformed into the classification surface of the original space to improve the algorithm speed. Research Process. Incorporating fuzzy membership into multicore learning, it is found that the time complexity of the original problem is determined by the dimension, and the time complexity of the dual problem is determined by the quantity, and the dimension and quantity constitute the scale of the data, so it can be based on the scale of the data Features Choose different solution spaces. The algorithm speed can be improved by transforming the solution of the dual problem into the classification surface of the original space. Conclusion. By improving the calculation rate of traditional machine learning algorithms, it is concluded that the accuracy of the fitting prediction between the predicted data and the actual value is as high as 98%, which can make the traditional machine learning algorithm meet the requirements of the big data era. It can be widely used in the context of big data.",2021,2021-06-17 00:00:00,111.0,26.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c2a93dee0ec90facf6f1424e0e39fb3ed1c82aa

10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-222370,Interferon-α-mediated therapeutic resistance in early rheumatoid arthritis implicates epigenetic reprogramming,"Objectives An interferon (IFN) gene signature (IGS) is present in approximately 50% of early, treatment naive rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) patients where it has been shown to negatively impact initial response to treatment. We wished to validate this effect and explore potential mechanisms of action. Methods In a multicentre inception cohort of eRA patients (n=191), we examined the whole blood IGS (MxA, IFI44L, OAS1, IFI6, ISG15) with reference to circulating IFN proteins, clinical outcomes and epigenetic influences on circulating CD19+ B and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Results We reproduced our previous findings demonstrating a raised baseline IGS. We additionally showed, for the first time, that the IGS in eRA reflects circulating IFN-α protein. Paired longitudinal analysis demonstrated a significant reduction between baseline and 6-month IGS and IFN-α levels (p<0.0001 for both). Despite this fall, a raised baseline IGS predicted worse 6-month clinical outcomes such as increased disease activity score (DAS-28, p=0.025) and lower likelihood of a good EULAR clinical response (p=0.034), which was independent of other conventional predictors of disease activity and clinical response. Molecular analysis of CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells demonstrated differentially methylated CPG sites and dysregulated expression of disease relevant genes, including PARP9, STAT1, and EPSTI1, associated with baseline IGS/IFNα levels. Differentially methylated CPG sites implicated altered transcription factor binding in B cells (GATA3, ETSI, NFATC2, EZH2) and T cells (p300, HIF1α). Conclusions Our data suggest that, in eRA, IFN-α can cause a sustained, epigenetically mediated, pathogenic increase in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and that the IGS is, therefore, a robust prognostic biomarker. Its persistent harmful effects provide a rationale for the initial therapeutic targeting of IFN-α in selected patients with eRA.",2022,2022-06-09 00:00:00,27.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3bc9b4799545d7211d53539705206db2d7b2672
10.1038/s41591-022-01789-0,Rituximab versus tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: synovial biopsy-based biomarker analysis of the phase 4 R4RA randomized trial,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receive highly targeted biologic therapies without previous knowledge of target expression levels in the diseased tissue. Approximately 40% of patients do not respond to individual biologic therapies and 5–20% are refractory to all. In a biopsy-based, precision-medicine, randomized clinical trial in RA (R4RA; n = 164), patients with low/absent synovial B cell molecular signature had a lower response to rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) compared with that to tocilizumab (anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody) although the exact mechanisms of response/nonresponse remain to be established. Here, in-depth histological/molecular analyses of R4RA synovial biopsies identify humoral immune response gene signatures associated with response to rituximab and tocilizumab, and a stromal/fibroblast signature in patients refractory to all medications. Post-treatment changes in synovial gene expression and cell infiltration highlighted divergent effects of rituximab and tocilizumab relating to differing response/nonresponse mechanisms. Using ten-by-tenfold nested cross-validation, we developed machine learning algorithms predictive of response to rituximab (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74), tocilizumab (AUC = 0.68) and, notably, multidrug resistance (AUC = 0.69). This study supports the notion that disease endotypes, driven by diverse molecular pathology pathways in the diseased tissue, determine diverse clinical and treatment–response phenotypes. It also highlights the importance of integration of molecular pathology signatures into clinical algorithms to optimize the future use of existing medications and inform the development of new drugs for refractory patients. Biomarker analysis of the phase 4 R4RA trial identifies pretreatment synovial biopsy features selectively associated with response to rituximab or tocilizumab, and leads to the development of models that might predict treatment benefit in patients with rheumatoid arthritis",2022,2022-05-19 00:00:00,148.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e6b6b733090af6925f0a2b5389b053ef051d9a6

Monocytes (MOs) and macrophages, largely associated with arthritis, are contributors and sensors of inflammation through epigenetic modifications. In this study, we investigated associations between clinical features and DNA methylation in blood and synovial fluid (SF) MOs in a prospective cohort of patients with early inflammatory arthritis. DNA methylation profiles of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) blood MOs exhibited marked alterations in comparison with those from healthy donors. We identified additional differences both in blood and SF MOs after comparing patients with UA grouped by their future outcomes, i.e., good versus poor. Patient profiles in subsequent visits revealed a reversion toward a healthy level in both groups, those requiring disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and those who remitted spontaneously. Changes in disease activity between visits also affected DNA methylation, which was partially concomitant in the SF of UA and in blood MOs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Epigenetic similarities between arthritis types allow a common prediction of disease activity. Our results constitute a resource of DNA methylation–based biomarkers of poor prognosis, disease activity, and treatment efficacy for the personalized clinical management of early inflammatory arthritis.",2022,2022-03-24 00:00:00,12.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/639926891e3f96e6adce443d5a4944cdd09ae22f

Methods 144 consecutive treatment-naïve early RA patients (<12 months symptoms duration) underwent ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy before and 6 months after disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) initiation. Synovial biopsies were analysed for cellular (immunohistology) and molecular (NanoString) characteristics and results compared with clinical and imaging outcomes. Differential gene expression analysis and logistic regression were applied to define variables correlating with treatment response and predicting radiographic progression. Results Cellular and molecular analyses of synovial tissue demonstrated for the first time in early RA the presence of three pathology groups: (1) lympho-myeloid dominated by the presence of B cells in addition to myeloid cells; (2) d iffuse-myeloid with myeloid lineage predominance but poor in B cells nd (3) pauci-immune characterised by scanty immune cells and prevalent stromal cells. Longitudinal correlation of molecular signatures demonstrated that elevation of myeloid- and lymphoid-associated gene expression strongly correlated with disease activity, acute phase reactants and DMARD response at 6 months. Furthermore, elevation of synovial lymphoid-associated genes correlated with autoantibody positivity and elevation of osteoclast-targeting genes predicting radiographic joint damage progression at 12 months. Patients with predominant pauci-immune pathology showed less severe disease activity and radiographic progression. Conclusions We demonstrate at disease presentation, prior to pathology modulation by therapy, the presence of specific cellular/molecular synovial signatures that delineate disease severity/progression and therapeutic response and may pave the way to more precise definition of RA taxonomy, therapeutic targeting and improved outcomes.",2019,2019-03-16 00:00:00,236.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/431f8c4eb882a89cdadd46a8c9ac378f8026402b

This potential is encapsulated by the concept of a quantum advantage, which is contingent on a reduction in the consumption of a computational resource, such as time, space or data. Here, we distill the concept of a quantum advantage into a simple framework to aid researchers in biology and medicine pursuing the development of quantum applications. We then apply this framework to a wide variety of computational problems relevant to these domains in an effort to (i) assess the potential of practical advantages in specific application areas and (ii) identify gaps that may be addressed with novel quantum approaches. In doing so, we provide an extensive survey of the intersection of biology and medicine with the current landscape of quantum algorithms and their potential advantages. While we endeavour to identify specific computational problems that may admit practical advantages throughout this work, the rapid pace of change in the fields of quantum computing, classical algorithms and biological research implies that this intersection will remain highly dynamic for the foreseeable future.",2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,49.0,466.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/718924aaa37a9af821f521930e1055c0290d74ef

However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits. Expectations for quantum machine learning are high, but there is currently a lack of rigorous results on which scenarios would actually exhibit a quantum advantage.

10.3390/s23031315,Development of a Machine-Learning Intrusion Detection System and Testing of Its Performance Using a Generative Adversarial Network,"Intrusion detection and prevention are two of the most important issues to solve in network security infrastructure. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) protect networks by using patterns to detect malicious traffic. As attackers have tried to dissimulate traffic in order to evade the rules applied, several machine learning-based IDSs have been developed. In this study, we focused on one such model involving several algorithms and used the NSL-KDD dataset as a benchmark to train and evaluate its performance. We demonstrate a way to create adversarial instances of network traffic that can be used to evade detection by a machine learning-based IDS. Moreover, this traffic can be used for training in order to improve performance in the case of new attacks. Thus, a generative adversarial network (GAN)—i.e., an architecture based on a deep-learning algorithm capable of creating generative models—was implemented. Furthermore, we tested the IDS performance using the generated adversarial traffic.

In this paper, we propose an MCTS-T algorithm for generating adversarial examples of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The MCTS algorithm enables the generation model to provide a reward value that reflects the probability of generative examples bypassing the detector. To guarantee the antagonism and feasibility of the generative adversarial examples, the bypassing rules are restricted. The experimental results indicate that the missed detection rate of adversarial examples is significantly improved after the MCTS-T generation algorithm. Additionally, we construct a generative adversarial network (GAN) to optimize the detector and improve the detection rate when dealing with adversarial examples.

10.3390/app9204221,AE-CGAN Model based High Performance Network Intrusion Detection System,"In this paper, a high-performance network intrusion detection system based on deep learning is proposed for situations in which there are significant imbalances between normal and abnormal traffic. Based on the unsupervised learning models autoencoder (AE) and the generative adversarial networks (GAN) model during deep learning, the study aim is to solve the imbalance of data and intrusion detection of high performance. The AE-CGAN (autoencoder-conditional GAN) model is proposed to improve the performance of intrusion detection. This model oversamples rare classes based on the GAN model in order to solve the performance degradation caused by data imbalance after processing the characteristics of the data to a lower level using the autoencoder model. To measure the performance of the AE-CGAN model, data is classified using random forest (RF), a typical machine learning classification algorithm. In this experiment, we used the canadian institute for cybersecurity intrusion detection system (CICIDS)2017 dataset, the latest public dataset of network intrusion detection system (NIDS), and compared the three models to confirm efficacy of the proposed model. We compared the performance of three types of models. These included single-RF, a classification model using only a classification algorithm, AE-RF which is processed by classifying data features, and the AE-CGAN model which is classified after solving the data feature processing and data imbalance. Experimental results showed that the performance of the AE-CGAN model proposed in this paper was the highest. In particular, when the data were unbalanced, the performances of recall and F1 score, which are more accurate performance indicators, were 93.29% and 95.38%, respectively. The AE-CGAN model showed much better performance.",2019,2019-10-10 00:00:00,47.0,30.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/875634a8eed00a679ee2db9dd6475e19912b124b
10.3390/ELECTRONICS8030322,Features Dimensionality Reduction Approaches for Machine Learning Based Network Intrusion Detection,"The security of networked systems has become a critical universal issue that influences individuals, enterprises and governments. The rate of attacks against networked systems has increased dramatically, and the tactics used by the attackers are continuing to evolve. Intrusion detection is one of the solutions against these attacks. A common and effective approach for designing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is Machine Learning. The performance of an IDS is significantly improved when the features are more discriminative and representative. This study uses two feature dimensionality reduction approaches: (i) Auto-Encoder (AE): an instance of deep learning, for dimensionality reduction, and (ii) Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting low-dimensional features from both techniques are then used to build various classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Network, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for designing an IDS. The experimental findings with low-dimensional features in binary and multi-class classification show better performance in terms of Detection Rate (DR), F-Measure, False Alarm Rate (FAR), and Accuracy. This research effort is able to reduce the CICIDS2017 dataset’s feature dimensions from 81 to 10, while maintaining a high accuracy of 99.6% in multi-class and binary classification. Furthermore, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Class Combined performance metric C o m b i n e d M c with respect to class distribution to compare various multi-class and binary classification systems through incorporating FAR, DR, Accuracy, and class distribution parameters. In addition, we developed a uniform distribution based balancing approach to handle the imbalanced distribution of the minority class instances in the CICIDS2017 network intrusion dataset.",2019,2019-03-14 00:00:00,223.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c90d106f940e100285c55ce7444d4929853f464

Optimizing the standard digital back propagation (DBP) as a deep neural network (DNN) with interleaving linear and nonlinear operations for fiber nonlinearity compensation was shown to improve transmission performance in idealized simulation environments. Here, we extend such concepts to practical single-channel and polarization division multiplexed wavelength division multiplexed experiments. We show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art DSP algorithms and additionally, the optimized DNN-based DBP parameters exhibit a mathematical structure which guides us to further analyze the noise statistics of fiber nonlinearity compensation. This machine learning-inspired analysis reveals that ASE noise and incomplete CD compensation of the Kerr nonlinear term produce extra distortions that accumulates along the DBP stages. Therefore, the best DSP should balance between suppressing these distortions and inverting the fiber propagation effects, and such trade-off shifts across different DBP stages in a quantifiable manner. Instead of the common ‘black-box’ approach to intractable problems, our work shows how machine learning can be a complementary tool to human analytical thinking and help advance theoretical understandings in disciplines such as optics. Nonlinear effects provide inherent limitations in fiber optical communications. Here, the authors experimentally demonstrate improved digital back propagation with machine learning and use the results to reveal insights in the optimization of digital signal processing.",2020,2020-07-23 00:00:00,109.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa61bde9c5b220257e29d1118e68932729b21ea6

The goal of this research work is to develop a system that can effectively detect fall/collapse and classify other discrete daily living activities such as sitting, standing, walking, drinking, and bending. For this paper, a publicly accessible dataset is employed, which is captured at various geographical locations using a 5.8 GHz Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) RADAR. A total of ninety-nine participants, including young and elderly individuals, took part in the experimental campaign. During data acquisition, each aforementioned activity was recorded for 5–10 s. Through the obtained data, we generated the micro-doppler signatures using short-time Fourier transform by exploiting MATLAB tools. Subsequently, the micro-doppler signatures are validated, trained, and tested using a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm called Residual Neural Network or ResNet. The ResNet classifier is developed in Python, which is utilised to classify six distinct human activities in this study. Furthermore, the metrics used to analyse the trained model’s performance are precision, recall, F1-score, classification accuracy, and confusion matrix. To test the resilience of the proposed method, two separate experiments are carried out. The trained ResNet models are put to the test by subject-independent scenarios and unseen data of the above-mentioned human activities at diverse geographical spaces.

This health status is determined by the apparent decline of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs). Detecting ADLs provides possibilities of improving the home life of elderly people as it can be applied to fall detection systems. This paper presents fall detection in elderly people based on radar image classification by examining their daily routine activities, using radar data that were previously collected for 99 volunteers. Machine learning techniques are used classify six human activities, namely walking, sitting, standing, picking up objects, drinking water and fall events. Different machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, long short-term memory, bi-directional long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks, were used for data classification. To obtain optimum results, we applied data processing techniques, such as principal component analysis and data augmentation, to the available radar images. The aim of this paper is to improve upon the results achieved using a publicly available dataset to further improve upon research of fall detection systems. It was found out that the best results were obtained using the CNN algorithm with principal component analysis and data augmentation together to obtain a result of 95.30% accuracy. The results also demonstrated that principal component analysis was most beneficial when the training data were expanded by augmentation of the available data.

In real environments, activities and movements are performed with seamless motion, with continuous transitions between activities of different duration and a large range of dynamic motions, compared with discrete activities of fixed-time lengths which are typically analysed in the literature. This paper proposes a novel approach based on recurrent LSTM and Bi-LSTM network architectures for continuous activity monitoring and classification. This approach uses radar data in the form of a continuous temporal sequence of micro-Doppler or range-time information, differently from from other conventional approaches based on convolutional networks that interpret the radar data as images. Experimental radar data involving 15 participants and different sequences of 6 actions are used to validate the proposed approach. It is demonstrated that using the Doppler-domain data together with the Bi-LSTM network and an optimal learning rate can achieve over 90% mean accuracy, whereas range-domain data only achieved approximately 76%.

As such, fall detection is a crucial topic. However, due to the trade-off relationship between privacy preservation, user convenience, and fall detection performance, it is generally difficult to develop a fall detection system that simultaneously satisfies all conditions. The main goal of this study is to build a practical fall detection framework that can effectively classify the various behavior types into “Fall” and “Activities of daily living (ADL)” while securing privacy preservation and user convenience. For this purpose, signal data containing the motion information of objects was collected using a non-contact, unobtrusive, and non-restraint impulse-radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) radar. These data were then applied to a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to create an object behavior type classifier that can classify the behavior types of objects into “Fall” and “ADL.” The data were collected by actually performing various activities of daily living, including falling. The performance of the classifier yielded satisfactory results. By combining an IR-UWB and CNN algorithm, this study demonstrates the feasibility of building a practical fall detection system that exceeds a certain level of detection accuracy while also ensuring privacy preservation and user convenience.",2020,2020-10-01 00:00:00,31.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a9a0b22f131c996dc9cf1e24046d79a8f9d9ba

First, the traditional radar frequency band is difficult to meet the requirements of fine identification with due to its low carrier frequency and limited micro-Doppler resolution. Another significant problem is that radar signal processing is relatively complex, and the existing signal processing algorithms are poor in real-time usability, robustness and universality. This paper focuses on the two basic problems of human gait detection with radar and proposes a human gait classification and recognition method based on millimeter-wave array radar. Based on deep-learning technology, a multi-channel three-dimensional convolution neural network is proposed on the basis of improving the residual network, which completes the classification and recognition of human gait through the hierarchical extraction and fusion of multi-dimensional features. Taking the three-dimensional coordinates, motion speed and intensity of strong scattering points in the process of target motion as network inputs, multi-channel convolution is used to extract motion features, and the classification and recognition of typical daily actions are completed. The experimental results show that we have more than 92.5% recognition accuracy for common gait categories such as jogging and normal walking.",2020,2020-09-23 00:00:00,38.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28296eaf67a40f8aedde954755c018b59644101d

In particular, we find a deep neural network turns out to perform well in characterizing the neutralino jet substructure. We first construct a convolutional neutral network (CNN) which is capable of tagging the neutralino jet in any signal process by using the idea of jet image. When applied to pure jet samples, such a CNN outperforms the N-subjettiness variable by a factor of a few in tagging efficiency. Moreover, we find the method, which combines the CNN output and jet invariant mass, can perform better and is applicable to a wider range of neutralino mass than the CNN alone. Finally, the ATLAS search for the signal of gluino pair production with subsequent decay g˜→qqχ˜10(→qqq) is recast as an application. In contrast to the pure sample, the heavy contamination among jets in this complex final state renders the discriminating powers of the CNN and N subjettiness similar.

Therefore, it is essential to broaden the sensitivity of the search program to include unexpected scenarios. We present a new model-agnostic anomaly detection technique that naturally benefits from modern machine learning algorithms. The only requirement on the signal for this new procedure is that it is localized in at least one known direction in phase space. Any other directions of phase space that are uncorrelated with the localized one can be used to search for unexpected features.

This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent research into novel methods for cyber threat detection, encompassing diverse approaches such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, behavioral analysis and anomaly detection. Machine learning plays a central role in cyber threat detection, highlighting the effectiveness of deep neural networks in identifying evolving threats. Their adaptability to changing attack patterns is emphasized, underlining their importance for real-time security monitoring. In parallel, ensemble learning is explored, combining multiple models to improve overall detection accuracy and create a robust defense against a spectrum of cyber threats. The literature reviewed highlights the importance of behavioral analysis, with a novel approach that integrates user behaviour profiling with anomaly detection. This has proven effective in identifying suspicious activity within a network, particularly insider threats and stealthy attacks. Another behavioral framework using User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is presented for enhanced anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of context-aware monitoring in improving threat detection accuracy. Collaborative defense mechanisms emerge as a major focus of the research papers reviewed, exploring the potential of sharing threat information between organisations to enhance collective security monitoring. Their findings underscore the importance of a collaborative approach to staying ahead of rapidly evolving cyber threats. Some types of cyber-attacks are also analysed in the context of a security operations centre (SOC) monitoring environment using a security information and event management (SIEM) tool - Splunk. In conclusion, this survey paper synthesizes recent advances in cyber threat detection methods in security monitoring that integrate machine learning, behavioral analysis, and collaborative defense strategies.

10.3390/s24072122,End-to-End Network Intrusion Detection Based on Contrastive Learning,"The network intrusion detection system (NIDS) plays a crucial role as a security measure in addressing the increasing number of network threats. The majority of current research relies on feature-ready datasets that heavily depend on feature engineering. Conversely, the increasing complexity of network traffic and the ongoing evolution of attack techniques lead to a diminishing distinction between benign and malicious network behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end intrusion detection framework based on a contrastive learning approach. We design a hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to facilitate the automated extraction of spatiotemporal features from raw traffic data. The integration of contrastive learning amplifies the distinction between benign and malicious network traffic in the representation space. The proposed method exhibits enhanced detection capabilities for unknown attacks in comparison to the approaches trained using the cross-entropy loss function. Experiments are carried out on the public datasets CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, demonstrating that our method can attain a detection accuracy of 99.9% for known attacks, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance. For unknown attacks, a weighted recall rate of 95% can be achieved.",2024,2024-03-26 00:00:00,5.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a340540c1baa09b879bbc9f874fe50764ded0379

XAI has emerged as a pivotal focus in achieving a zero-trust cybersecurity strategy within marine communication networks. This article presents the development of a zero-trust NIDS framework designed to detect contemporary marine cyberattacks, utilizing two modern datasets (2023 Edge-IIoTset and 2023 CICIoT). The zero-trust NIDS model achieves an optimal Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of 97.33% and an F1-score of 99% in a multi-class experiment. The XAI approach leverages visual and quantitative XAI methods, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithms, to enhance explainability and interpretability. The research results indicate that current black-box NIDS models deployed for marine cyberdefense can be made more reliable and interpretable, thereby improving the overall cybersecurity posture of marine organizations.",2024,2024-01-08 00:00:00,8.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/324b957d6183f921898ae1dfacaba53fd9385dcf
10.3390/app132413310,Evaluating Ensemble Learning Mechanisms for Predicting Advanced Cyber Attacks,"With the increased sophistication of cyber-attacks, there is a greater demand for effective network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to protect against various threats. Traditional NIDS are incapable of detecting modern and sophisticated attacks due to the fact that they rely on pattern-matching models or simple activity analysis. Moreover, Intelligent NIDS based on Machine Learning (ML) models are still in the early stages and often exhibit low accuracy and high false positives, making them ineffective in detecting emerging cyber-attacks. On the other hand, improved detection and prediction frameworks provided by ensemble algorithms have demonstrated impressive outcomes in specific applications. In this research, we investigate the potential of ensemble models in the enhancement of NIDS functionalities in order to provide a reliable and intelligent security defense. We present a NIDS hybrid model that uses ensemble ML techniques to identify and prevent various intrusions more successfully than stand-alone approaches. A combination of several distinct machine learning methods is integrated into a hybrid framework. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is pre-processed, and its features are engineered prior to being used to train and evaluate the proposed model structure. The performance evaluation of the ensemble of various ML classifiers demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms individual model approaches. Using all the employed experimental combination forms, the designed model significantly enhances the detection accuracy attaining more than 99%, while false positives are reduced to less than 1%.",2023,2023-12-16 00:00:00,4.0,26.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fbf387974cef504a7ecb37c6ac10046346db4a2
10.1111/exsy.13518,Network intrusion detection system by learning jointly from tabular and text‐based features,"Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) play a critical role in maintaining the security and integrity of computer networks. These systems are designed to detect and respond to anomalous activities that may indicate malicious intent or unauthorized access. The need for robust NIDS solutions has never been more pressing in today's digital landscape, characterized by constantly evolving cyber threats. Deploying effective NIDS can be challenging, particularly in accurately identifying network anomalies amid the ever‐increasing sophisticated and difficult‐to‐detect cyber threats. The motivation for our research stems from the recognition that while NIDS studies have made significant strides, there remains a crucial need for more effective and accurate methods to detect network anomalies. Commonly used features in NIDS studies include network logs, with some studies exploring text‐based features such as payload. However, traditional machine and deep learning models may need to be improved in learning jointly from tabular and text‐based features. Here, we present a new approach that integrates both tabular and text‐based features to improve the performance of NIDS. Our research aims to address the existing limitations of NIDS and contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient network security solutions by introducing more effective and accurate methods for detecting network anomalies. Our internal experiments have revealed that the deep learning approach utilizing tabular features produces favourable results, whereas the pre‐trained transformer approach needs to perform sufficiently. Hence, our proposed approach, which integrates both feature types using deep learning and pre‐trained transformer approaches, achieves superior performance. These findings indicate that integrating both feature types using deep learning and pre‐trained transformer approaches can significantly improve the accuracy of network anomaly detection. Moreover, our proposed approach outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art methods in terms of accuracy, F1‐score, and recall on commonly used NIDS datasets consisting of ISCX‐IDS2012, UNSW‐NB15, and CIC‐IDS2017, with F1‐scores of 99.80%, 92.37%, and 99.69%, respectively, indicating its effectiveness in detecting network anomalies.",2023,2023-12-12 00:00:00,9.0,62.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0d69d52189594fdb4b4333ab53627479cba4a4e
10.3390/app13116839,A Malware Detection and Extraction Method for the Related Information Using the ViT Attention Mechanism on Android Operating System,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being utilized in cybersecurity, particularly for detecting malicious applications. However, the black-box nature of AI models presents a significant challenge. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand and trust the results. In order to address this, it is necessary to incorporate explainability into the detection model. There is insufficient research to provide reasons why applications are detected as malicious or explain their behavior. In this paper, we propose a method of a Vision Transformer(ViT)-based malware detection model and malicious behavior extraction using an attention map to achieve high detection accuracy and high interpretability. Malware detection uses a ViT-based model, which takes an image as input. ViT offers a significant advantage for image detection tasks by leveraging attention mechanisms, enabling robust interpretation and understanding of the intricate patterns within the images. The image is converted from an application. An attention map is generated with attention values generated during the detection process. The attention map is used to identify factors that the model deems important. Class and method names are extracted and provided based on the identified factors. The performance of the detection was validated using real-world datasets. The malware detection accuracy was 80.27%, which is a high level of accuracy compared to other models used for image-based malware detection. The interpretability was measured in the same way as the F1-score, resulting in an interpretability score of 0.70. This score is superior to existing interpretable machine learning (ML)-based methods, such as Drebin, LIME, and XMal. By analyzing malicious applications, we also confirmed that the extracted classes and methods are related to malicious behavior. With the proposed method, security experts can understand the reason behind the model’s detection and the behavior of malicious applications. Given the growing importance of explainable artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, this method is expected to make a significant contribution to this field.",2023,2023-06-05 00:00:00,13.0,21.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c68ecb3e20c68135429c78eaf4a7984451e8996

10.3389/fbinf.2022.866902,Cronos: A Machine Learning Pipeline for Description and Predictive Modeling of Microbial Communities Over Time,"Microbial time-series analysis, typically, examines the abundances of individual taxa over time and attempts to assign etiology to observed patterns. This approach assumes homogeneous groups in terms of profiles and response to external effectors. These assumptions are not always fulfilled, especially in complex natural systems, like the microbiome of the human gut. It is actually established that humans with otherwise the same demographic or dietary backgrounds can have distinct microbial profiles. We suggest an alternative approach to the analysis of microbial time-series, based on the following premises: 1) microbial communities are organized in distinct clusters of similar composition at any time point, 2) these intrinsic subsets of communities could have different responses to the same external effects, and 3) the fate of the communities is largely deterministic given the same external conditions. Therefore, tracking the transition of communities, rather than individual taxa, across these states, can enhance our understanding of the ecological processes and allow the prediction of future states, by incorporating applied effects. We implement these ideas into Cronos, an analytical pipeline written in R. Cronos’ inputs are a microbial composition table (e.g., OTU table), their phylogenetic relations as a tree, and the associated metadata. Cronos detects the intrinsic microbial profile clusters on all time points, describes them in terms of composition, and records the transitions between them. Cluster assignments, combined with the provided metadata, are used to model the transitions and predict samples’ fate under various effects. We applied Cronos to available data from growing infants’ gut microbiomes, and we observe two distinct trajectories corresponding to breastfed and formula-fed infants that eventually converge to profiles resembling those of mature individuals.

10.1002/wics.1575,Stability estimation for unsupervised clustering: A review,"Cluster analysis remains one of the most challenging yet fundamental tasks in unsupervised learning. This is due in part to the fact that there are no labels or gold standards by which performance can be measured. Moreover, the wide range of clustering methods available is governed by different objective functions, different parameters, and dissimilarity measures. The purpose of clustering is versatile, often playing critical roles in the early stages of exploratory data analysis and as an endpoint for knowledge and discovery. Thus, understanding the quality of a clustering is of critical importance. The concept of stability has emerged as a strategy for assessing the performance and reproducibility of data clustering. The key idea is to produce perturbed data sets that are very close to the original, and cluster them. If the clustering is stable, then the clusters from the original data will be preserved in the perturbed data clustering. The nature of the perturbation, and the methods for quantifying similarity between clusterings, are nontrivial, and ultimately what distinguishes many of the stability estimation methods apart. In this review, we provide an overview of the very active research area of cluster stability estimation and discuss some of the open questions and challenges that remain in the field.",2022,2022-01-09 00:00:00,29.0,99.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07e1871d453de64cf3d70c3db47b48243e28ba4b

10.3390/s17071513,Analysis of Public Datasets for Wearable Fall Detection Systems,"Due to the boom of wireless handheld devices such as smartwatches and smartphones, wearable Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) have become a major focus of attention among the research community during the last years. The effectiveness of a wearable FDS must be contrasted against a wide variety of measurements obtained from inertial sensors during the occurrence of falls and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). In this regard, the access to public databases constitutes the basis for an open and systematic assessment of fall detection techniques. This paper reviews and appraises twelve existing available data repositories containing measurements of ADLs and emulated falls envisaged for the evaluation of fall detection algorithms in wearable FDSs. The analysis of the found datasets is performed in a comprehensive way, taking into account the multiple factors involved in the definition of the testbeds deployed for the generation of the mobility samples. The study of the traces brings to light the lack of a common experimental benchmarking procedure and, consequently, the large heterogeneity of the datasets from a number of perspectives (length and number of samples, typology of the emulated falls and ADLs, characteristics of the test subjects, features and positions of the sensors, etc.). Concerning this, the statistical analysis of the samples reveals the impact of the sensor range on the reliability of the traces. In addition, the study evidences the importance of the selection of the ADLs and the need of categorizing the ADLs depending on the intensity of the movements in order to evaluate the capability of a certain detection algorithm to discriminate falls from ADLs.",2017,2017-06-27 00:00:00,116.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13d425987501e4ce59db5cddda299df525c5c234

Here, we present a dataset of falls and activities of daily living (ADLs) acquired with a self-developed device composed of two types of accelerometer and one gyroscope. It consists of 19 ADLs and 15 fall types performed by 23 young adults, 15 ADL types performed by 14 healthy and independent participants over 62 years old, and data from one participant of 60 years old that performed all ADLs and falls. These activities were selected based on a survey and a literature analysis. We test the dataset with widely used feature extraction and a simple to implement threshold based classification, achieving up to 96% of accuracy in fall detection. An individual activity analysis demonstrates that most errors coincide in a few number of activities where new approaches could be focused. Finally, validation tests with elderly people significantly reduced the fall detection performance of the tested features.

These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725–0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 95% CI, 0.734–0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models. Conclusions ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic mortality. The individualized prognostic model on the basis of the nomogram could accurately predict ICU-acquired infection and optimize management or tailored therapy.",2022,2022-07-28 00:00:00,21.0,47.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/710634fe9e09edd157f1157996a126b60b87c0ef
10.1038/s41746-022-00650-5,Effectiveness of automated alerting system compared to usual care for the management of sepsis,"There is a large body of evidence showing that delayed initiation of sepsis bundle is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. However, it is controversial whether electronic automated alerts can help improve clinical outcomes of sepsis. Electronic databases are searched from inception to December 2021 for comparative effectiveness studies comparing automated alerts versus usual care for the management of sepsis. A total of 36 studies are eligible for analysis, including 6 randomized controlled trials and 30 non-randomized studies. There is significant heterogeneity in these studies concerning the study setting, design, and alerting methods. The Bayesian meta-analysis by using pooled effects of non-randomized studies as priors shows a beneficial effect of the alerting system (relative risk [RR]: 0.71; 95% credible interval: 0.62 to 0.81) in reducing mortality. The automated alerting system shows less beneficial effects in the intensive care unit (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.73–1.11) than that in the emergency department (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.51–0.90) and ward (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61–0.82). Furthermore, machine learning-based prediction methods can reduce mortality by a larger magnitude (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39–0.80) than rule-based methods (RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.63–0.85). The study shows a statistically significant beneficial effect of using the automated alerting system in the management of sepsis. Interestingly, machine learning monitoring systems coupled with better early interventions show promise, especially for patients outside of the intensive care unit.",2022,2022-07-19 00:00:00,25.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac76c3422a762b355b0348e4bd9d62d046721ba1
10.1186/s12911-022-01903-9,Which model is superior in predicting ICU survival: artificial intelligence versus conventional approaches,"A disease severity classification system is widely used to predict the survival of patients admitted to the intensive care unit with different diagnoses. In the present study, conventional severity classification systems were compared with artificial intelligence predictive models (Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree) in terms of the prediction of the survival rate of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit. This retrospective cohort study was performed on the data of the patients admitted to the ICU of Ghaemshahr’s Razi Teaching Care Center from March 20th, 2017, to September 22nd, 2019. The required data for calculating conventional severity classification models (SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, and APACHE IV) were collected from the patients’ medical records. Subsequently, the score of each model was calculated. Artificial intelligence predictive models (Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree) were developed in the next step. Lastly, the performance of each model in predicting the survival of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit was evaluated using the criteria of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-measure, and area under the ROC curve. Also, each model was validated externally. The R program, version 4.1, was used to create the artificial intelligence models, and SPSS Statistics Software, version 21, was utilized to perform statistical analysis. The area under the ROC curve of SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, APACHE IV, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, and CART decision tree were 76.0, 77.1, 80.3, 78.5, 84.1, and 80.0, respectively. The results showed that although the APACHE II model had better results than other conventional models in predicting the survival rate of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the other conventional models provided acceptable results too. Moreover, the findings showed that the artificial neural network model had the best performance among all the studied models, indicating the discrimination power of this model in predicting patient survival compared to the other models.",2022,2022-06-26 00:00:00,13.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d517fdb8911ce89b12fda685def6408c157c67e

10.1007/s40121-022-00628-6,Interpretable Machine Learning for Early Prediction of Prognosis in Sepsis: A Discovery and Validation Study,"This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine-learning model based on clinical features for early predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. We enrolled all patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.1.0) database from 2008 to 2019. Lasso regression was used for feature selection. Seven machine-learning methods were applied to develop the models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy and area under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to illustrate the effects of the features attributed to the model, and to analyze how the individual features affect the output of the model, and to visualize the Shapley value for a single individual. In total, 8,817 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation, the median age was 66.8 years (IQR, 55.9–77.1 years), and 3361 of 8817 participants (38.1%) were women. After selection, 25 of a total 57 clinical parameters collected on day 1 after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and were used for developing the machine-learning models. Among seven constructed models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.884 and an accuracy of 89.5% in the validation cohort. Feature importance analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, blood urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, urine output, and age were the top 5 features of the XGBoost model with the greatest impact. Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model visualized the individualized prediction of death. We have demonstrated the potential of machine-learning approaches for predicting outcome early in patients with sepsis. The SHAP method could improve the interpretability of machine-learning models and help clinicians better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.",2022,2022-04-10 00:00:00,74.0,33.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/febba7ed03929ff81b1c70de66a0b05f87966b22
10.2196/38082,Predicting Mortality in Intensive Care Unit Patients With Heart Failure Using an Interpretable Machine Learning Model: Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background Heart failure (HF) is a common disease and a major public health problem. HF mortality prediction is critical for developing individualized prevention and treatment plans. However, due to their lack of interpretability, most HF mortality prediction models have not yet reached clinical practice. Objective We aimed to develop an interpretable model to predict the mortality risk for patients with HF in intensive care units (ICUs) and used the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to explain the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model and explore prognostic factors for HF. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we achieved model development and performance comparison on the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). We extracted data during the first 24 hours of each ICU admission, and the data set was randomly divided, with 70% used for model training and 30% used for model validation. The prediction performance of the XGBoost model was compared with three other machine learning models by the area under the curve. We used the SHAP method to explain the XGBoost model. Results A total of 2798 eligible patients with HF were included in the final cohort for this study. The observed in-hospital mortality of patients with HF was 9.97%. Comparatively, the XGBoost model had the highest predictive performance among four models with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.824 (95% CI 0.7766-0.8708), whereas support vector machine had the poorest generalization ability (AUC=0.701, 95% CI 0.6433-0.7582). The decision curve showed that the net benefit of the XGBoost model surpassed those of other machine learning models at 10%~28% threshold probabilities. The SHAP method reveals the top 20 predictors of HF according to the importance ranking, and the average of the blood urea nitrogen was recognized as the most important predictor variable. Conclusions The interpretable predictive model helps physicians more accurately predict the mortality risk in ICU patients with HF, and therefore, provides better treatment plans and optimal resource allocation for their patients. In addition, the interpretable framework can increase the transparency of the model and facilitate understanding the reliability of the predictive model for the physicians.",2022,2022-03-18 00:00:00,63.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/afe82f3559ff218cbc6c6e54a068be15ad7d03d8
10.1155/2022/4802702,Red Cell Distribution Width to Platelet Ratio Is Associated with Increasing In-Hospital Mortality in Critically Ill Patients with Acute Kidney Injury,"Background Inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology and progression of acute kidney injury (AKI). Red cell distribution width (RDW) to platelet ratio (RPR) is a novel inflammatory index, and its prognostic effect on critically ill patients with AKI is rarely investigated. This work is aimed at investigating the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality in these patients. Methods Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. All-cause death during hospitalization was selected as the primary outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off value, and the area under the curve (AUC) was applied to compare predictive ability among different indices. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to assess the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality. Restricted cubic spline analysis for multivariate Cox model was performed to explore the shape of the relationship between RPR and mortality. Results A total of 24,166 critically ill patients with AKI were included. The relationship of RPR and in-hospital mortality was nonlinear with a trend to rise rapidly and then gradually. For mortality prediction, RPR had the optimal cut-off value of 0.093, of which the AUC was 0.791 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.773–0.810), which was higher than those of RDW, platelet, sequential organ failure assessment score, simplified acute physiology score II, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and platelet to lymphocytes ratio. After adjustments for various confounders, high RPR showed a significant association with increased mortality with hazard ratios of 1.46 (95% CI: 1.40–1.55) for categorical variable and 1.88 (95% CI: 1.80–1.97) for continuous variables in the fully adjusted model. Conclusions Elevated RPR on admission is substantially associated with high risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with AKI and thus may serve as a novel predictor of prognosis for these patients.",2022,2022-01-17 00:00:00,26.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/025f783c9c95aff59a44fdb3299ba468806ab632

10.1145/3540250.3549103,Adaptive fairness improvement based on causality analysis,"Given a discriminating neural network, the problem of fairness improvement is to systematically reduce discrimination without significantly scarifies its performance (i.e., accuracy). Multiple categories of fairness improving methods have been proposed for neural networks, including pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing. Our empirical study however shows that these methods are not always effective (e.g., they may improve fairness by paying the price of huge accuracy drop) or even not helpful (e.g., they may even worsen both fairness and accuracy). In this work, we propose an approach which adaptively chooses the fairness improving method based on causality analysis. That is, we choose the method based on how the neurons and attributes responsible for unfairness are distributed among the input attributes and the hidden neurons. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is effective (i.e., always identify the best fairness improving method) and efficient (i.e., with an average time overhead of 5 minutes).",2022,2022-09-15 00:00:00,29.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8f4bfaca3ebf42128226182d6f303ae22d244bb
10.1145/3510003.3510080,Causality-Based Neural Network Repair,"Neural networks have had discernible achievements in a wide range of applications. The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern of their dependability and reliability. Similar to traditional decision-making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to be repaired. The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security concerns or unjust societal impacts. In this work, we address the problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to construct a neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting the given neural network's parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically, we propose CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a causality-based neural network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault localization to identify the ‘guilty’ neurons and 2) optimizes the parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior. We have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE successfully improves fairness by 61.91 % on average. For backdoor removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over 98% to less than 1 %. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation rate to less than 1 %. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based fault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of the neural networks.",2022,2022-04-20 00:00:00,73.0,70.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cb0bd9f5927403bf29c3b9ccd25a79daac55194

Apart from the robustness and safety, fairness is also an important property that a well-designed DL system should have. To evaluate and improve individual fairness of a model, systematic test case generation for identifying individual discriminatory instances in the input space is essential. In this paper, we propose a framework EIDIG for efficiently discovering individual fairness violation. Our technique combines a global generation phase for rapidly generating a set of diverse discriminatory seeds with a local generation phase for generating as many individual discriminatory instances as possible around these seeds under the guidance of the gradient of the model output. In each phase, prior information at successive iterations is fully exploited to accelerate convergence of iterative optimization or reduce frequency of gradient calculation. Our experimental results show that, on average, our approach EIDIG generates 19.11% more individual discriminatory instances with a speedup of 121.49% when compared with the state-of-the-art method and mitigates individual discrimination by 80.03% with a limited accuracy loss after retraining.",2021,2021-07-11 00:00:00,36.0,61.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17d6147ed81075000bf3dac2bae7d7f9acb05d76

In this study, we employ artificial intelligence (AI)-powered histopathology image analysis to differentiate between p53abn and NSMP EC subtypes and consequently identify a sub-group of NSMP EC patients that has markedly inferior progression-free and disease-specific survival (termed ‘p53abn-like NSMP’), in a discovery cohort of 368 patients and two independent validation cohorts of 290 and 614 from other centers. Shallow whole genome sequencing reveals a higher burden of copy number abnormalities in the ‘p53abn-like NSMP’ group compared to NSMP, suggesting that this group is biologically distinct compared to other NSMP ECs.

Yet, due to their rarity and the associated testing costs, systematic screening for these mutations is not commonly pursued. Notably, the histopathological phenotype resulting from POLE mutations is theorized to resemble that of MSI. This resemblance not only could facilitate their detection by a transformer-based Deep Learning (DL) system trained on MSI pathology slides, but also indicates the possibility for MSS patients with POLE mutations to access enhanced treatment options, which might otherwise be overlooked. To harness this potential, we trained a Deep Learning classifier on a large dataset with the ground truth for microsatellite status and subsequently validated its capabilities for MSI and POLE detection across three external cohorts. Our model accurately identified MSI status in both the internal and external resection cohorts using pathology images alone. Notably, with a classification threshold of 0.5, over 75% of POLE driver mutant patients in the external resection cohorts were flagged as “positive” by a DL system trained on MSI status. In a clinical setting, deploying this DL model as a preliminary screening tool could facilitate the efficient identification of clinically relevant MSI and POLE mutations in colorectal tumors, in one go.",2024,2024-05-23 00:00:00,6.0,62.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b3c4c1eceedda0c415ee1eb59c58769b3c20a8f

With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge—the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers—to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted κ, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840–0.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835–0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials. Through a community-driven competition, the PANDA challenge provides a curated diverse dataset and a catalog of models for prostate cancer pathology, and represents a blueprint for evaluating AI algorithms in digital pathology.",2022,2022-01-01 00:00:00,344.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/551a32d6bb196127b75d256e8547b81ef67a7ad3

10.1038/s43018-020-0085-8,"Pan-cancer computational histopathology reveals mutations, tumor composition and prognosis","We use deep transfer learning to quantify histopathological patterns across 17,355 hematoxylin and eosin-stained histopathology slide images from 28 cancer types and correlate these with matched genomic, transcriptomic and survival data. This approach accurately classifies cancer types and provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction. Automatically learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer types. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal aneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological subtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates. These findings show the remarkable potential of computer vision in characterizing the molecular basis of tumor histopathology.

10.3390/su14127375,Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Malicious Domains Detection Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),"With the expansion of the internet, a major threat has emerged involving the spread of malicious domains intended by attackers to perform illegal activities aiming to target governments, violating privacy of organizations, and even manipulating everyday users. Therefore, detecting these harmful domains is necessary to combat the growing network attacks. Machine Learning (ML) models have shown significant outcomes towards the detection of malicious domains. However, the “black box” nature of the complex ML models obstructs their wide-ranging acceptance in some of the fields. The emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has successfully incorporated the interpretability and explicability in the complex models. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI model has enabled the interpretability without affecting the performance of the models. This study aimed to propose an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model to detect malicious domains on a recent dataset containing 45,000 samples of malicious and non-malicious domains. In the current study, initially several interpretable ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB), and black box ensemble models, such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), AdaBoost (AB), and Cat Boost (CB) algorithms, were implemented and found that XGB outperformed the other classifiers. Furthermore, the post hoc XAI global surrogate model (Shapley additive explanations) and local surrogate LIME were used to generate the explanation of the XGB prediction. Two sets of experiments were performed; initially the model was executed using a preprocessed dataset and later with selected features using the Sequential Forward Feature selection algorithm. The results demonstrate that ML algorithms were able to distinguish benign and malicious domains with overall accuracy ranging from 0.8479 to 0.9856. The ensemble classifier XGB achieved the highest result, with an AUC and accuracy of 0.9991 and 0.9856, respectively, before the feature selection algorithm, while there was an AUC of 0.999 and accuracy of 0.9818 after the feature selection algorithm. The proposed model outperformed the benchmark study.",2022,2022-06-16 00:00:00,38.0,28.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0dd67335d80194e7ccf6c0ed275622bf60e5edce
10.3390/fi13120309,DNS Firewall Based on Machine Learning,"Nowadays there are many DNS firewall solutions to prevent users accessing malicious domains. These can provide real-time protection and block illegitimate communications, contributing to the cybersecurity posture of the organizations. Most of these solutions are based on known malicious domain lists that are being constantly updated. However, in this way, it is only possible to block malicious communications for known malicious domains, leaving out many others that are malicious but have not yet been updated in the blocklists. This work provides a study to implement a DNS firewall solution based on ML and so improve the detection of malicious domain requests on the fly. For this purpose, a dataset with 34 features and 90 k records was created based on real DNS logs. The data were enriched using OSINT sources. Exploratory analysis and data preparation steps were carried out, and the final dataset submitted to different Supervised ML algorithms to accurately and quickly classify if a domain request is malicious or not. The results show that the ML algorithms were able to classify the benign and malicious domains with accuracy rates between 89% and 96%, and with a classification time between 0.01 and 3.37 s. The contributions of this study are twofold. In terms of research, a dataset was made public and the methodology can be used by other researchers. In terms of solution, the work provides the baseline to implement an in band DNS firewall.",2021,2021-11-30 00:00:00,13.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8bdb4900b207c7b1f5cfd5dd4752997f9765e738

Currently, NMTF learns a representation of a dataset through an optimization procedure that typically uses multiplicative update rules. This procedure has had limited success, and its failure cases have not been well understood. We here perform an empirical study involving six large datasets comparing multiplicative update rules with three alternative optimization methods, including alternating least squares, projected gradients, and coordinate descent. We find that methods based on projected gradients and coordinate descent converge up to twenty-four times faster than multiplicative update rules. Furthermore, alternating least squares method can quickly train NMTF models on sparse datasets but often fails on dense datasets.

The objective of this mixed research is to analyze the impact of the flipped classroom in the teaching-learning process on statistics considering data science and machine learning (linear regression). The sample consists of 61 students who took the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course during the 2018 school year. This research proposes the consultation of the YouTube videos before the class, performance of the collaborative exercises and use of the spreadsheet to check the results during the class and performance of the laboratory practices through the spreadsheet after the class. The results of machine learning (70%, 80% and 90% of training) indicate that the participation of the students before, during and after the class positively influences the assimilation of knowledge and development of mathematical skills about the frequencies and measures of central tendency. On the other hand, the decision tree technique identifies 6 predictive models on the use of the flipped classroom. Also, the students of the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course are motivated and satisfied to use the technological tools in the Introduction to statistics Unit.

Methods Eighty second- and third-year undergraduates in Lanzhou University were recruited and randomized to either three experimental groups or one control group. The subjects undertook theoretical examinations to test their basic level of knowledge after training in similarly unified knowledge courses. Each student group then participated in an eight-hour operating training session. An operation test on pig mandible was conducted, followed by a second theoretical examination. The assessment consists of three distinct parts: a subjective operating score by a clinical senior teacher, an implant accuracy analysis in cone-beam computed tomography (angular, apical, and entrance deviation), and comparison of the two theoretical examinations. Finally, students completed a questionnaire gauging their understanding of the virtual simulation. Results There was no significant difference between the four groups in first theoretical examination ( P  > 0.05); the second theoretical scores of the V-J and J-V group (62.90 ± 3.70, 60.05 ± 2.73) were significantly higher than the first time (57.05 ± 3.92, P  < 0.05), while no difference between the V (57.10 ± 3.66) and J (56.89 ± 2.67) groups was found. Thus, the combination of V-J was effective in improving students’ theoretical scores. The V-J and J-V groups had higher scores on operation (73.98 ± 4.58, 71.85 ± 4.67) and showed better implant precision. Conclusion Virtual simulation education, especially with a jaw simulation model, could improve students’ implantology achievements and training.

To investigate the effect of flipped classroom approach on teaching evidence-based medicine to medical technology students, we conducted a tailor-made six flipped classroom based EBM courses for medical technology students. This study adopted a qusai-experimental design with 62 medical technology interns as the research object. Students in the experimental group attended the flipped classroom course, while students in the control group attended the traditional course. The learning outcomes were evaluated by Fresno test in both groups. Furthermore, to understand student’s perceptions on the flipped classroom approach, students in the experimental group were required to fill in a satisfaction survey and answer some open-ended questions. The Fresno test scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than that of the control group. From the results of the satisfaction survey, we know that students were satisfied with this course format. Students claimed that the flipped classroom approach could improve their learning efficiency and the interactions with teacher could help them to think more deeply. To conclude, most students showed positive attitudes and views on flipped classroom strategy.

10.1051/EPJCONF/201920705005,Reconstruction Techniques in IceCube using Convolutional and Generative Neural Networks,"Reliable and accurate reconstruction methods are vital to the success of high-energy physics experiments such as IceCube. Machine learning based techniques, in particular deep neural networks, can provide a viable alternative to maximum-likelihood methods. However, most common neural network architectures were developed for other domains such as image recogntion. While these methods can enhance the reconstruction performance in IceCube, there is much potential for tailored techniques. In the typical physics use-case, many symmetries, invariances and prior knowledge exist in the data, which are not fully exploited by current network architectures. Novel and specialized deep learning based reconstruction techniques are desired which can leverage the physics potential of experiments like IceCube.
A reconstruction method using convolutional neural networks is presented which can significantly increase the reconstruction accuracy while greatly reducing the runtime in comparison to standard reconstruction methods in Ice- Cube. In addition, first results are discussed for future developments based on generative neural networks.",2019,2019-10-01 00:00:00,10.0,10.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b5378514457d040b7f8299d3799d25786e190e2

This three-dimensional array of light sensors allows the observation of time and spatial variations of the ambient light field. We report on observation of an increase of luminescence activity in 2016 and 2018. On the contrary, we observed practically constant optical noise in 2017.

10.22323/1.301.1057,Deep Learning in Physics exemplified by the Reconstruction of Muon-Neutrino Events in IceCube,"Recent advances, especially in image recognition, have shown the capabilities of deep learning. 
Deep neural networks can be extremely powerful and their usage is computationally inexpensive once the networks are trained. 
While the main bottleneck for deep neural networks in the traditional domain of image classification is the lack of sufficient labeled data, this usually does not apply to physics where millions of Monte Carlo simulations exist. 
 
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a Cherenkov detector deep in the Antarctic ice where the reconstruction of muon-neutrino events is one of the key challenges. 
Due to limited computational resources and the high data rate, only simplified reconstructions limited to a small subset of data can be run on-site at the South Pole. 
However, in order to perform online analysis and to issue real-time alerts, a fast and powerful reconstruction is necessary. 
 
This paper demonstrates how deep learning techniques such as those used in image recognition can be applied to IceCube pulses in order to reconstruct muon-neutrino events. 
These methods can be generalized to other physics experiments.",2017,2017-08-16 00:00:00,20.0,3.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72ea53f9972e8346b728dc0474df3b081e1795b5

Similar to the 2015 task, the goal of the shared task is to identify individual discourse relations that are present in natural language text. Given a natural language text, participating teams are asked to locate the discourse connectives (explicit or implicit) and their arguments as well as predicting the sense of the discourse connectives. Based on the success of the previous year, we continued to ask participants to deploy their systems on TIRA, a web-based platform on which participants can run their systems on the test data for evaluation. This evaluation methodology preserves the integrity of the shared task. We have also made a few changes and additions in the 2016 shared task based on the feedback from 2015. The first is that teams could choose to carry out the task on Chinese texts, or English texts, or both. We have also allowed participants to focus on parts of the shared task (rather than the whole thing) as a typical system requires substantial investment of effort. Finally, we have modified the scorer so that it can report results based on partial matches of the arguments. 23 teams participated in this year’s shared task, using a wide variety of approaches. In this overview paper, we present the task definition, the training and test sets, and the evaluation protocol and metric used during this shared task. We also summarize the different approaches adopted by the participating teams, and present the evaluation results.

10.18653/v1/D15-1264,Closing the Gap: Domain Adaptation from Explicit to Implicit Discourse Relations,"Many discourse relations are explicitly marked with discourse connectives, and these examples could potentially serve as a plentiful source of training data for recognizing implicit discourse relations. However, there are important linguistic differences between explicit and implicit discourse relations, which limit the accuracy of such an approach. We account for these differences by applying techniques from domain adaptation, treating implicitly and explicitly-marked discourse relations as separate domains. The distribution of surface features varies across these two domains, so we apply a marginalized denoising autoencoder to induce a dense, domain-general representation. The label distribution is also domain-specific, so we apply a resampling technique that is similar to instance weighting. In combination with a set of automatically-labeled data, these improvements eliminate more than 80% of the transfer loss incurred by training an implicit discourse relation classifier on explicitly-marked discourse relations.",2015,2015-09-01 00:00:00,30.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b8d7847251fa73e78e0cad9ef78e25490345539

The shallow structure alleviates the overfitting problem, while the convolution and nonlinear operations help preserve the recognition and generalization ability of our model.

10.1038/s41598-021-85838-7,Magnetoinductive waves in attenuating media,"The capability of magnetic induction to transmit signals in attenuating environments has recently gained significant research interest. The wave aspect—magnetoinductive (MI) waves—has been proposed for numerous applications in RF-challenging environments, such as underground/underwater wireless networks, body area networks, and in-vivo medical diagnosis and treatment applications, to name but a few, where conventional electromagnetic waves have a number of limitations, most notably losses. To date, the effects of eddy currents inside the dissipative medium have not been characterised analytically. Here we propose a comprehensive circuit model of coupled resonators in a homogeneous dissipative medium, that takes into account all the electromagnetic effects of eddy currents, and, thereby, derive a general dispersion equation for the MI waves. We also report laboratory experiments to confirm our findings. Our work will serve as a fundamental model for design and analysis of every system employing MI waves or more generally, magnetically-coupled circuits in attenuating media.",2021,2021-04-07 00:00:00,9.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d759a32b086245ad7cdc75b519305c7a9138401a

Studies have focused on chemical analysis of biofluids for PMI estimation; however, no reports using spectroscopic methods in pericardial fluid (PF) are available. In this study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory was applied to collect comprehensive biochemical information from rabbit PF at different PMIs. The PMI-dependent spectral signature was determined by two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis. The partial least square (PLS) and nu-support vector machine (nu-SVM) models were then established based on the acquired spectral dataset. Spectral variables associated with amide I, amide II, COO−, C-H bending, and C-O or C-OH vibrations arising from proteins, polypeptides, amino acids and carbohydrates, respectively, were susceptible to PMI in 2D correlation analysis. Moreover, the nu-SVM model appeared to achieve a more satisfactory prediction than the PLS model in calibration; the reliability of both models was determined in an external validation set.

In this study, Fourier transform infrared spectra were collected from 88 endoscopic biopsy colorectal tissue samples (41 colitis and 47 cancers). A new method, viz., entropy weight local-hyperplane k-nearest-neighbor (EWHK), which is an improved version of K-local hyperplane distance nearest-neighbor (HKNN), is proposed for tissue classification. In order to avoid limiting high dimensions and small values of the nearest neighbor, the new EWHK method calculates feature weights based on information entropy. The average results of the random classification showed that the EWHK classifier for differentiating cancer from colitis samples produced a sensitivity of 81.38% and a specificity of 92.69%.",2017,2017-11-27 00:00:00,22.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b6fe982d9a5136eca985afc2efb2470f4d4bb3b

Temperature is believed to be the most important and can be connected to decomposition by using the accumulated degree days (ADD). The aim of this research was to develop a decomposition scoring method and to develop a formula to estimate the PMI by using the developed decomposition scoring method and ADD.A decomposition scoring method and a Book of Reference (visual resource) were made. Ninety-one cases were used to develop a method to estimate the PMI. The photographs were scored using the decomposition scoring method. The temperature data was provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. The PMI was estimated using the total decomposition score (TDS) and using the TDS and ADD. The latter required an additional step, namely to calculate the ADD from the finding date back until the predicted day of death.The developed decomposition scoring method had a high interrater reliability. The TDS significantly estimates the PMI (R2 = 0.67 and 0.80 for indoor and outdoor bodies, respectively). When using the ADD, the R2 decreased to 0.66 and 0.56.The developed decomposition scoring method is a practical method to measure decomposition for human remains found on land. The PMI can be estimated using this method, but caution is advised in cases with a long PMI.

10.1101/2020.02.03.932350,Machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures for rapid classification of novel pathogens: COVID-19 case study,"As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to 30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.",2020,2020-02-04 00:00:00,496.0,110.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4387d52b5c48f386a1fa3e11d529c3a89ee0717

10.1155/2019/9397578,Machine Learning Model for Imbalanced Cholera Dataset in Tanzania,"Cholera epidemic remains a public threat throughout history, affecting vulnerable population living with unreliable water and substandard sanitary conditions. Various studies have observed that the occurrence of cholera has strong linkage with environmental factors such as climate change and geographical location. Climate change has been strongly linked to the seasonal occurrence and widespread of cholera through the creation of weather patterns that favor the disease's transmission, infection, and the growth of Vibrio cholerae, which cause the disease. Over the past decades, there have been great achievements in developing epidemic models for the proper prediction of cholera. However, the integration of weather variables and use of machine learning techniques have not been explicitly deployed in modeling cholera epidemics in Tanzania due to the challenges that come with its datasets such as imbalanced data and missing information. This paper explores the use of machine learning techniques to model cholera epidemics with linkage to seasonal weather changes while overcoming the data imbalance problem. Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to the restore sampling balance and dimensional of the dataset. In addition, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced-accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the seven models. Based on the results of the Wilcoxon sign-rank test and features of the models, XGBoost classifier was selected to be the best model for the study. Overall results improved our understanding of the significant roles of machine learning strategies in health-care data. However, the study could not be treated as a time series problem due to the data collection bias. The study recommends a review of health-care systems in order to facilitate quality data collection and deployment of machine learning techniques.",2019,2019-07-25 00:00:00,27.0,75.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d37126461de58f1b8858abc85cbb0ab43209e4bc

10.7717/peerj.14311,Comparison of iCOR and Rayleigh atmospheric correction methods on Sentinel-3 OLCI images for a shallow eutrophic reservoir,"Remote sensing of inland waters is challenging, but also important, due to the need to monitor the ever-increasing harmful algal blooms (HABs), which have serious effects on water quality. The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) of the Sentinel-3 satellites program is capable of providing images for the monitoring of such waters. Atmospheric correction is a necessary process in order to retrieve the desired surface-leaving radiance signal and several atmospheric correction methods have been developed through the years. However, many of these correction methods require programming language skills, or function as commercial software plugins, limiting their possibility of use by end users. Accordingly, in this study, the free SNAP software provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to evaluate the possible differences between a partial atmospheric correction method accounting for Rayleigh scattering and a full atmospheric correction method (iCOR), applied on Sentinel-3 OLCI images of a shallow, highly eutrophic water reservoir. For the complete evaluation of the two methods, in addition to the comparison of the band reflectance values, chlorophyll (CHL) and cyanobacteria (CI) indices were also calculated and their values were intercompared. The results showed, that although the absolute values between the two correction methods did not coincide, there was a very good correlation between the two methods for both bands’ reflectance (r > 0.73) and the CHL and CI indices values (r > 0.95). Therefore, since iCOR correction image processing time is 25 times longer than Rayleigh correction, it is proposed that the Rayleigh partial correction method may be alternatively used for seasonal water monitoring, especially in cases of long time-series, enhancing time and resources use efficiency. Further comparisons of the two methods in other inland water bodies and evaluation with in situ chlorophyll and cyanobacteria measurements will enhance the applicability of the methodology.",2022,2022-11-04 00:00:00,4.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca24992933a93aad400eaffa4c4ee9e2297aa3a8
10.1071/mf21081,Climate change and cyanobacteria harmful algae blooms: adaptation practices for developing countries,"Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are increasingly being reported worldwide owing to several reasons, including widespread eutrophication and enhanced scientific monitoring. Catchment and water management, organisations, industry, farmers and local governments are all confronting the effects of climate change, which stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria and affect the efficacy of adaptation measures in water systems. To tackle climate change and CyanoHABs growth, actors at different levels require both ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ assessments to help them in formulating and implementing adaptation measures. Potential solutions must also be assessed locally to limit associated adverse effects, in particular, negative effects on water quality. Thus, having a better understanding of the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between adaptation practices and climate-change effects on CyanoHABs makes a valuable contribution to a more integrated climate policy and the effective climate-proofing of our water bodies. This article examines adaptation practices focused on tackling CyanoHABs occurrence in a changing climate. It fills an important gap between a major environmental problem and potential solutions. The practices and measures advanced as a result of the analysis can be used by persons with different expertise and skill levels for improving the relevant institutional frameworks and policies to protect their local water bodies.",2021,2021-08-26 00:00:00,8.0,111.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4cc2b4dac85c7523287e4c86eb6fb1ecf5abb4da

10.3390/life4040988,Mitigating Harmful Cyanobacterial Blooms in a Human- and Climatically-Impacted World,"Bloom-forming harmful cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs) are harmful from environmental, ecological and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, creating low oxygen conditions (hypoxia, anoxia), and by producing cyanotoxins. Cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence, global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. CyanoHABs are regulated by synergistic effects of nutrient (nitrogen:N and phosphorus:P) supplies, light, temperature, vertical stratification, water residence times, and biotic interactions. In most instances, nutrient control strategies should focus on reducing both N and P inputs. Strategies based on physical, chemical (nutrient) and biological manipulations can be effective in reducing CyanoHABs; however, these strategies are largely confined to relatively small systems, and some are prone to ecological and environmental drawbacks, including enhancing release of cyanotoxins, disruption of planktonic and benthic communities and fisheries habitat. All strategies should consider and be adaptive to climatic variability and change in order to be effective for long-term control of CyanoHABs. Rising temperatures and greater hydrologic variability will increase growth rates and alter critical nutrient thresholds for CyanoHAB development; thus, nutrient reductions for bloom control may need to be more aggressively pursued in response to climatic changes globally.",2014,2014-12-01 00:00:00,252.0,120.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2eb9d8b4755edee5d0db8fbb5720bca518d20de3

The performance of these intelligent systems is based on information transfer in the context of information technology, so reported data from network should be managed to avoid the malicious activities that including the issues that could affect the quality of service the system. In this paper for control of the reported data and to ensure the veracity of the obtained information, using intrusion detection system is proposed based on the support vector machine and principle component analysis (PCA) to recognize and identify the intrusions and attacks in the smart grid. Here, the operation of intrusion detection systems for different kernel of SVM when using support vector machine (SVM) and PCA simultaneously is studied. To evaluate the algorithm, based on data KDD99, numerical simulation is done on five different kernels for an intrusion detection system using support vector machine with PCA simultaneously. Also comparison analysis is investigated for presented intrusion detection algorithm in terms of time - response, rate of increase network efficiency and increase system error and differences in the use or lack of use PCA.

Recently, as deep learning models have become more common, RNNs have been used to forecast increasingly complicated systems. Dynamical spatio-temporal processes represent a class of complex systems that can potentially benefit from these types of models. Although the RNN literature is expansive and highly developed, uncertainty quantification is often ignored. Even when considered, the uncertainty is generally quantified without the use of a rigorous framework, such as a fully Bayesian setting. Here we attempt to quantify uncertainty in a more formal framework while maintaining the forecast accuracy that makes these models appealing, by presenting a Bayesian RNN model for nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting. Additionally, we make simple modifications to the basic RNN to help accommodate the unique nature of nonlinear spatio-temporal data. The proposed model is applied to a Lorenz simulation and two real-world nonlinear spatio-temporal forecasting applications.",2017,2017-11-02 00:00:00,96.0,70.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca625e2bfed10069873f5bbd314836fe05fa1eb7

However, the intermittent and unstable nature of PM2.5 concentration series makes its forecasting become a very difficult task. In order to improve the forecast accuracy of PM2.5 concentration, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on wavelet transform (WT), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and back propagation (BP) neural network optimized by differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Firstly, WT is employed to disassemble the PM2.5 concentration series into a number of subsets with different frequencies. Secondly, VMD is applied to decompose each subset into a set of variational modes (VMs). Thirdly, DE-BP model is utilized to forecast all the VMs. Fourthly, the forecast value of each subset is obtained through aggregating the forecast results of all the VMs obtained from VMD decomposition of this subset. Finally, the final forecast series of PM2.5 concentration is obtained by adding up the forecast values of all subsets. Two PM2.5 concentration series collected from Wuhan and Tianjin, respectively, located in China are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms all the other considered models in this paper.",2017,2017-07-01 00:00:00,33.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1ea839f94c1a492baa80ac39bf0a5885b0e789e

Patients with LABC from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiomics features were extracted from enhanced MRI. We constructed the radiomics score using lasso and assessed its prognostic value. An external validation cohort from The Cancer Imaging Archive was used to assess phenotype reproducibility. Sequencing data from TCGA and our center were applied to reveal genomic landscape of different radiomics score groups. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes map and bioinformatics methods were applied to evaluate the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment. Computational histopathology was also applied. A total of 278 patients were divided into training cohort and validation cohort. Radiomics score was constructed and significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients in training cohort, validation cohort and external validation cohort (p < 0.001, p = 0.014 and p = 0.041, respectively). The radiomics-based nomogram showed better predictive performance of DFS compared with TNM model. Distinct gene expression patterns were identified. Immunophenotype and immune cell composition was different in each radiomics score group. The link between radiomics and computational histopathology was revealed. The radiomics score could effectively predict prognosis of LABC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

In this context, radiomics is an emerging approach for examining medical images and clinical data by capturing multiple features hidden from human eye and is potentially able to predict response assessment and survival in the course of immunotherapy. We reviewed the available studies investigating the role of radiomics in cancer patients, focusing on non-small cell lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although preliminary research shows encouraging results, different issues need to be solved before radiomics can enter into clinical practice. Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have demonstrated encouraging results in terms of durable clinical benefit and survival in several malignancies. Nevertheless, the search to identify an “ideal” biomarker for predicting response to ICI is still far from over. Radiomics is a new translational field of study aiming to extract, by dedicated software, several features from a given medical image, ranging from intensity distribution and spatial heterogeneity to higher-order statistical parameters. Based on these premises, our review aims to summarize the current status of radiomics as a potential predictor of clinical response following immunotherapy treatment. A comprehensive search of PubMed results was conducted. All studies published in English up to and including December 2021 were selected, comprising those that explored computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) for radiomic analyses in the setting of ICI. Several studies have demonstrated the potential applicability of radiomic features in the monitoring of the therapeutic response beyond the traditional morphologic and metabolic criteria, as well as in the prediction of survival or non-invasive assessment of the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, important limitations emerge from our review in terms of standardization in feature selection, data sharing, and methods, as well as in external validation. Additionally, there is still need for prospective clinical trials to confirm the potential significant role of radiomics during immunotherapy.",2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,18.0,68.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/874c5fc805f90d50caf7a7a258c777db1f24d922

A prior validation of the immunoscore for breast cancer (ISBC) was made on the basis of a systematic assessment of immune landscapes extrapolated from a large number of neoplastic transcripts. Our goal was to develop a non-invasive radiomics-based ISBC predictive factor. Methods Immunocell fractions of 22 different categories were evaluated using CIBERSORT on the basis of a large, open breast cancer cohort derived from comprehensive information on gene expression. The ISBC was constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model derived from the Immunocell type scores, with 479 quantified features in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions as observed from DCE-MRI. A radiomics signature [radiomics ImmunoScore (RIS)] was developed for the prediction of ISBC using a random forest machine-learning algorithm, and we further evaluated its relationship with prognosis. Results An ISBC consisting of seven different immune cells was established through the use of a LASSO model. Multivariate analyses showed that the ISBC was an independent risk factor in prognosis (HR=2.42, with a 95% CI of 1.49–3.93; P<0.01). A radiomic signature of 21 features of the ISBC was then exploited and validated (the areas under the curve [AUC] were 0.899 and 0.815). We uncovered statistical associations between the RIS signature with recurrence-free and overall survival rates (both P<0.05). Conclusions The RIS is a valuable instrument with which to assess the immunoscore, and offers important implications for the prognosis of breast cancer.",2022,2022-01-03 00:00:00,29.0,38.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbb601d194933864c61fbea787ba526401a172f9

10.3390/cancers13246273,Assessing PD-L1 Expression Status Using Radiomic Features from Contrast-Enhanced Breast MRI in Breast Cancer Patients: Initial Results,"Simple Summary To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing radiomics coupled with machine learning from MRI-derived features to predict PD-L1 expression status in biopsy-proven triple negative breast cancers and comparing the performance of this approach with the performance of qualitative assessment by two radiologists. This pilot study shows that radiomics analysis coupled with machine learning of DCE-MRI is a promising approach to derive prognostic and predictive information and to select patients who could benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. This technique could also be used to monitor PD-L1 expression, as it can vary over time and between different regions of the tumor, thus avoiding repeated biopsies. Abstract The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess whether radiomics analysis coupled with machine learning (ML) based on standard-of-care dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can predict PD-L1 expression status in patients with triple negative breast cancer, and to compare the performance of this approach with radiologist review. Patients with biopsy-proven triple negative breast cancer who underwent pre-treatment breast MRI and whose PD-L1 status was available were included. Following 3D tumor segmentation and extraction of radiomic features, radiomic features with significant differences between PD-L1+ and PD-L1− patients were determined, and a final predictive model to predict PD-L1 status was developed using a coarse decision tree and five-fold cross-validation. Separately, all lesions were qualitatively assessed by two radiologists independently according to the BI-RADS lexicon. Of 62 women (mean age 47, range 31–81), 27 had PD-L1− tumors and 35 had PD-L1+ tumors. The final radiomics model to predict PD-L1 status utilized three MRI parameters, i.e., variance (FO), run length variance (RLM), and large zone low grey level emphasis (LZLGLE), for a sensitivity of 90.7%, specificity of 85.1%, and diagnostic accuracy of 88.2%. There were no significant associations between qualitative assessed DCE-MRI imaging features and PD-L1 status. Thus, radiomics analysis coupled with ML based on standard-of-care DCE-MRI is a promising approach to derive prognostic and predictive information and to select patients who could benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.",2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,16.0,52.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb1937301fc74926c4b6031c42cf9791de4e026e
10.3390/diagnostics11081491,Radiomics Nomogram Based on Radiomics Score from Multiregional Diffusion-Weighted MRI and Clinical Factors for Evaluating HER-2 2+ Status of Breast Cancer,"This study aimed to establish and validate a radiomics nomogram using the radiomics score (rad-score) based on multiregional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) features combined with clinical factors for evaluating HER-2 2+ status of breast cancer. A total of 223 patients were retrospectively included. Radiomic features were extracted from multiregional DWI and ADC images. Based on the intratumoral, peritumoral, and combined regions, three rad-scores were calculated using the logistic regression model. Independent parameters were selected among clinical factors and combined rad-score (com-rad-score) using multivariate logistic analysis and used to construct a radiomics nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated using calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUCs) of intratumoral and peritumoral rad-scores were 0.824/0.763 and 0.794/0.731 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Com-rad-score achieved the highest AUC (0.860/0.790) among three rad-scores. ER status and com-rad-score were selected to establish the nomogram, which yielded good discrimination (AUC: 0.883/0.848) and calibration. Decision curve analysis demonstrated the clinical value of the nomogram in the validation cohort. In conclusion, radiomics nomogram, including clinical factors and com-rad-score, showed favorable performance for evaluating HER-2 2+ status in breast cancer.",2021,2021-08-01 00:00:00,15.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d5ebe4bf1d351445801404b44fca52a69b033f90
10.1186/s13045-021-01103-4,Spatial architecture of the immune microenvironment orchestrates tumor immunity and therapeutic response,"Tumors are not only aggregates of malignant cells but also well-organized complex ecosystems. The immunological components within tumors, termed the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), have long been shown to be strongly related to tumor development, recurrence and metastasis. However, conventional studies that underestimate the potential value of the spatial architecture of the TIME are unable to completely elucidate its complexity. As innovative high-flux and high-dimensional technologies emerge, researchers can more feasibly and accurately detect and depict the spatial architecture of the TIME. These findings have improved our understanding of the complexity and role of the TIME in tumor biology. In this review, we first epitomized some representative emerging technologies in the study of the spatial architecture of the TIME and categorized the description methods used to characterize these structures. Then, we determined the functions of the spatial architecture of the TIME in tumor biology and the effects of the gradient of extracellular nonspecific chemicals (ENSCs) on the TIME. We also discussed the potential clinical value of our understanding of the spatial architectures of the TIME, as well as current limitations and future prospects in this novel field. This review will bring spatial architectures of the TIME, an emerging dimension of tumor ecosystem research, to the attention of more researchers and promote its application in tumor research and clinical practice.",2021,2021-06-25 00:00:00,270.0,217.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36d08caeba9c8a7633df3ed0a6a14e2c2b876b30
10.2147/JHC.S309570,Peritumoral Dilation Radiomics of Gadoxetate Disodium-Enhanced MRI Excellently Predicts Early Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma without Macrovascular Invasion After Hepatectomy,"Background Whether peritumoral dilation radiomics can excellently predict early recrudescence (≤2 years) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods Between March 2012 and June 2018, 323 pathologically confirmed HCC patients without macrovascular invasion, who underwent liver resection and preoperative gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) MRI, were consecutively recruited into this study. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent clinicoradiologic predictors of 2-year recrudescence. Peritumoral dilation (tumor and peritumoral zones within 1cm) radiomics extracted features from 7-sequence images for modeling and achieved average but robust predictive performance through 5-fold cross validation. Independent clinicoradiologic predictors were then incorporated with the radiomics model for constructing a comprehensive nomogram. The predictive discrimination was quantified with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Results With the median recurrence-free survival (RFS) reaching 60.43 months, 28.2% (91/323) and 16.4% (53/323) patients suffered from early and delay relapse, respectively. Microvascular invasion, tumor size >5 cm, alanine aminotransferase >50 U/L, γ-glutamyltransferase >60 U/L, prealbumin ≤250 mg/L, and peritumoral enhancement independently impaired 2-year RFS in the clinicoradiologic model with AUC of 0.694 (95% CI 0.628–0.760). Nevertheless, these indexes were paucity of robustness (P >0.05) when integrating with 38 most recurrence-related radiomics signatures for developing the comprehensive nomogram. The peritumoral dilation radiomics—the ultimate prediction model yielded satisfactory mean AUCs (training cohort: 0.939, 95% CI 0.908–0.973; validation cohort: 0.842, 95% CI 0.736–0.951) after 5-fold cross validation and fitted well with the actual relapse status in the calibration curve. Besides, our radiomics model obtained the best clinical net benefits, with significant improvements of NRI (35.9%-66.1%, P <0.001) versus five clinical algorithms: the clinicoradiologic model, the tumor-node-metastasis classification, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, the preoperative and postoperative risks of Early Recurrence After Surgery for Liver tumor. Conclusion Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI-based peritumoral dilation radiomics is a potential preoperative biomarker for early recurrence of HCC patients without macrovascular invasion.",2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,34.0,68.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a95a5e1ee517e8994f6570b1d3b1bb3e2030ef0a

Thus, new anti-ASFV drugs need to be urgently identified. Recently, we identified pentagastrin as a potential antiviral drug against ASFVs using molecular docking and machine learning models. However, the scoring functions are easily influenced by properties of protein pockets, resulting in a scoring bias. Here, we employed the 5′-P binding pocket of AsfvPolX as a potential binding site to identify antiviral drugs and classified 13 AsfvPolX structures into three classes based on pocket parameters calculated by the SiteMap module. We then applied principal component analysis to eliminate this scoring bias, which was effective in making the SP Glide score more balanced between 13 AsfvPolX structures in the dataset. As a result, we identified cangrelor and fostamatinib as potential antiviral drugs against ASFVs. Furthermore, the classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein can provide an alternative approach to identify novel antiviral drugs by optimizing the scoring function of the docking programs. Here, we report a machine learning-based novel approach to generate high binding affinity compounds that are individually matched to the available classification of the pocket properties of AsfvPolX protein.",2021,2021-12-01 00:00:00,6.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e77c20cd0807b026fb60afd7725547425720857f
10.3390/v13112124,Structures and Functional Diversities of ASFV Proteins,"African swine fever virus (ASFV), the causative pathogen of the recent ASF epidemic, is a highly contagious double-stranded DNA virus. Its genome is in the range of 170~193 kbp and encodes 68 structural proteins and over 100 non-structural proteins. Its high pathogenicity strains cause nearly 100% mortality in swine. Consisting of four layers of protein shells and an inner genome, its structure is obviously more complicated than many other viruses, and its multi-layered structures play different kinds of roles in ASFV replication and survival. Each layer possesses many proteins, but very few of the proteins have been investigated at a structural level. Here, we concluded all the ASFV proteins whose structures were unveiled, and explained their functions from the view of structures. Those structures include ASFV AP endonuclease, dUTPases (E165R), pS273R protease, core shell proteins p15 and p35, non-structural proteins pA151R, pNP868R (RNA guanylyltransferase), major capsid protein p72 (gene B646L), Bcl-2-like protein A179L, histone-like protein pA104R, sulfhydryl oxidase pB119L, polymerase X and ligase.

Currently known flavonoids with anti-ASFV activity demonstrate a wide range of antiviral mechanisms, which motivates exploration of new antiviral candidates within this class. The objective of this study was to determine whether other flavonoids may significantly inhibit ASFV infection in vitro. We performed a cell-based library screen of 90 flavonoids. Our screening method allowed us to track the development of virus-induced cytopathic effect by MTT in the presence of tested flavonoids. This screening method was shown to be robust for hit identification, with an average Z-factor of 0.683. We identified nine compounds that inhibit ASFV Ba71V strain in Vero cells. Among them, kaempferol was the most potent and exhibited dose-dependent inhibition, which occurred through a virostatic effect. Time-of-addition studies revealed that kaempferol acts on the entry and post-entry stages of the ASFV replication cycle and impairs viral protein and DNA synthesis. It was further identified that kaempferol induces autophagy in ASFV-infected Vero cells, which is related to its antiviral activity and could be partially abrogated by the addition of an autophagy inhibitor. Kaempferol also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of a highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate in porcine macrophages. Together, these findings support that kaempferol is a promising anti-ASFV agent and has a distinct antiviral mechanism compared to other anti-ASFV flavonoids.",2021,2021-10-21 00:00:00,31.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36caa5bf1e64ea55b4632b6bdd76ec3031cca7a6

The mortality rate of the most acute and acute ASF infection is almost 100%. The World Organization for Animal Health [Office International des épizooties (OIE)] lists it as a legally reported animal disease and China lists it as class I animal epidemic. Since the first diagnosed ASF case in China on August 3, 2018, it has caused huge economic losses to animal husbandry. ASF is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), which is the only member of Asfarviridae family. ASFV is and the only insect-borne DNA virus belonging to the Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) family with an icosahedral structure and an envelope. Till date, there are still no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs for the prevention or treatment of ASF. The complex viral genome and its sophisticated ability to regulate the host immune response may be the reason for the difficulty in developing an effective vaccine. This review summarizes the recent findings on ASFV structure, the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection and immunosuppression, and ASFV-encoded proteins to provide comprehensive proteomic information for basic research on ASFV. In addition, it also analyzes the results of previous studies and speculations on the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection, which aids the study of the mechanism of clinical pathological phenomena, and provides a possible direction for an intensive study of ASFV infection mechanism. By summarizing the findings on molecular mechanism of ASFV- regulated host cell immune response, this review provides orientations and ideas for fundamental research on ASFV and provides a theoretical basis for the development of protective vaccines against ASFV.",2021,2021-09-06 00:00:00,104.0,92.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8a3a0c5275b158456f72c750baa7ffdc7e0c900

Although the virus is harmless to humans, the ongoing ASFV epidemic could have severe economic consequences for global food security. Recent studies have found a few antiviral agents that can inhibit ASFV infections. However, currently, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify new drugs to treat ASFV. Based on the structural information data on the targets of ASFV, we used molecular docking and machine learning models to identify novel antiviral agents. We confirmed that compounds with high affinity present in the region of interest belonged to subsets in the chemical space using principal component analysis and k-means clustering in molecular docking studies of FDA-approved drugs. These methods predicted pentagastrin as a potential antiviral drug against ASFVs. Finally, it was also observed that the compound had an inhibitory effect on AsfvPolX activity.

Unfortunately, there is currently no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein–protein interactions between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of protein–protein interactions from multiple sources. Thirty-eight swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as ASFV-interacting swine proteins. The ASFV-interacting swine proteins were found to play a central role in the swine protein–protein interaction network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of ASFV-interacting swine proteins also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on ASFV-interacting swine proteins were identified, such as Polaprezinc and Geldanamycin. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulation showed that Geldanamycin could bind with swine HSP90AB1 stably.

In this work, we show how deep learning can be used to advance the research field of photochemistry by learning all important properties—multiple energies, forces, and different couplings—for photodynamics simulations. We simplify such simulations substantially by (i) a phase-free training skipping costly preprocessing of raw quantum chemistry data; (ii) rotationally covariant nonadiabatic couplings, which can either be trained or (iii) alternatively be approximated from only ML potentials, their gradients, and Hessians; and (iv) incorporating spin–orbit couplings. As the deep-learning method, we employ SchNet with its automatically determined representation of molecular structures and extend it for multiple electronic states.

10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16702,Hindsight and Sequential Rationality of Correlated Play,"Driven by recent successes in two-player, zero-sum game solving and playing, artificial intelligence work on games has increasingly focused on algorithms that produce equilibrium-based strategies. However, this approach has been less effective at producing competent players in general-sum games or those with more than two players than in two-player, zero-sum games. An appealing alternative is to consider adaptive algorithms that ensure strong performance in hindsight relative to what could have been achieved with modified behavior. This approach also leads to a game-theoretic analysis, but in the correlated play that arises from joint learning dynamics rather than factored agent behavior at equilibrium. We develop and advocate for this hindsight rationality framing of learning in general sequential decision-making settings. To this end, we re-examine mediated equilibrium and deviation types in extensive-form games, thereby gaining a more complete understanding and resolving past misconceptions. We present a set of examples illustrating the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each type of equilibrium in the literature, and prove that no tractable concept subsumes all others. This line of inquiry culminates in the definition of the deviation and equilibrium classes that correspond to algorithms in the counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) family, relating them to all others in the literature. Examining CFR in greater detail further leads to a new recursive definition of rationality in correlated play that extends sequential rationality in a way that naturally applies to hindsight evaluation.",2020,2020-12-10 00:00:00,26.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/886ed15d25615e51dff6c453c116a0b394d332ee

However, the pervasiveness of web browsing in our daily life does not come without security risks. This widespread practice of web browsing in combination with web users’ low situational awareness against cyber attacks, exposes them to a variety of threats, such as phishing, malware and profiling. Phishing attacks can compromise a target, individual or enterprise, through social interaction alone. Moreover, in the current threat landscape phishing attacks typically serve as an attack vector or initial step in a more complex campaign. To make matters worse, past work has demonstrated the inability of denylists, which are the default phishing countermeasure, to protect users from the dynamic nature of phishing URLs. In this context, our work uses supervised machine learning to block phishing attacks, based on a novel combination of features that are extracted solely from the URL. We evaluate our performance over time with a dataset which consists of active phishing attacks and compare it with Google Safe Browsing (GSB), i.e., the default security control in most popular web browsers. We find that our work outperforms GSB in all of our experiments, as well as performs well even against phishing URLs which are active one year after our model’s training.",2021,2021-06-13 00:00:00,39.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ecff4b51c63a7cf6fd1d6379a117292a3c1bfa5c
10.3389/fcomp.2021.563060,Phishing Attacks: A Recent Comprehensive Study and a New Anatomy,"With the significant growth of internet usage, people increasingly share their personal information online. As a result, an enormous amount of personal information and financial transactions become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Phishing is an example of a highly effective form of cybercrime that enables criminals to deceive users and steal important data. Since the first reported phishing attack in 1990, it has been evolved into a more sophisticated attack vector. At present, phishing is considered one of the most frequent examples of fraud activity on the Internet. Phishing attacks can lead to severe losses for their victims including sensitive information, identity theft, companies, and government secrets. This article aims to evaluate these attacks by identifying the current state of phishing and reviewing existing phishing techniques. Studies have classified phishing attacks according to fundamental phishing mechanisms and countermeasures discarding the importance of the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing. This article proposes a new detailed anatomy of phishing which involves attack phases, attacker’s types, vulnerabilities, threats, targets, attack mediums, and attacking techniques. Moreover, the proposed anatomy will help readers understand the process lifecycle of a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of these phishing attacks and the techniques being used; also, it helps in developing a holistic anti-phishing system.

The financial sector is the primary target of phishing, and there are many different approaches to combat phishing attacks. Software-based detection approaches are more prominent in phishing detection; however, still, there is no robust solution that can stable for a long period. The primary purpose of this paper is to propose a novel solution to detect phishing attacks using a combined model of LSTM and CNN deep networks with the use of both URLs and HTML pages. The URLs are learned using an LSTM network with 1D convolutional, and another 1D convolutional network is used to learn the HTML features. These two networks were trained separately and combined through a sigmoid layer by dropping the last layer of each model to have the proposed model. The proposed model reached 98.34% in terms of accuracy, and that is above the previously recorded highest accuracy of 97.3% among the detection models used both URL and HTML features in the explored literature. The solution requires feature extraction only with HTML pages, and URLs were directly fed with a minimum pre-processing. Although the proposed solution uses extracted HTML features, those do not depend on third-party services. Therefore, an efficient real-time application can be implemented using the proposed model to detect phishing attacks to safeguard Internet users.",2020,2020-07-01 00:00:00,16.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0b3ed9172c5c011cd578b895fed056e28fa20da

Phishing includes sending a user an email, or causing a phishing page to steal personal information from a user. Blacklist-based detection techniques can detect this form of attack; however, these approaches have certain limitations, and the number of people affecting have continued to grow. The aim of a technique for phishing detection using machine learning to identify each URL into either a legitimate URL or a phished URL. Data availability here in this proposed solution is the key to executing the solution and if there is any issue with data availability it can cost the project accuracy. Data used for model testing must be reliable and appropriate to almost identify all the websites that the user wants to check. Model consistency is another factor that may trigger project failure so the model has to be accurate in determining a true identity of URLs. This technique employs features of a standardized resource locator (URL). The features have been defined which contain URLs for the phishing site. The suggested approach employs certain characteristics to detect phishing. The strategy was tested with a data collection of 3,000 URLs for the phishing site and 3,000 valid URLs for the site. The findings show that more than 90 percent of phishing sites can be identified by the proposed technique",2020,2020-05-30 00:00:00,1.0,27.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5efe81c383a4601a654ac9724371d694a75e8278

Based on observations from four monitoring wells, the persistence and periodicities of the loose porous aquifers, and the interrelation between precipitation and groundwater levels was examined based on a number of tools including autocorrelation, cross-correlation, spectral analysis, and wavelet transform. The results show that the groundwater levels at W1 and W2 present a downward trend while those at W3 and W4 show an upward trend. The dominant time period increases from 2.1 years (upstream) to 3.7 years (downstream). The time lags between aquifers and rainfall at W1, W2, W3 and W4 are 139.14 ± 59.76 days (2008–2020), 23.27 ± 12.03 days (2005–2014), 145.01 ± 68.00 days (2007–2020), and 59.22 ± 26.14 days (2005–2019), respectively. The lags for the pumping years are 1.2~2.1 times of those during the years without pumping. The recharge ratio overestimated by the water table fluctuation method decreases from 0.32 at W2 to 0.17 at W4, suggesting that the site W2 has a good potentiality for groundwater recharge.

It is an important factor in managing and sustaining the groundwater resources that are used for drinking water, irrigation, and other purposes. Groundwater level prediction is a critical aspect of water resource management and requires accurate and efficient modelling techniques. This study reviews the most commonly used conventional numerical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting GWL. Significant advancements have been made in terms of prediction efficiency over the last two decades. However, while researchers have primarily focused on predicting monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly GWL, water managers and strategists require multi-year GWL simulations to take effective steps towards ensuring the sustainable supply of groundwater. In this paper, we consider a collection of state-of-the-art theories to develop and design a novel methodology and improve modelling efficiency in this field of evaluation. We examined 109 research articles published from 2008 to 2022 that investigated different modelling techniques. Finally, we concluded that machine learning and deep learning approaches are efficient for modelling GWL. Moreover, we provide possible future research directions and recommendations to enhance the accuracy of GWL prediction models and improve relevant understanding.",2023,2023-02-20 00:00:00,41.0,108.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f10f08144948ca306a21cd992020fef016e7c689

Identifying risk markers through easily accessible clinical data could help in the initial triage of COVID-19 patients and anticipate a fatal outcome, especially in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged regions. This study aims to identify markers that increase lethality risk in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, based on machine learning (ML) methods. Markers were differentiated by sex and age-group. Methods A total of 11,564 cases of COVID-19 in Mexico were extracted from the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease. Four ML classification methods were trained to predict lethality, and an interpretability approach was used to identify those markers. Results Models based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) yielded the best performance in a test set. This model achieved a sensitivity of 0.91, a specificity of 0.69, a positive predictive value of 0.344, and a negative predictive value of 0.965. For female patients, the leading markers are diabetes and arthralgia. For males, the main markers are chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chest pain. Dyspnea, hypertension, and polypnea increased the risk of death in both sexes. Conclusions ML-based models using an interpretability approach successfully identified risk markers for lethality by sex and age. Our results indicate that age is the strongest demographic factor for a fatal outcome, while all other markers were consistent with previous clinical trials conducted in a Mexican population.

The changes in water levels directly affect the circulation processes of lakes and rivers that control water mixing and bottom sediment resuspension, further affecting water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Thus, these considerations have made the water level monitoring process essential to save the environment. Machine learning hybrid models are emerging robust tools that are successfully applied for water level monitoring. Various models have been developed, and selecting the optimal model would be a lengthy procedure. A timely, detailed, and instructive overview of the models’ concepts and historical uses would be beneficial in preventing researchers from overlooking models’ potential selection and saving significant time on the problem. Thus, recent research on water level prediction using hybrid machines is reviewed in this article to present the “state of the art” on the subject and provide some suggestions on research methodologies and models. This comprehensive study classifies hybrid models into four types algorithm parameter optimisation-based hybrid models (OBH), pre-processing-based hybrid models (PBH), the components combination-based hybrid models (CBH), and hybridisation of parameter optimisation-based with preprocessing-based hybrid models (HOPH); furthermore, it explains the pre-processing of data in detail.

10.1007/s10040-022-02549-7,"Evaluation of water-level trends in the Mimbres Basin, southwest New Mexico (USA), using spatiotemporal kriging","Groundwater-level trends over the past 40 years in the Mimbres Basin of southwest New Mexico (USA) were characterized with sequential water-level maps and maps of water-level change generated via spatiotemporal kriging. In the region of the most abundant irrigated agriculture, water levels have declined up to 24 m and cones of depression have expanded greatly. Increases in area of irrigated land and groundwater withdrawals in the past 10 years are coeval with water-level declines near the USA-Mexico border. Known areas of groundwater recharge from streamflow infiltration, and springs discharging deep-sourced water, show evidence of net water-level rises in the past 40 years, but declines in the last 10 years, in concert with declining precipitation over the basin. Formerly irrigated lands exhibit water-level rises, suggestive of flattening of cones of depression after cessation of extensive groundwater pumping. Manual water-level measurements are vital for understanding and managing groundwater resources, yet they are expensive and laborious to collect, which has resulted in much fewer data in recent years. Spatiotemporal kriging is more complex in mathematical development and implementation than spatial kriging, but it yields improved precision and accuracy, predictions at times with no data as well as at locations with no data, and fewer artifacts due to changing well networks. Its ability to leverage historical data recommends its use in hydrologic studies dependent on water-level maps and changes in water levels over time.",2022,2022-10-10 00:00:00,5.0,65.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57822d1d064f82c4745981f0d8efe50cb19f1fb8
10.3390/fi14090259,Mathematical and Machine Learning Models for Groundwater Level Changes: A Systematic Review and Bibliographic Analysis,"With the effects of climate change such as increasing heat, higher rainfall, and more recurrent extreme weather events including storms and floods, a unique approach to studying the effects of climatic elements on groundwater level variations is required. These unique approaches will help people make better decisions. Researchers and stakeholders can attain these goals if they become familiar with current machine learning and mathematical model approaches to predicting groundwater level changes. However, descriptions of machine learning and mathematical model approaches for forecasting groundwater level changes are lacking. This study picked 117 papers from the Scopus scholarly database to address this knowledge gap. In a systematic review, the publications were examined using quantitative and qualitative approaches, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was chosen as the reporting format. Machine learning and mathematical model techniques have made significant contributions to predicting groundwater level changes, according to the study. However, the domain is skewed because machine learning has been more popular in recent years, with random forest (RF) methods dominating, followed by the methods of support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Machine learning ensembles have also been found to help with aspects of computational complexity, such as performance and training times. Furthermore, compared to mathematical model techniques, machine learning approaches achieve higher accuracies, according to our research. As a result, it is advised that academics employ new machine learning techniques while also considering mathematical model approaches to predicting groundwater level changes.",2022,2022-08-30 00:00:00,45.0,102.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4512e5d54e12be05e05f4567ff3f3fc9dd6d1150
10.2166/ws.2022.297,Geographic information system and multi-criteria decision analysis for the determination of groundwater recharge potential: systematic review,"
 The groundwater recharge area is one of the crucial components in regional development. Many studies in determining groundwater recharge areas with a combination of Geographic Information System and Multi-criteria Decision Analysis have been carried out. The development of studies over the last ten years is reviewed in this paper using the PRISMA systematic review method to find out the study's progress. A total of 31 studies were found in the previous ten years based on the review results. Information about the country of origin of the study, dominant geology, climatic conditions, criteria used, decision-making and weighting methods, and the validation process for each study were extracted. The results show 12 countries researching this topic, with five dominant geological classes and nine classes of climatic conditions, 33 criteria are used in the 2011–2021 range with eight dominant criteria used. Four decision rules, and the weighted method are used, and a validation process is commonly used the well data. From systematic review and meta analysis, we conclude: India has become the most country researched this topic. Hard rock class geology dominant and arid and semi-arid climate conditions become the most focused studies. Variability of criteria up to 33 with 18 criteria still used only once in each study, and eight dominant criteria have been used. AHP and MIF have become the most used method for asigned weight, and FR is the newest method for assigned weight. Lithology has the highest weight compared to the other seven dominant criteria, and the well data has become the most common data for verification of groundwater recharge.",2022,2022-08-13 00:00:00,7.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2461f2e6b08496f3538f90d67af2b41f0c54430

In particular, we propose a strategy to probe the anomalous $h Z_{\mu \nu}Z^{\mu \nu}$ and $h Z_{\mu \nu}\tilde{Z}^{\mu \nu}$ vertices at the percent level. We show that this can achieved by resurrecting the interference term between the transverse $Zh$ amplitude, which receives contributions from the above couplings, and the dominant SM longitudinal amplitude. These contributions are hard to isolate without a knowledge of the analytical amplitude, as they vanish unless the process is studied differentially in three different angular variables at the level of the $Z$-decay products. By also including the differential distributions with respect to energy variables, we obtain projected bounds for the two other tensor structures of the Higgs coupling to $Z$-bosons.",2019,2019-05-07 00:00:00,26.0,86.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c0175dcb06cafe76cac418aabf90016c6bce60c

This classifier exploits the “history tree” of how the measured data point might have evolved out of any simpler (reconstructed) points along classical paths, while explicitly keeping quantum–mechanical interference effects by copiously employing complete leading-order matrix elements. This approach extends the standard Matrix Element Method to an arbitrary number of final state objects and to exclusive final states where reconstructed objects can be collinear or soft. We have implemented this method into the standalone package hytrees and have applied it to Higgs boson production in association with two jets, with subsequent decay into photons. hytrees allows to construct an optimal classifier to discriminate this process from large Standard Model backgrounds.

10.1186/s12911-017-0550-1,Supervised learning for infection risk inference using pathology data,"BackgroundAntimicrobial Resistance is threatening our ability to treat common infectious diseases and overuse of antimicrobials to treat human infections in hospitals is accelerating this process. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) have been proven to enhance quality of care by promoting change in prescription practices through antimicrobial selection advice. However, bypassing an initial assessment to determine the existence of an underlying disease that justifies the need of antimicrobial therapy might lead to indiscriminate and often unnecessary prescriptions.MethodsFrom pathology laboratory tests, six biochemical markers were selected and combined with microbiology outcomes from susceptibility tests to create a unique dataset with over one and a half million daily profiles to perform infection risk inference. Outliers were discarded using the inter-quartile range rule and several sampling techniques were studied to tackle the class imbalance problem. The first phase selects the most effective and robust model during training using ten-fold stratified cross-validation. The second phase evaluates the final model after isotonic calibration in scenarios with missing inputs and imbalanced class distributions.ResultsMore than 50% of infected profiles have daily requested laboratory tests for the six biochemical markers with very promising infection inference results: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.80-0.83), sensitivity (0.64-0.75) and specificity (0.92-0.97). Standardization consistently outperforms normalization and sensitivity is enhanced by using the SMOTE sampling technique. Furthermore, models operated without noticeable loss in performance if at least four biomarkers were available.ConclusionThe selected biomarkers comprise enough information to perform infection risk inference with a high degree of confidence even in the presence of incomplete and imbalanced data. Since they are commonly available in hospitals, Clinical Decision Support Systems could benefit from these findings to assist clinicians in deciding whether or not to initiate antimicrobial therapy to improve prescription practices.",2017,2017-12-08 00:00:00,38.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5bd0faf381cbf48773f3ced420808c6c0199edc0

10.1002/cai2.136,Explainable artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection and risk prediction: A systematic scoping review,"Abstract With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), data‐driven algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain. However, due to the nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision‐making by such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black‐box process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on peer‐reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets. Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top model‐agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage, explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model primarily explained tree‐based ensemble machine learning models. The most common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as tree‐based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability, fairness, and trustworthiness of AI‐enabled health systems and medical devices and, ultimately, the quality of care and outcomes.",2024,2024-07-03 00:00:00,8.0,146.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/305546cb41590a9566f8c812bb9a0537b598981b
10.1007/s00330-024-10740-5,ESR Essentials: screening for breast cancer - general recommendations by EUSOBI,"Abstract Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women accounting for about 30% of all new cancer cases and the incidence is constantly increasing. Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations, including underdiagnosis, false positive cases, and overdiagnosis. Indeed, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities, including digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, breast MRI, and, more recently, contrast-enhanced mammography, are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a “one-size-fits-all” approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening. Key Points Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available. Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening. Key recommendations Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach, regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35–40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available, ultrasound can be performed as an alternative, although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited. Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians.",2024,2024-04-24 00:00:00,9.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9dcfa595b6aadecc4f991939b3c59a358d6db1e0

Recent technological advances in breast cancer treatment offer hope to millions of women in the world. Segmentation of the breast’s Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is one of the necessary tasks in the diagnosis and detection of breast cancer. Currently, a popular deep learning model, U-Net is extensively used in biomedical image segmentation. This article aims to advance the state of the art and conduct a more in-depth analysis with a focus on the use of various U-Net models in lesion detection in women’s breast DCE-MRI. In this article, we perform an empirical study of the effectiveness and efficiency of U-Net and its derived deep learning models including ResUNet, Dense UNet, DUNet, Attention U-Net, UNet++, MultiResUNet, RAUNet, Inception U-Net and U-Net GAN for lesion detection in breast DCE-MRI. All the models are applied to the benchmarked 100 Sagittal T2-Weighted fat-suppressed DCE-MRI slices of 20 patients and their performance is compared. Also, a comparative study has been conducted with V-Net, W-Net, and DeepLabV3+. Non-parametric statistical test Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is used to analyze the significance of the quantitative results. Furthermore, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is used to evaluate overall performance focused on accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F $$_1$$ 1 -score, specificity, Geometric-Mean, DSC, and false-positive rate. The RAUNet segmentation model achieved a high accuracy of 99.76%, sensitivity of 85.04%, precision of 90.21%, and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.04% whereas ResNet achieved 99.62% accuracy, 62.26% sensitivity, 99.56% precision, and 72.86% DSC. ResUNet is found to be the most effective model based on MCDA. On the other hand, U-Net GAN takes the least computational time to perform the segmentation task.

10.1093/jamia/ocad133,Inferring cancer disease response from radiology reports using large language models with data augmentation and prompting,"Abstract Objective To assess large language models on their ability to accurately infer cancer disease response from free-text radiology reports. Materials and Methods We assembled 10 602 computed tomography reports from cancer patients seen at a single institution. All reports were classified into: no evidence of disease, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease. We applied transformer models, a bidirectional long short-term memory model, a convolutional neural network model, and conventional machine learning methods to this task. Data augmentation using sentence permutation with consistency loss as well as prompt-based fine-tuning were used on the best-performing models. Models were validated on a hold-out test set and an external validation set based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) classifications. Results The best-performing model was the GatorTron transformer which achieved an accuracy of 0.8916 on the test set and 0.8919 on the RECIST validation set. Data augmentation further improved the accuracy to 0.8976. Prompt-based fine-tuning did not further improve accuracy but was able to reduce the number of training reports to 500 while still achieving good performance. Discussion These models could be used by researchers to derive progression-free survival in large datasets. It may also serve as a decision support tool by providing clinicians an automated second opinion of disease response. Conclusions Large clinical language models demonstrate potential to infer cancer disease response from radiology reports at scale. Data augmentation techniques are useful to further improve performance. Prompt-based fine-tuning can significantly reduce the size of the training dataset.",2023,2023-07-14 00:00:00,17.0,33.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b84cb46a704cc3a978758d8bf09fff25ed71a5a

Secondly, subclasses were classified for the collected sample data. In this paper, Two Step Cluster Algorithm is used to divide the high potassium glass into four subclasses and the lead barium glass into five subclasses based on the Euclidean distance between the samples. Finally, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between chemical components are computed separately based on the proportion of each chemical component in glass to explore the correlation between them.",2023,2023-04-01 00:00:00,2.0,2.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/455e03a40cfe6f3bef57f4cd842fde3de93e72fd
10.3390/math11071650,Predictive Modeling of the Uniaxial Compressive Strength of Rocks Using an Artificial Neural Network Approach,"Sedimentary rocks provide information on previous environments on the surface of the Earth. As a result, they are the principal narrators of the former climate, life, and important events on the surface of the Earth. The complexity and cost of direct destructive laboratory tests adversely affect the data scarcity problem, making the development of intelligent indirect methods an integral step in attempts to address the problem faced by rock engineering projects. This study established an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to predict the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) in MPa of sedimentary rocks using different input parameters; i.e., dry density (ρd) in g/cm3, Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) in MPa, and wet density (ρwet) in g/cm3. The developed ANN models, M1, M2, and M3, were divided as follows: the overall dataset, 70% training dataset and 30% testing dataset, and 60% training dataset and 40% testing dataset, respectively. In addition, multiple linear regression (MLR) was performed for comparison to the proposed ANN models to verify the accuracy of the predicted values. The performance indices were also calculated by estimating the established models. The predictive performance of the M2 ANN model in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), variance accounts for (VAF), and a20-index was 0.831, 0.27672, 0.92, and 0.80, respectively, in the testing dataset, revealing ideal results, thus it was proposed as the best-fit prediction model for UCS of sedimentary rocks at the Thar coalfield, Pakistan, among the models developed in this study. Moreover, by performing a sensitivity analysis, it was determined that BTS was the most influential parameter in predicting UCS.",2023,2023-03-29 00:00:00,17.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34e6ee72e294c915f7218656fc779ec238bab019
10.3390/app13063718,Application of Support Vector Machine Algorithm Incorporating Slime Mould Algorithm Strategy in Ancient Glass Classification,"Glass products are important evidence of early East–West cultural exchanges. Ancient glass in China mostly consisted of lead glass, and potassium glass is widely believed to be imported abroad. In order to figure out the origin of glass artefacts, it is crucial to define the type of glass products accurately. In contemporary research on the chemical composition of ancient glass products, potassium glass is separated from lead glass primarily by the weight ratio of oxides or the proportion of lead-containing compounds. This approach can be excessively subjective and prone to mistakes while calculating the mass fraction of compounds containing potassium. So, it is better to find out the link between the proportion of glass’s chemical composition and its classifications during the weathering process of the glass products, to develop an effective classification model using machine learning techniques. In this research, we suggest employing the slime mould approach to optimise the parameters of a support vector machine and examine a 69-group glass chemical composition dataset. In addition, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared to those of commonly used classification models: decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and support vector machines optimised by genetic algorithms (GA-SVM). The results of this research indicated that the support vector machine method with the sticky slime mould algorithm strategy is the most effective. On the training set, 100% accuracy was attained, while on the test set, 97.50% accuracy was attained in this research. The research results demonstrate that the support vector machine algorithm combining the slime mould algorithm strategy is capable of providing a trustworthy classification reference for future glass artefacts.",2023,2023-03-14 00:00:00,16.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3291d5f8212a1e38afeb5efba6af06244befccba
10.3390/pr11010174,Research on Gas Concentration Prediction Based on the ARIMA-LSTM Combination Model,"The current single gas prediction model is not sufficient for identifying and processing all the characteristics of mine gas concentration time series data. This paper proposes an ARIMA-LSTM combined forecasting model based on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. In the ARIMA-LSTM model, the ARIMA model is used to process the historical data of gas time series and obtain the corresponding linear prediction results and residual series. The LSTM model is used in further analysis of the residual series, predicting the nonlinear factors in the residual series. The prediction results of the combined model are compared separately with those of the two single models. Finally, RMSE, MAPE and R2 are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the three models. The results of the study show that the metrics of the combined ARIMA-LSTM model are R2 = 0.9825, MAPE = 0.0124 and RMSE = 0.083. The combined model has the highest prediction accuracy and the lowest error and is more suitable for the predictive analysis of gas data. By comparing the prediction results of a single model and the combined model on gas time series data, the applicability, validity and scientificity of the combined model proposed in this paper are verified, which is of great importance to accurate prediction and early warning of underground gas danger in coal mines.",2023,2023-01-05 00:00:00,11.0,30.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8da2b038706241b3f30aef9027bdf116c0cac4a7

The convolutional neural network model was proposed to solve the classification problem, and the applicability of the convolutional algorithm in one-dimensional data was verified.Then, through the visualization of the chemical composition correlation of different categories of glass cultural relics, it is concluded that high-potassium glass has a strong correlation with silica, and lead-barium glass has a strong correlation with lead oxide.For the difference of chemical composition correlation between different types of glass cultural relics, the conclusion that silica in high-potassium glass is negatively correlated with other components was obtained by constructing knowledge map analysis.",2022,2022-12-07 00:00:00,2.0,11.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2780be62ce3f094bea2e5b5907d62c6e4f58380c
10.3390/bios12121181,Recent Development of Fluorescent Nanodiamonds for Optical Biosensing and Disease Diagnosis,"The ability to precisely monitor the intracellular temperature directly contributes to the essential understanding of biological metabolism, intracellular signaling, thermogenesis, and respiration. The intracellular heat generation and its measurement can also assist in the prediction of the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. However, intracellular thermometry without altering the biochemical reactions and cellular membrane damage is challenging, requiring appropriately biocompatible, nontoxic, and efficient biosensors. Bright, photostable, and functionalized fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) have emerged as excellent probes for intracellular thermometry and magnetometry with the spatial resolution on a nanometer scale. The temperature and magnetic field-dependent luminescence of naturally occurring defects in diamonds are key to high-sensitivity biosensing applications. Alterations in the surface chemistry of FNDs and conjugation with polymer, metallic, and magnetic nanoparticles have opened vast possibilities for drug delivery, diagnosis, nanomedicine, and magnetic hyperthermia. This study covers some recently reported research focusing on intracellular thermometry, magnetic sensing, and emerging applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedical imaging. We extend the application of FNDs as biosensors toward disease diagnosis by using intracellular, stationary, and time-dependent information.

10.3390/math10234523,Prediction of Strength Parameters of Thermally Treated Egyptian Granodiorite Using Multivariate Statistics and Machine Learning Techniques,"The mechanical properties of rocks, such as uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of intact rock, must be determined before any engineering project by employing lab or in situ tests. However, there are some circumstances where it is impossible to prepare the necessary specimens after exposure to high temperatures. Therefore, the propensity to estimate the destructive parameters of thermally heated rocks based on non-destructive factors is a helpful research field. Egyptian granodiorite samples were heated to temperatures of up to 800 °C before being treated to two different cooling methods: via the oven (slow-cooling) and using water (rapid cooling). The cooling condition, temperature, mass, porosity, absorption, dry density (D), and P-waves were used as input parameters in the predictive models for the UCS and E of thermally treated Egyptian granodiorite. Multi-linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to create predictive models. The performance of each prediction model was also evaluated using the (R2), (RMSE), (MAPE), and (VAF). The findings revealed that cooling methods and mass as input parameters to predict UCS and E have a minor impact on prediction models. In contrast, the other parameters had a good relationship with UCS and E. Due to severe damage to granodiorite samples, many input and output parameters were impossible to measure after 600 °C. The prediction models were thus developed up to this threshold temperature. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of predictive models demonstrated that the ANN pattern for predicting the UCS and E is the most accurate model, with R2 of 0.99, MAPE of 0.25%, VAF of 97.22%, and RMSE of 2.04.",2022,2022-11-30 00:00:00,8.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b64101d04b74363958324fadf2269d9e5dc91f5

Cloud computing provides different services over the internet, thus eliminating the need for personalized hardware and other resources. Cloud computing environments face some challenges in terms of resource utilization, energy efficiency, heterogeneous resources, etc. Tasks scheduling and virtual machines (VMs) are used as consolidation techniques in order to tackle these issues. Tasks scheduling has been extensively studied in the literature. The problem has been studied with different parameters and objectives. In this article, we address the problem of energy consumption and efficient resource utilization in virtualized cloud data centers. The proposed algorithm is based on task classification and thresholds for efficient scheduling and better resource utilization. In the first phase, workflow tasks are pre-processed to avoid bottlenecks by placing tasks with more dependencies and long execution times in separate queues. In the next step, tasks are classified based on the intensities of the required resources. Finally, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to select the best schedules. Experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Comparative results obtained on benchmark datasets are presented.

In the context of cloud auto-scaling, an important issue is the ability to define and use a resource reservation plan, which enables efficient resource scheduling. If necessary, the plan may allocate new resources upon reservation where a sufficient amount of resources is available. Our solution allows the updating of a reservation plan initially prepared by an administrator. It makes it possible to adapt reservation plans one or more weeks ahead. Hence, it allows time for the administrator to analyze the plan and discover potential problems with resource under-provisioning or over-provisioning, which may prevent server overload in the former case and unnecessary expenses in the latter. It also makes it possible to extract and analyze the knowledge learned, which may provide useful information about resource usage characteristics. The proposed solution is tested on OpenStack using real Wikipedia server traffic data.

10.3390/s17112556,Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Human Activity Recognition,"Adopting deep learning methods for human activity recognition has been effective in extracting discriminative features from raw input sequences acquired from body-worn sensors. Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time, typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However, the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result, typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity-recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper, we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional, bidirectional, and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on miscellaneous benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform methods employing conventional machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

10.3389/fpubh.2023.1024195,Toward explainable AI-empowered cognitive health assessment,"Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is of paramount importance to various domains, including healthcare, fitness, skill assessment, and personal assistants, to understand and explain the decision-making process of the artificial intelligence (AI) model. Smart homes embedded with smart devices and sensors enabled many context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. This study presents XAI-HAR, a novel XAI-empowered human activity recognition (HAR) approach based on key features identified from the data collected from sensors located at different places in a smart home. XAI-HAR identifies a set of new features (i.e., the total number of sensors used in a specific activity), as physical key features selection (PKFS) based on weighting criteria. Next, it presents statistical key features selection (SKFS) (i.e., mean, standard deviation) to handle the outliers and higher class variance. The proposed XAI-HAR is evaluated using machine learning models, namely, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and deep learning models such as deep neural network (DNN), convolution neural network (CNN), and CNN-based long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of XAI-HAR using RF classifier over all other machine learning and deep learning models. For explainability, XAI-HAR uses Local Interpretable Model Agnostic (LIME) with an RF classifier. XAI-HAR achieves 0.96% of F-score for health and dementia classification and 0.95 and 0.97% for activity recognition of dementia and healthy individuals, respectively.",2023,2023-03-09 00:00:00,15.0,72.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7d6bc4107361d00851fa71e954af0bee8e21515

10.3390/s22030706,Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using Fine-Tuned Convolutional Neural Network,"Hand gesture recognition is one of the most effective modes of interaction between humans and computers due to being highly flexible and user-friendly. A real-time hand gesture recognition system should aim to develop a user-independent interface with high recognition performance. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show high recognition rates in image classification problems. Due to the unavailability of large labeled image samples in static hand gesture images, it is a challenging task to train deep CNN networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet from scratch. Therefore, inspired by CNN performance, an end-to-end fine-tuning method of a pre-trained CNN model with score-level fusion technique is proposed here to recognize hand gestures in a dataset with a low number of gesture images. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOO CV) and regular CV tests on two benchmark datasets.

10.3389/fvets.2021.673407,"The Interplay Between Affect, Dog's Physical Activity and Dog–Owner Relationship","Leaving a dog home alone is part of everyday life for most dog owners. Previous research shows that dog–owner relationship has multifarious effects on dog behavior. However, little is known about the interplay between dog–owner relationship, physical activity of the dog, and affective experiences at the time of the owner leaving home and reunion when the owner comes home. In this paper, we explored how the general (daily, home alone, and over the 2-week study period) physical activity of the dog, and owner's perceptions of the dog's affective state were correlated at those particular moments. Nineteen volunteer dog owners had their dogs (N = 19) wear two activity trackers (ActiGraph wGT2X-GT and FitBark2) for 2 weeks 24 h/day. Prior to the 2-week continuous physical activity measurement period, the owners filled in questionnaires about the dog–owner relationship and the dog behavior. In daily questionnaires, owners described and assessed their own and their perception of the emotion-related experiences of their dog and behavior of the dog at the moment of separation and reunion. The results indicated that the dog–owner relationship has an interplay with the mean daily and weekly physical activity levels of the dog. An indication of strong emotional dog–owner relationship (especially related to the attentiveness of the dog, continuous companionship, and time spent together when relaxing) correlated positively with the mean daily activity levels of the dog during the first measurement week of the study. Results also suggest that the mean daily and over the 2-week measurement period physical activity of the dog correlated the affective experiences of the dog and owner as reported by the owner when the dog was left home alone. More research is needed to understand the interplay between affect, physical activity of the dog, dog–owner relationship, and the effects of these factors on, and their interplay with, the welfare of dogs.",2021,2021-12-09 00:00:00,7.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc76116bf0f83ecf8f3b6058311d2cec02d202e3

Sitting with computers for a long time may lead to unhealthy conditions like shoulder pain, numbness, headache, etc. To overcome this problem, human posture should be changed for particular intervals of time. This paper deals with using an inertial sensor built in the smartphone and can be used to overcome the unhealthy human sitting behaviors (HSBs) of the office worker. To monitor, six volunteers are considered within the age band of 26 ± 3 years, out of which four were male and two were female. Here, the inertial sensor is attached to the rear upper trunk of the body, and a dataset is generated for five different activities performed by the subjects while sitting in the chair in the office. Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) technique and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are jointly used to select feature vectors. The optimized features are fed to machine learning supervised classifiers such as naive Bayes, SVM, and KNN for recognition. Finally, the SVM classifier achieved 99.90% overall accuracy for different human sitting behaviors using an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors.",2021,2021-10-01 00:00:00,26.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/900288f65f9e0db46934ad31cde68b175433a28d

10.3390/ani11061549,Deep Learning Classification of Canine Behavior Using a Single Collar-Mounted Accelerometer: Real-World Validation,"Collar-mounted canine activity monitors can use accelerometer data to estimate dog activity levels, step counts, and distance traveled. With recent advances in machine learning and embedded computing, much more nuanced and accurate behavior classification has become possible, giving these affordable consumer devices the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pet healthcare. Here we describe a novel deep learning algorithm that classifies dog behavior at sub-second resolution using commercial pet activity monitors. We built machine learning training databases from over 5,000 videos of over 2,500 dogs and ran the algorithms in production on over 11 million days of device data. We then surveyed project participants representing 10,550 dogs, they provided us 163,110 event responses to validate real-world detection of eating and drinking behavior. The resultant algorithm displayed a sensitivity and specificity for detecting drinking behavior (0.949 and 0.999, respectively) and eating behavior (0.988, 0.983). We also demonstrated detection of licking, petting, rubbing, scratching, and sniffing. We show that the devices’ position on the collar has no measurable impact on performance. In production, users reported a true positive rate of 95.3% for eating (among 1,514 users), and of 94.9% (among 1,491 users) for drinking. The study demonstrates the accurate detection of important health-related canine behaviors using a collar-mounted accelerometer.

10.1057/s41599-020-00649-x,Human–dog relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic: booming dog adoption during social isolation,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic led to uncertainty and severe health and economic concerns. Previous studies indicated that owning a companion animal, such as a dog or a cat, has benefits for good mental health. Interactions with animals may help with depression and anxiety, particularly under stress-prone conditions. Human–animal interactions may even improve peer-to-peer social relationships, as well as enhance feelings of respect, trust, and empathy between people. Interestingly, it has also been shown that stress and poor well-being of dog owners negatively affect the well-being of their companion animals. However, a dramatic increase in dog abandonment could potentially occur due to COVID-19 related health, economic and social stresses, as well as due to the inconclusive reports of companion animals being potential COVID-19 carriers. Such a scenario may lead to high costs and considerable public health risks. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related social isolation, might lead to dramatic changes in human–dog bidirectional relationships. Using unique prospective and retrospective datasets, our objectives were to investigate how people perceived and acted during the COVID-19 pandemic social isolation, in regards to dog adoption and abandonment; and to examine the bidirectional relationship between the well-being of dog owners and that of their dogs. Overall, according to our analysis, as the social isolation became more stringent during the pandemic, the interest in dog adoption and the adoption rate increased significantly, while abandonment did not change. Moreover, there was a clear association between an individual’s impaired quality of life and their perceptions of a parallel deterioration in the quality of life of their dogs and reports of new behavioral problems. As humans and dogs are both social animals, these findings suggest potential benefits of the human–dog relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with the One Welfare approach that implies that there is a bidirectional connection between the welfare and health of humans and non-human animals. As our climate continues to change, more disasters including pandemics will likely occur, highlighting the importance of research into crisis-driven changes in human–animal relationships.",2020,2020-11-24 00:00:00,124.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eff25f3f9a79cc84c7d2660a76415f0e02c615d5
10.1038/s41928-021-00588-8,A printed millimetre-wave modulator and antenna array for backscatter communications at gigabit data rates,"Future devices for the Internet of Things will require communication systems that can deliver higher data rates at low power. Backscatter radio—in which wireless communication is achieved via reflection rather than radiation—is a low-complexity approach that requires a minimal number of active elements. However, it is typically limited to data rates of hundreds of megabits per second because of the low frequency bands used and the modulation techniques involved. Here we report a millimetre-wave modulator and antenna array for backscatter communications at gigabit data rates. This radiofrequency front-end consists of a microstrip patch antenna array and a single pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility transistor that supports a range of modulation formats including binary phase shift keying, quadrature phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation. The circuit is additively manufactured with inkjet printing using silver nanoparticle inks on a flexible liquid-crystal polymer substrate. A millimetre-wave transceiver is also designed to capture and downconvert the backscattered signals and route them for digital signal processing. With the system, we demonstrate a bit rate of two gigabits per second of backscatter transmission at millimetre-wave frequencies of 24–28 GHz, and with a front-end energy consumption of 0.17 pJ per bit. A microstrip patch antenna array and a single high-electron-mobility transistor, which are created with inkjet printing, can be used for backscatter communication at millimetre-wave frequencies, providing a bit rate of two gigabits per second and with a front-end energy consumption of only 0.17 pJ per bit.",2021,2021-06-01 00:00:00,62.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14d67aa4a3487bc2faabe66d9cb63aeb50d53d09
10.3390/jcm11040954,Estimation of Gross Motor Functions in Children with Cerebral Palsy Using Zebris FDM-T Treadmill,"A standardized observational instrument designed to measure change in gross motor function over time in children with cerebral palsy is the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). The process of evaluating a value for the GMFM index can be time consuming. It typically takes 45 to 60 min for the patient to complete all tasks, sometimes in two or more sessions. The diagnostic procedure requires trained and specialized therapists. The paper presents the estimation of the GMFM measure for patients with cerebral palsy based on the results of the Zebris FDM-T treadmill. For this purpose, the regression analysis was used. Estimations based on the Generalized Linear Regression were assessed using different error metrics. The results obtained showed that the GMFM score can be estimated with acceptable accuracy. Because the Zebris FDM-T is a widely used device in gait rehabilitation, our method has the potential to be widely adopted for objective diagnostics of children with cerebral palsy.",2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,5.0,71.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ee0bdbb1395ac1ba4e428b0fa00365776790c2a

10.36227/techrxiv.16718788,A-GAS: A Probabilistic Approach for Generating Automated Gait Assessment Score for Cerebral Palsy Children,"Gait disorders in children with cerebral palsy (CP) affect their mental, physical, economic, and social lives. Gait assessment is one of the essential steps of gait management. It has been widely used for clinical decision making and evaluation of different treatment outcomes. However, most of the present methods of gait assessment are subjective, less sensitive to small pathological changes, time-taking and need a great effort of an expert. This work proposes an automated, comprehensive gait assessment score (A-GAS) for gait disorders in CP. Kinematic data of 356 CP and 41 typically developing subjects is used to validate the performance of A-GAS. For the computation of A-GAS, instance abnormality index (AII) and abnormality index (AI) are calculated. AII quantifies gait abnormality of a gait cycle instance, while AI quantifies gait abnormality of a joint angle profile during walking. AII is calculated for all gait cycle instances by performing probabilistic and statistical analyses. Abnormality index (AI) is a weighted sum of AII, computed for each joint angle profile. A-GAS is a weighted sum of AI, calculated for a lower limb. Moreover, a graphical representation of the gait assessment report, including AII, AI, and A-GAS is generated for providing a better depiction of the assessment score. Furthermore, the work compares A-GAS with a present rating-based gait assessment scores to understand fundamental differences. Finally, A-GAS’s performance is verified for a high-cost multi-camera set-up using nine joint angle profiles and a low-cost single camera set-up using three joint angle profiles. Results show no significant differences in performance of A-GAS for both the set-ups. Therefore, A-GAS for both the set-ups can be used interchangeably.",2021,2021-10-05 00:00:00,9.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dac867f746dc5420a41f4b88cfe8fe4df083f5b2

A large number of them are installed using trenchless Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) technology. The aim of this work was to develop and compare new machine learning models dedicated for risk assessment in HDD projects. The data from 133 HDD projects from eight countries of the world were gathered, profiled, and preprocessed. Three machine learning models, logistic regression, random forests, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were developed to predict the overall HDD project outcome (failure free installation or installation likely to fail), and the occurrence of identified unwanted events. The best performance in terms of recall and accuracy was achieved for the developed ANN model, which proved to be efficient, fast and robust in predicting risks in HDD projects. Machine learning applications in the proposed models enabled eliminating the involvement of a group of experts in the risk assessment process and therefore significantly lower the costs associated with the risk assessment process. Future research may be oriented towards developing a comprehensive risk management system, which will enable dynamic risk assessment taking into account various combinations of risk mitigation actions.",2021,2021-01-07 00:00:00,13.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4232ee48e7c2408f8c6dddca3d4fca3cee4a7cd8

10.3390/children7100149,The Utility of Gait Deviation Index (GDI) and Gait Variability Index (GVI) in Detecting Gait Changes in Spastic Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy Children Using Ankle–Foot Orthoses (AFO),"Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) children present complex and heterogeneous motor disorders that cause gait deviations. Clinical gait analysis (CGA) is used to identify, understand and support the management of gait deviations in CP. Children with CP often use ankle–foot orthosis (AFO) to facilitate and optimize their walking ability. The aim of this study was to assess whether the gait deviation index (GDI) and the gait variability index (GVI) results can reflect the changes of spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters in spastic hemiplegic CP children wearing AFO. Method: The study group consisted of 37 CP children with hemiparesis. All had undergone a comprehensive, instrumented gait analysis while walking, both barefoot and with their AFO, during the same CGA session. Kinematic and spatio-temporal data were collected and GVI and GDI gait indexes were calculated. Results: Significant differences were found between the barefoot condition and the AFO conditions for selected spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters. Changes in GVI and GDI were also statistically significant. Conclusions: The use of AFO in hemiplegic CP children caused a statistically significant improvement in spatio-temporal and kinematic gait parameters. It was found that these changes were also reflected by GVI and GDI. These findings might suggest that gait indices, such as GDI and GVI, as clinical outcome measures, may reflect the effects of specific therapeutic interventions in CP children.",2020,2020-09-25 00:00:00,8.0,27.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a221d095c04ab0dcf238693d51c766f8bb91ef8b

However, if these deficits are associated with axial rigidity, the functional mobility or health related quality of life (HRQoL), remains unknown. The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between axial ROM and axial rigidity, the functional mobility and HRQoL in patients with mild to moderate PD. Methods: An exploratory study was conducted. Non-probabilistic sampling of consecutive cases was used. Active trunk ROM was assessed by a universal goniometer. A Biodex System isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure the rigidity of the trunk. Functional mobility was determined by the Get Up and Go (GUG) test, and HRQoL was assessed with the PDQ-39 and EuroQol-5D questionnaires. Results: Thirty-six mild to moderate patients with PD were evaluated. Significant correlations were observed between trunk extensors rigidity and trunk flexion and extension ROM. Significant correlations were observed between trunk flexion, extension and rotation ROM and GUG. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between trunk ROM for flexion, extension and rotations (both sides) and PDQ-39 total score. However, these correlations were considered poor. Conclusions: Trunk ROM for flexion and extension movements, measured by a universal goniometer, were correlated with axial extensors rigidity, evaluated by a technological device at 30°/s and 45°/s, and functional mobility. Moreover, trunk ROM for trunk flexion, extension and rotations were correlated with HRQoL in patients with mild to moderate PD.",2020,2020-04-27 00:00:00,25.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30c30578e82a506a4de05d5c8cf06d4587088429

Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixty-eight individuals (mean age 13.3 ± 5.7 years; 35% female, 92% Caucasian) were randomized to HCLC followed by SAP therapy (intensive group; N = 48) or to the usual-care group treated with multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy (N = 20). Primary outcome was C-peptide concentrations during mixed-meal tolerance tests at 12 months. RESULTS Intensive-group participants initiated HCLC a median of 6 days after diagnosis for a median duration of 71.3 h, during which median participant mean glucose concentration was 140 mg/dL (interquartile range 134–153 mg/dL). During outpatient SAP, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use decreased over time, and at 12 months, only 33% of intensive participants averaged sensor use ≥6 days/week. In the usual-care group, insulin pump and CGM use were initiated prior to 12 months by 15 and 5 participants, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were similar in both groups throughout the study. At 12 months, the geometric mean (95% CI) of C-peptide area under the curve was 0.43 (0.34–0.52) pmol/mL in the intensive group and 0.52 (0.32–0.75) pmol/mL in the usual-care group (P = 0.49). Thirty-seven (79%) intensive and 16 (80%) usual-care participants had a peak C-peptide concentration ≥0.2 pmol/mL (P = 0.30).

10.1371/journal.pone.0046935,"Non-Gaussian Distributions Affect Identification of Expression Patterns, Functional Annotation, and Prospective Classification in Human Cancer Genomes","Introduction Gene expression data is often assumed to be normally-distributed, but this assumption has not been tested rigorously. We investigate the distribution of expression data in human cancer genomes and study the implications of deviations from the normal distribution for translational molecular oncology research. Methods We conducted a central moments analysis of five cancer genomes and performed empiric distribution fitting to examine the true distribution of expression data both on the complete-experiment and on the individual-gene levels. We used a variety of parametric and nonparametric methods to test the effects of deviations from normality on gene calling, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification using a sixth cancer genome. Results Central moments analyses reveal statistically-significant deviations from normality in all of the analyzed cancer genomes. We observe as much as 37% variability in gene calling, 39% variability in functional annotation, and 30% variability in prospective, molecular tumor subclassification associated with this effect. Conclusions Cancer gene expression profiles are not normally-distributed, either on the complete-experiment or on the individual-gene level. Instead, they exhibit complex, heavy-tailed distributions characterized by statistically-significant skewness and kurtosis. The non-Gaussian distribution of this data affects identification of differentially-expressed genes, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification. These effects may be reduced in some circumstances, although not completely eliminated, by using nonparametric analytics. This analysis highlights two unreliable assumptions of translational cancer gene expression analysis: that “small” departures from normality in the expression data distributions are analytically-insignificant and that “robust” gene-calling algorithms can fully compensate for these effects.",2012,2012-10-31 00:00:00,31.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/687186174d2fb660e182edd489be50cbf649a4b3

10.3390/bioengineering10121421,A Critical Assessment of Generative Models for Synthetic Data Augmentation on Limited Pneumonia X-ray Data,"In medical imaging, deep learning models serve as invaluable tools for expediting diagnoses and aiding specialized medical professionals in making clinical decisions. However, effectively training deep learning models typically necessitates substantial quantities of high-quality data, a resource often lacking in numerous medical imaging scenarios. One way to overcome this deficiency is to artificially generate such images. Therefore, in this comparative study we train five generative models to artificially increase the amount of available data in such a scenario. This synthetic data approach is evaluated on a a downstream classification task, predicting four causes for pneumonia as well as healthy cases on 1082 chest X-ray images. Quantitative and medical assessments show that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach significantly outperforms more recent diffusion-based approaches on this limited dataset with better image quality and pathological plausibility. We show that better image quality surprisingly does not translate to improved classification performance by evaluating five different classification models and varying the amount of additional training data. Class-specific metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score show a substantial improvement by using synthetic images, emphasizing the data rebalancing effect of less frequent classes. However, overall performance does not improve for most models and configurations, except for a DreamBooth approach which shows a +0.52 improvement in overall accuracy. The large variance of performance impact in this study suggests a careful consideration of utilizing generative models for limited data scenarios, especially with an unexpected negative correlation between image quality and downstream classification improvement.",2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,4.0,68.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db5ccb1d7e75c23995a42806e8ea2e03b074269d

10.1007/s10278-023-00880-3,Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Automatic Detection of Peri-implant Marginal Bone Remodeling in Intraoral Radiographs,"Peri-implantitis can cause marginal bone remodeling around implants. The aim is to develop an automatic image processing approach based on two artificial intelligence ( AI ) techniques in intraoral (periapical and bitewing) radiographs to assist dentists in determining bone loss. The first is a deep learning ( DL ) object-detector (YOLOv3) to roughly identify (no exact localization is required) two objects: prosthesis (crown) and implant (screw). The second is an image understanding-based ( IU ) process to fine-tune lines on screw edges and to identify significant points (intensity bone changes, intersections between screw and crown). Distances between these points are used to compute bone loss. A total of 2920 radiographs were used for training (50%) and testing (50%) the DL process. The mAP@0.5 metric is used for performance evaluation of DL considering periapical/bitewing and screws/crowns in upper and lower jaws, with scores ranging from 0.537 to 0.898 (sufficient because DL only needs an approximation). The IU performance is assessed with 50% of the testing radiographs through the t test statistical method, obtaining p values of 0.0106 (line fitting) and 0.0213 (significant point detection). The IU performance is satisfactory, as these values are in accordance with the statistical average/standard deviation in pixels for line fitting (2.75/1.01) and for significant point detection (2.63/1.28) according to the expert criteria of dentists, who establish the ground-truth lines and significant points.

10.2478/popets-2021-0071,Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption from Ring-Learning-with-Errors,"Abstract We propose and evaluate a secure-multiparty-computation (MPC) solution in the semi-honest model with dishonest majority that is based on multiparty homomorphic encryption (MHE). To support our solution, we introduce a multiparty version of the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic cryptosystem and implement it in an open-source library. MHE-based MPC solutions have several advantages: Their transcript is public, their o~ine phase is compact, and their circuit-evaluation procedure is noninteractive. By exploiting these properties, the communication complexity of MPC tasks is reduced from quadratic to linear in the number of parties, thus enabling secure computation among potentially thousands of parties and in a broad variety of computing paradigms, from the traditional peer-to-peer setting to cloud-outsourcing and smart-contract technologies. MHE-based approaches can also outperform the state-of-the-art solutions, even for a small number of parties. We demonstrate this for three circuits: private input selection with application to private-information retrieval, component-wise vector multiplication with application to private-set intersection, and Beaver multiplication triples generation. For the first circuit, privately selecting one input among eight thousand parties’ (of 32 KB each) requires only 1.31 MB of communication per party and completes in 61.7 seconds. For the second circuit with eight parties, our approach is 8.6 times faster and requires 39.3 times less communication than the current methods. For the third circuit and ten parties, our approach generates 20 times more triples per second while requiring 136 times less communication per-triple than an approach based on oblivious transfer.

10.1561/3300000019,A Pragmatic Introduction to Secure Multi-Party Computation,"Since its introduction by Andrew Yao in the 1980s, multi-party computation has developed from a theoretical curiosity to an important tool for building large-scale privacy-preserving applications. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables a group to jointly perform a computation without disclosing any participant’s private inputs. The participants agree on a function to compute, and then can use an MPC protocol to jointly compute the output of that function on their secret inputs without revealing them. This monograph provides an introduction to multi-party computation for practitioners interested in building privacy-preserving applications and researchers who want to work in the area. The authors introduce the foundations of MPC and describe the current state of the art. The goal is to enable readers to understand what is possible today, and what may be possible in the future. It provides a starting point for building applications using MPC and for developing MPC protocols, implementations, tools, and applications.

10.1186/s13148-019-0772-4,Machine-learned analysis of global and glial/opioid intersection–related DNA methylation in patients with persistent pain after breast cancer surgery,"Glial cells in the central nervous system play a key role in neuroinflammation and subsequent central sensitization to pain. They are therefore involved in the development of persistent pain. One of the main sites of interaction of the immune system with persistent pain has been identified as neuro-immune crosstalk at the glial-opioid interface. The present study examined a potential association between the DNA methylation of two key players of glial/opioid intersection and persistent postoperative pain. In a cohort of 140 women who had undergone breast cancer surgery, and were assigned based on a 3-year follow-up to either a persistent or non-persistent pain phenotype, the role of epigenetic regulation of key players in the glial-opioid interface was assessed. The methylation of genes coding for the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a major mediator of glial contributions to persistent pain or for the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) was analyzed and its association with the pain phenotype was compared with that conferred by global genome-wide DNA methylation assessed via quantification of the methylation in the retrotransposon LINE1. Training of machine learning algorithms indicated that the global DNA methylation provided a similar diagnostic accuracy for persistent pain as previously established non-genetic predictors. However, the diagnosis can be based on a single DNA based marker. By contrast, the methylation of TLR4 or OPRM1 genes could not contribute further to the allocation of the patients to the pain-related phenotype groups.

However, there has been disagreement regarding the factor structure of the GAD-7, and there is a need for larger studies investigating the psychometric properties of the measure. Patients undergoing treatment (N = 1201), both inpatient and outpatient patients, completed the GAD-7 at pre- and post-treatment. Measures of depression, well-being, and other anxiety measures were also completed, making it possible to investigate convergent and divergent validity. Internal consistency and convergent validity were excellent for the total sample, and there was acceptable variation related to treatment groups. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a random sample (50%) of the patients at intake and then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the factor structure in the other part of the sample at intake. The EFA indicated a clear one-factor solution, but the one-factor solution with CFA provided a poor fit to the data. Correlating the residuals among items assessing somatic symptoms led to a good fit in a respecified CFA solution.

10.1371/journal.pone.0252069,A machine learning prediction model for waiting time to kidney transplant,"Background Predicting waiting time for a deceased donor kidney transplant can help patients and clinicians to discuss management and contribute to a more efficient use of resources. This study aimed at developing a predictor model to estimate time on a kidney transplant waiting list using a machine learning approach. Methods A retrospective cohort study including data of patients registered, between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, in the waiting list of São Paulo State Organ Allocation System (SP-OAS) /Brazil. Data were randomly divided into two groups: 75% for training and 25% for testing. A Cox regression model was fitted with deceased donor transplant as the outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different Cox models. Cox hazard ratios were used to develop the risk-prediction equations. Results Of 54,055 records retrieved, 48,153 registries were included in the final analysis. During the study period, approximately 1/3 of the patients were transplanted with a deceased donor. The major characteristics associated with changes in the likelihood of transplantation were age, subregion, cPRA, and frequency of HLA-DR, -B and -A. The model developed was able to predict waiting time with good agreement in internal validation (c-index = 0.70). Conclusion The kidney transplant waiting time calculator developed shows good predictive performance and provides information that may be valuable in assisting candidates and their providers. Moreover, it can significantly improve the use of economic resources and the management of patient care before transplant.",2021,2021-05-20 00:00:00,11.0,28.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50cde98473dd626a0afb969c7a4945cc917689c3

We retrospectively evaluated the data of kidney transplant procedures until hospital discharge, according to kidney function recovery after the procedure. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the non-sensitized, 1st KTx from deceased donors performed between Jan/2010 to Dec/2017. Results: Out of the 1300 KTx from deceased donors performed in this period, 730 patients were studied and divided into 3 groups: Immediate Renal Function (IRF) - decrease in serum creatinine ≥ 10% on two consecutive days; Delayed Graft Function (DGF) - decrease in serum creatinine <10% on two consecutive days, without the need for dialysis, and Dialysis (D) - need for dialysis during the first week. Patients in group D stayed longer in the hospital compared to DGF and IRF (21, 11 and 8 days respectively, p < 0.001). More D patients (21%) were admitted to the ICU and performed a greater number of laboratory tests (p < 0.001) and renal biopsies (p < 0.001), in addition to receiving a higher amount of immunosuppressants. Total hospital costs were higher in group D and DGF compared to IRF (U$ 7.021,48; U$ 3.603,42 and U$ 2.642,37 respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The costs of the transplant procedure is impacted by the recovery of kidney function after the transplant. The reimbursement for each of these different kidney function outcomes should be individualized in order to cover their real costs.",2021,2021-04-23 00:00:00,3.0,20.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf824694bfab6c70c0091ec4ee61cb503055a80c

Despite this success, the high risk of premature death and frequent occurrence of graft failure remain important clinical and research challenges. The current burst of studies and other innovative initiatives using artificial intelligence (AI) for a wide range of analytical and practical applications in biomedical areas seems to correlate with the same trend observed in publications in the kidney transplantation field, and points toward the potential of such novel approaches to address the aforementioned aim of improving long-term outcomes of kidney transplant recipients (KTR). However, at the same time, this trend underscores now more than ever the old methodological challenges and potential threats that the research and clinical community needs to be aware of and actively look after with regard to AI-driven evidence. The purpose of this narrative mini-review is to explore challenges for obtaining applicable and adequate kidney transplant data for analyses using AI techniques to develop prediction models, and to propose next steps in the field. We make a call to act toward establishing the strong collaborations needed to bring innovative synergies further augmented by AI, which have the potential to impact the long-term care of KTR.

In organ transplantation, delayed graft function (DGF) remains a major concern in deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT). To this end, we harnessed ML to build personalized prognostic models to predict DGF. Registry data were obtained on adult DDKT recipients for model development (n = 55,044) and validation (n = 6176). Incidence rates of DGF were 25.1% and 26.3% for the development and validation sets, respectively. Twenty-six predictors were identified via recursive feature elimination with random forest. Five widely-used ML algorithms—logistic regression (LR), elastic net, random forest, artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were trained and compared with a baseline LR model fitted with previously identified risk factors. The new ML models, particularly ANN with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.732 and XGB with ROC-AUC of 0.735, exhibited superior performance to the baseline model (ROC-AUC = 0.705). This study demonstrates the use of ML as a viable strategy to enable personalized risk quantification for medical applications.

Early prediction of subclinical mastitis can enable dairy farmers to perform interventions to mitigate its effect. The present study investigated how well predictive models built using machine learning techniques can detect subclinical mastitis up to 7 d before its occurrence. The data set used consisted of 1,346,207 milk-day (i.e., a day when milk was collected on both morning and evening) records spanning 9 yr from 2,389 cows producing on 7 Irish research farms. Individual cow composite milk yield and maximum milk flow were available twice daily, whereas milk composition (i.e., fat, lactose, protein) and somatic cell count (SCC) were collected once per week. Other features describing parity, calving dates, predicted transmitting ability for SCC, body weight, and history of subclinical mastitis were also available. The results of the study showed that a gradient boosting machine model trained to predict the onset of subclinical mastitis 7 d before a subclinical case occurs achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 69.45 and 95.64%, respectively. Reduced data collection frequency, where milk composition and SCC were recorded only every 15, 30, 45, and 60 d was simulated by masking data, to reflect the frequency of recording of this data on commercial dairy farms in Ireland. The sensitivity and specificity scores reduced as recording frequency reduced with respective scores of 66.93 and 80.43% when milk composition and SCC were recorded just every 60 d. Results demonstrate that models built on data that could be recorded routinely available on commercial dairy farms, can achieve useful predictive ability of subclinical mastitis even with reduced frequency of milk composition and SCC recording.",2023,2023-05-31 00:00:00,11.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49ba8208c07bfc0ca202ffdaecc406e0a4b504be

We studied the effect of mastitis on cow milk yield, the effect of mastitis on udder surface skin temperature, and the dependence between severity of mastitis and udder temperature. We determined the presence of a significant relationship between the udder surface skin temperature and the milk yield of mastitis cows (Coefficient of determination = 0.886, linear Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.96), as well as the absence of a significant relationship between the udder surface skin temperature and the milk yield of healthy cows (Coefficient of determination = 0.029, linear Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.16). We substantiated the temperature ranges of the udder surface of healthy cows [32–35.9 °C] and mastitis [36.1–39 °C]. The obtained data made it possible to form an algorithm that allows a quick assessment of the herd for the presence of udder disease, using infrared images of the udder surface skin temperature.",2022,2022-06-30 00:00:00,11.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc51d5c2a09651d13e1f7e12814b724b484d0d82
10.3390/ani12101251,The Early Prediction of Common Disorders in Dairy Cows Monitored by Automatic Systems with Machine Learning Algorithms,"Simple Summary Identifying cows with a higher risk of health disorders such as clinical mastitis, subclinical ketosis, lameness, and metritis could be advantageous for farms to prevent and ameliorate the negative effects of these disorders in a timely manner. In this study, we adopt eight machine learning algorithms using an R software for analyzing a dataset of 14-dimensions of dairy cows with health disorders across the whole lactation period in intensive Chinese dairy farms, applying automatic monitoring systems and milking systems. The variables analyzed by the machine learning algorithms include milk yield, physical activity, changes in rumination time, and the electrical conductivity of milk. Six parameters were presented to evaluate the performance metrics of the models, with the Rpart algorithm outperforming others and indicating a strong generalization ability of this algorithm. A total of 10 variables of greater importance in three models of Rpart, eXtreme Gradient, and Adaboost demonstrated the consistency of those variables as predictors for disorders of dairy cows monitored by automatic systems. The results obtained in this study highlighted the importance of using big data on the farm to develop predictive and prescriptive decision support tools to boost the development of precision livestock farming. Abstract We use multidimensional data from automated monitoring systems and milking systems to predict disorders of dairy cows by employing eight machine learning algorithms. The data included the season, days in milking, parity, age at the time of disorders, milk yield (kg/day), activity (unitless), six variables related to rumination time, and two variables related to the electrical conductivity of milk. We analyze 131 sick cows and 149 healthy cows with identical lactation days and parity; all data are collected on the same day, which corresponds to the diagnosis day for disordered cows. For disordered cows, each variable, except the ratio of rumination time from daytime to nighttime, displays a decreasing/increasing trend from d-7 or d-3 to d0 and/or d-1, with the d0, d-1, or d-2 values reaching the minimum or maximum. The test data sensitivity for three algorithms exceeded 80%, and the accuracies of the eight algorithms ranged from 65.08% to 84.21%. The area under the curve (AUC) of the three algorithms was >80%. Overall, Rpart best predicts the disorders with an accuracy, precision, and AUC of 81.58%, 92.86%, and 0.908, respectively. The machine learning algorithms may be an appropriate and powerful decision support and monitoring tool to detect herds with common health disorders.",2022,2022-05-01 00:00:00,29.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f1cd241a20b3cd0445a4b8892208baca8df5cfe

The increasing performance of thermal cameras over time and their usability in different areas increase their use in livestocks. Infrared thermography (IRT) technology is a noninvasive method that can estimate the surface temperature of objects. The objective of this study was to evaluate early detection of mastitis in Holstein-Friesian dairy cattle by using both udder surface temperatures (Tmax) from images obtained with the help of a FLIR One Pro thermal camera and some parameters such as Lab (CIE L*, a*, b*), HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness), RGB (Red, Green, Blue) by processing thermal images with the help of ImageJ program via classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. According to CMT by using CART analysis in this study, 64.9% of cows with udder surface temperature lower than 38.85 were healthy, and 73.3% of cows higher than 38.85 were determined as unhealthy. As for SCC, 77.6% of cows with udder surface temperature lower than 38.65 were healthy and 58.6% of cows with higher than 38.65 were determined as unhealthy. The areas under ROC (AUC) were found to be statistically significant in the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis. (P 0.05).

Data collection during routine recording procedures and access to large datasets have shed the light on the possibility to use trained machine learning algorithms to predict the udder health status of cows. In this study, we compared eight different machine learning methods (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Generalized Linear Model with logit link function, Naïve Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Neural Network) to predict udder health status of cows based on somatic cell counts. Prediction accuracies of all methods were above 75%. According to different metrics, Neural Network, Random Forest and linear methods had the best performance in predicting udder health classes at a given test-day (healthy or mastitic according to somatic cell count below or above a predefined threshold of 200,000 cells/mL) based on the cow’s milk traits recorded at previous test-day. Our findings suggest machine learning algorithms as a promising tool to improve decision making for farmers.

10.3168/jds.2020-19894,Application of udder surface temperature by infrared thermography for diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in Holstein cows located in tropical highlands.,"Several reports have indicated that udder surface temperature (UST) can be a useful indicator of subclinical mastitis (SCM). The objective was to evaluate UST by infrared thermography (IRT) as a diagnostic tool for SCM and intramammary infection (IMI), and to assess the influence of environmental conditions in the potential diagnosis of this disease in dairy cows located at high-altitude tropical regions. A total of 105 cows (397 quarters) from 3 dairy farms with mechanical and manual milking methods were enrolled in the study. Subclinical mastitis was diagnosed when quarter samples had a somatic cell count (SCC) ≥200 × 103 cells/mL, microbial growth (MG) was defined when a major pathogen (≥1 cfu/plate) or Corynebacterium spp. (≥10 cfu/plate) was isolated, and IMI was defined as the presence of MG and SCC ≥100 × 103 cells/mL. Infrared images were taken with a thermal camera placed 1 m away from the udder, and shots of the rear and left and right lateral view were made during the morning milking, before any manipulation of the udder and employing dark cardboard on the contralateral side to avoid artifacts in the background. A multilevel mixed effects linear regression model clustered within cows and herd was performed to evaluate the associations with UST. Clinical performance was evaluated using the Youden index to establish the optimum UST thresholds, which were set at 32.6°C for any case definition when milking was by hand, at 33.7°C for MG, and at 34°C for SCM and IMI in machine-milked quarters. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), area under curve (AUC), and positive likelihood ratio (+LR) were also assessed. Test agreement was assessed by kappa coefficient (κ). The UST of healthy quarters ranged between (95% CI) 32.4 and 32.6°C, lower than SCM quarters (n = 88) at 32.9°C (95% CI: 32.7-33.1 °C), MG quarters (n = 56) at 33.5°C (95% CI: 33.3-33.7°C), and IMI quarters (n = 50) at 33.5°C (95% CI: 33.2-33.7 °C). The UST was also related to the milking method: higher temperatures were observed for hand milking (n = 90) compared with machine milking (n = 185). No relation between environmental conditions such as wind speed, atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, and temperature-humidity index and UST were observed during this study. For hand milking, the optimal UST threshold was 32.6°C; for SCM, Se = 0.53, Sp = 0.89, AUC = 0.71, κ = 0.4; for MG, Se = 0.83, Sp = 0.93, AUC = 0.88, κ = 0.77; and for IMI, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.92, AUC = 0.87, κ = 0.74.

10.3847/1538-4357/aa9f1e,Compositional Imprints in Density–Distance–Time: A Rocky Composition for Close-in Low-mass Exoplanets from the Location of the Valley of Evaporation,"We use an end-to-end model of planet formation, thermodynamic evolution, and atmospheric escape to investigate how the statistical imprints of evaporation depend on the bulk composition of planetary cores (rocky versus icy). We find that the population-wide imprints like the location of the “evaporation valley” in the distance–radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution clearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with the observed position of the valley suggests that close-in low-mass Kepler planets have a predominantly Earth-like rocky composition. Combined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that low-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline but were still undergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets losing all primordial H/He. For planets in this “triangle of evaporation” in the distance–radius plane, the degeneracy in composition is reduced. In the observed planetary mass–mean density diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with an increasing radius (R/R⊕ ≲ 1.6 rocky; 1.6–3.0 ices, and/or H/He; ≳3: H/He). The mass–density diagram contains important information about formation and evolution. Its characteristic broken V-shape reveals the transitions from solid planets to low-mass core-dominated planets with H/He and finally to gas-dominated giants. Evaporation causes the density and orbital distance to be anticorrelated for low-mass planets in contrast to giants, where closer-in planets are less dense, likely due to inflation. The temporal evolution of the statistical properties reported here will be of interest for the PLATO 2.0 mission, which will observe the temporal dimension.",2017,2017-06-01 00:00:00,176.0,125.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac12486f3c9a2c90db57b5e0bb82a3aab24f33c1

10.7759/cureus.40767,Ninjin’yoeito Improves Genitourinary Symptoms in Patients With Frailty,"Introduction In geriatric medicine, there is currently significant attention on frailty, a condition commonly associated with aging and characterized by muscle weakness and other age-related changes. Within the fields of urology and gynecology, conditions such as overactive bladder (OAB) and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) have been identified as crucial concerns due to their negative impact on the quality of life of elderly individuals. In this study, we investigated the potential of Ninjin'yoeito (NYT), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, as a viable treatment option for frailty. Additionally, we hypothesized that NYT may also contribute to the improvement of symptoms associated with OAB and GSM, and potentially help in reducing the dosage of OAB medications. Methods In this retrospective cohort study conducted from November 2016 to November 2022, we created a website describing the relationship between frailty and genitourinary symptoms in frail patients aged ≥ 65 years with GSM who underwent pelvic floor muscle training. The patients were divided into two propensity score-matched groups: NYT group (received NYT for one year) and no-NYT group (did not receive NYT), based on their wishes. The fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight (FRAIL) scale was used to assess frailty status. Urinary symptoms were evaluated using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). Genital symptoms were investigated using the vaginal health index score and vulvodynia swab test. The value of each score was obtained before (T0) and 12 months after (T12) treatment, and the difference (ΔT0/T12) was calculated. Results During the study period, 985 outpatients visited our clinic, of whom 725 were considered frail/pre-frail; 402 women with frailty/pre-frailty (mean age 77.5 ± 6.49 years) were included, with a median follow-up of 14.5 months. The NYT and no-NYT groups had 220 and 182 patients, respectively. After propensity score matching, each group had 159 patients. ΔT0/T12FRAIL scale score was significantly higher in the NYT group (0.13 ± 0.37) than in the no-NYT (0.01 ± 0.10) group (p=0.001.) However, urinary symptoms improved in the NYT group more than in the no-NYT in terms of the following parameters: ΔT0/T12OABSS (NYT: 0.89 ± 1.65; no-NYTl: 0.36 ± 1.14, p=0.001) and ΔT0/T12ICIQ-SF score (NYT: 1.51 ± 1.75; no-NYT: 0.42 ± 1.18, p<0.001). Genital symptoms were better in the NYT group in terms of ΔT0/T12VHIS (NYT: 0.58 ±1.08; no-NYT: 0.21 ±0.65, p<0.001). The vulvodynia swab test showed improvements in left para-hymen evoked pain in both groups. In the NYT group, 5% of the patients underwent antimuscarinic drug dose reduction for overactive bladder treatment. NYT use was not associated with significant side effects, and only 0.6% of patients reported drug allergies. Conclusion NYT improved activity levels in frail/pre-frail patients. Moreover, NYT use improved various genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with frailty/pre-frailty. Treatment with NYT may reduce the dose of overactive bladder medications. The anticholinergic load-reducing effect of NYT may help solve the problem of polypharmacy.",2023,2023-06-01 00:00:00,7.0,30.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/942eef8c9af358a582335a2ebc78fe513a726913

However, its therapeutic efficacy and safety have not been thoroughly reviewed in elderly patients. This study aims to provide treatment outcomes for patients aged ≥75 years, and to identify factors associated with unfavorable outcomes. Patients receiving intradetrusor injections of 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA for refractory OAB between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Urodynamic parameters, underlying comorbidities, subjective success, and unfavorable outcomes were assessed. A total of 192 patients were included, and 65 of them were classified into the elderly group. For the elderly group, 60.0% experienced subjective dryness, and 84.6% remained subjective success at 6 months after the injections. The prevalence rates of common unfavorable outcomes, including urinary tract infections, large post-void residual urine volume, and urinary retention, were 9.2%, 27.7%, and 12.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that female, baseline urodynamic parameters, and diabetes mellitus were associated with unfavorable outcomes in the elderly group.

10.3389/fcimb.2022.1030315,Unraveling the impact of Lactobacillus spp. and other urinary microorganisms on the efficacy of mirabegron in female patients with overactive bladder,"Objective Overactive bladder (OAB) is a disease that seriously affects patients’ quality of life and mental health. To address this issue, more and more researchers are examining the relationship between OAB treatment and urinary microecology. In this study, we sought to determine whether differences in treatment efficacy were related to microbiome diversity and composition as well as the abundance of specific genera. Machine learning algorithms were used to construct predictive models for urine microbiota-based treatment of OAB. Methods Urine samples were obtained from 64 adult female OAB patients for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients’ overactive bladder symptom scores (OABSS) were collected before and after mirabegron treatment and patients were divided into effective and ineffective groups. The relationship between the relative abundance of certain genera and OABSS were analyzed. Three machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), supporting vector machine (SVM) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were utilized to predict the therapeutic effect of mirabegron based on the relative abundance of certain genera in OAB patients’ urine microbiome. Results The species composition of the two groups differed. For one, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly higher in the effective group than in the ineffective group. In addition, the relative abundance of Gardnerella and Prevotella in the effective group was significantly lower than in the ineffective group. Alpha-diversity and beta-diversity differed significantly between the two groups. LEfSe analysis revealed that Lactobacillus abundance increased while Prevotella and Gardnerella abundance decreased in the effective group. The Lactobacillus abundance ROC curve had high predictive accuracy. The OABSS after treatment was negatively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus, whereas the relationship between OABSS and Prevotella and Gardnerella showed the opposite trend. In addition, RF, SVM and XGBoost models demonstrated high predictive ability to assess the effect of mirabegron in OAB patients in the test cohort. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that urinary microbiota might influence the efficacy of mirabegron, and that Lactobacillus might be a potential marker for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of mirabegron in OAB patients.",2022,2022-11-14 00:00:00,7.0,33.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f556c0f2e508e3f1bff1a5d0e0fe50247223108

Given the rapidly increasing proportion of older adults in Japan, a better understanding of the relationship between frailty and OAB is needed to inform future healthcare planning. This study assessed the association between frailty and OAB in older adults in Japan and evaluated the impact on their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods This was a cross-sectional re-contact study of respondents who previously completed the National Health and Wellness Survey 2018 in Japan. Participants were aged ≥65 years and Japanese speakers and readers. As part of a customized online survey, participants were screened for frailty using the Kihon Checklist (frail = scores ≥8 points) and OAB using the overactive bladder symptom score (OAB = total score ≥ 3 points and ≥ 2 points on question 3). The primary endpoint was the odds ratio of frailty in older adults with and without OAB assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model. Secondary endpoints were the prevalence rates of OAB and frailty. Exploratory endpoints assessed HRQoL using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Survey Instrument version 2 (SF-12v2). Results Overall, 2953 participants were included: 150 (5.1%) were frail OAB, 416 (14.1%) non-frail OAB, 287 (9.7%) frail non-OAB, and 2100 (71.1%) non-frail non-OAB. There was a statistically significant correlation between frailty and OAB demonstrated by an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.78 (2.18–3.54; p  <  0.001). The prevalence (95% CI) of OAB was 34.3% (29.9–38.8) in frail and 16.5% (15.1–18.0) in non-frail older adults; the prevalence of frailty was 26.5% (22.9–30.1) and 12.0% (10.7–13.3) in older adults with and without OAB. HRQoL was assessed in 150 participants per group. The adjusted HRQoL analyses showed significantly lower scores in participants who were frail OAB vs. frail non-OAB for most of the SF-12v2 scores/sub-component scores. Conclusions These data highlight the statistically significant positive correlation between frailty and OAB among older adults in Japan and may provide valuable information on the burden of OAB and frailty on older adults to healthcare professionals when considering future healthcare planning.",2022,2022-01-21 00:00:00,9.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61d5d4ab9904e78083fc1474bda2af0730455ed5

10.1186/s12935-022-02716-6,The prognostic impact of the immune microenvironment in small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix: PD-L1 and immune cell subtypes,"Background We investigate the correlation between programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor-associated immune cell (TAIC) density in small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix (SCNEC) and their correlation with clinicopathologic features. Methods PD-L1 and mismatch repair protein (MMR) expression in cancer cells and the density of TAIC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 89 SCNEC patients. The combined positive score (CPS), tumor proportion score (TPS), and immune cell score (ICS) of PD-L1 were measured, along with their correlation with clinicopathologic features in SCNEC patients using statistical analyses. Results CPS of PD-L1 ≥ 1 was seen in 68.5% of patients, positive TPS and ICS of PD-L1 were detected in 59.6% and 33.7% of patients, respectively. PD-L1 CPS was higher in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (r = 0.387, p  = 0.001) and positively correlated with programmed cell death-1 and forkhead box P3 + regulatory T cell (FOXP3 + Treg) infiltration (r = 0.443, p  < 0.001; r = 0.532, p  < 0.001). There was no statistical correlation between PD-L1 and MMR status. PD-L1 CPS and PD-L1 ICS positivity were independent prognostic factors, correlating with a favorable survival (HR (95%CI) = 0.363(0.139–0.950), p  = 0.039 and HR (95% CI) = 0.199(0.050–0.802), p  = 0.023, respectively). PD-L1 ICS positivity was an independent indicator of recurrence in SCNEC patients and associated with better disease-free survival (HR (95% CI) = 0.124(0.036–0425), p  = 0.001). TAIC and MMR levels had no statistical impact on survival results. Conclusions PD-L1 positivity was seen in over half of SCNEC tumors. It may work synergistically with FOXP3 + Treg and other infiltrating immune cells to support an adaptive immune response. PD-L1 positivity may be a favorable prognostic factor in SCNEC.",2022,2022-11-14 00:00:00,10.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/767dfa6fa884e729bdc885ab0e9f4b5656b9acb0
10.1186/s12967-022-03732-w,Automatic segmentation of the gross target volume in radiotherapy for lung cancer using transresSEUnet 2.5D Network,"Objective This paper intends to propose a method of using TransResSEUnet2.5D network for accurate automatic segmentation of the Gross Target Volume (GTV) in Radiotherapy for lung cancer. Methods A total of 11,370 computed tomograms (CT), deriving from 137 cases, of lung cancer patients under radiotherapy developed by radiotherapists were used as the training set; 1642 CT images in 20 cases were used as the validation set, and 1685 CT images in 20 cases were used as the test set. The proposed network was tuned and trained to obtain the best segmentation model and its performance was measured by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and with 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95). Lastly, as to demonstrate the accuracy of the automatic segmentation of the network proposed in this study, all possible mirrors of the input images were put into Unet2D, Unet2.5D, Unet3D, ResSEUnet3D, ResSEUnet2.5D, and TransResUnet2.5D, and their respective segmentation performances were compared and assessed. Results The segmentation results of the test set showed that TransResSEUnet2.5D performed the best in the DSC (84.08 ± 0.04) %, HD95 (8.11 ± 3.43) mm and time (6.50 ± 1.31) s metrics compared to the other three networks. Conclusions The TransResSEUnet 2.5D proposed in this study can automatically segment the GTV of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients with more accuracy.",2022,2022-11-12 00:00:00,10.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/99c722455a7510667522a14f6b4a57a51c8e3f76
10.2147/OTT.S352619,EGFR Mutation Status and Subtypes Predicted by CT-Based 3D Radiomic Features in Lung Adenocarcinoma,"Objective In this study, we aim to establish a non-invasive tool to predict epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status and subtypes based on radiomic features of computed tomography (CT). Methods A total of 233 lung adenocarcinoma patients were investigated and randomly divided into the training and test cohorts. In this study, 2300 radiomic features were extracted from original and filtered (Exponential, Laplacian of Gaussian, Logarithm, Gabor, Wavelet) CT images. The radiomic features were divided into four categories, including histogram, volumetric, morphologic, and texture features. An RF-BFE algorithm was developed to select the features for building the prediction models. Clinicopathological features (including age, gender, smoking status, TNM staging, maximum diameter, location, and growth pattern) were combined to establish an integrated model with radiomic features. ROC curve and AUC quantified the effectiveness of the predictor of EGFR mutation status and subtypes. Results A set of 10 features were selected to predict EGFR mutation status between EGFR mutant and wild type, while 9 selected features were used to predict mutation subtypes between exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation. To predict the EGFR mutation status, the AUC of the training cohort was 0.778 and the AUC of the test cohort was 0.765. To predict the EGFR mutation subtypes, the AUC of training cohort was 0.725 and the AUC of test cohort was 0.657. The integrated model showed the most optimal predictive performance with EGFR mutation status (AUC = 0.870 and 0.759) and subtypes (AUC = 0.797 and 0.554) in the training and test cohorts. Conclusion CT-based radiomic features can extract information on tumor heterogeneity in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we have established a radiomic model and an integrated model to non-invasively predict the EGFR mutation status and subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, which is conducive to saving clinical costs and guiding targeted therapy.",2022,2022-05-01 00:00:00,5.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3982d999631bf9cd2f5918791a6f7f02a7583646

The surgical strategy of lymph node dissection is controversial because many more patients are diagnosed at an early stage in clinical practice. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 622 clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma patients with 3 cm or less in tumor size who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy combined with lymph node dissection in our hospital from January 2017 to December 2019. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify preoperative risk factors of lymph node metastasis. Results Lymph node metastasis was found in 60 out of 622 patients. On univariate analysis, lymph node metastasis was linked to smoking history, preoperative CEA level, tumor size, tumor location (peripheral or central), consolidation/tumor ratio, pleural invasion, and pathologic type. However, only the preoperative CEA level, tumor size, and consolidation/tumor ratio were independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. The ROC curve showed that the cutoff value of tumor size was 1.7 cm. There was no lymph node metastasis in patients without risk factors. Conclusions The preoperative CEA level, tumor size, and consolidation/tumor ratio were independent risk factors of lymph node metastasis in clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma with tumor size ≤ 3 cm. The lymph node metastasis rate was extremely low in clinical N0 lung adenocarcinoma patients without risk factors and lymph node dissection should be avoided in these patients to reduce surgical trauma.",2022,2022-04-29 00:00:00,7.0,24.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bd05f8ac78ced4c92a9858af41726a8d67a94db2

10.3390/s22041315,A New Method of Image Classification Based on Domain Adaptation,"Deep neural networks can learn powerful representations from massive amounts of labeled data; however, their performance is unsatisfactory in the case of large samples and small labels. Transfer learning can bridge between a source domain with rich sample data and a target domain with only a few or zero labeled samples and, thus, complete the transfer of knowledge by aligning the distribution between domains through methods, such as domain adaptation. Previous domain adaptation methods mostly align the features in the feature space of all categories on a global scale. Recently, the method of locally aligning the sub-categories by introducing label information achieved better results. Based on this, we present a deep fuzzy domain adaptation (DFDA) that assigns different weights to samples of the same category in the source and target domains, which enhances the domain adaptive capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DFDA can achieve remarkable results on standard domain adaptation datasets.",2022,2022-02-01 00:00:00,4.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5212701214090174156c2ad00c113b83b1ceac4c

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases. Single-cell data are readily integrated with cell atlases using scArches.",2021,2021-08-30 00:00:00,320.0,91.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cec0cf40c589ecaa6d779b8433d96393fdcd9fdc

10.18653/v1/2021.acl-long.336,PairRE: Knowledge Graph Embeddings via Paired Relation Vectors,"Distance based knowledge graph embedding methods show promising results on link prediction task, on which two topics have been widely studied: one is the ability to handle complex relations, such as N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N, the other is to encode various relation patterns, such as symmetry/antisymmetry. However, the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same time, which leads to unsatisfactory results. To mitigate this problem, we propose PairRE, a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. The paired vectors enable an adaptive adjustment of the margin in loss function to fit for different complex relations. Besides, PairRE is capable of encoding three important relation patterns, symmetry/antisymmetry, inverse and composition. Given simple constraints on relation representations, PairRE can encode subrelation further. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities of PairRE.

This study aims to determine the effects of HWs on hospital admissions (HA) in the Edirne province of Turkey. Polyclinic admission and atmospheric data, including daily maximum temperatures, were used. HW is defined as temperature at the % 90 threshold of daily maximum temperatures that persists for at least 3 consecutive days or more. With this definition, a 6-day HW was detected, and a lag of 3 days was added to this HW. Logarithmic Z test was used for the analysis. As a result of the study, The Risk Ratio (RR) showing the relationship between 9-day HW and HAs was calculated as 1.19 (95% confident interval [CI]: 1.17–1.21, P < .05), and it was determined that there were 2557 extra HAs in total. When HAs were analyzed according to sex, it was observed that female admissions were higher than male admissions. To analyze admissions by age, the data were divided into 3 groups: children (<15 years), adult (15–64 years), and elderly (≥65 years). As a result of the analysis, the highest increase was observed in patients < 15 years of age, and the RR was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.24–1.42 P < .05).

This cross-sectional study used QGIS and GeoDa to explore the spatial pattern and heterogeneity of CRDs morbidity and spatial autocorrelation between socio-demographic factors and CRDs in Thailand from 2016 to 2019. We found an annual, positive, spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I >0.66, p<0.001) showing a strong clustered distribution. The local indicators of spatial association (LISA) identified hotspots mostly in the northern region, while coldspots were mostly seen in the central and north-eastern regions throughout the study period. Of the socio-demographic factors, the density of population, households, vehicles, factories and agricultural areas, correlated with the CRD morbidity rate, with statistically significant negative spatial autocorrelations and coldspots in the north-eastern and central areas (except for agricultural land) and two hotspots between farm household density and CRD in the southern region in 2019.

10.1039/d2ra07448f,"Long-term impacts of climate change on coastal and transitional eco-systems in India: an overview of its current status, future projections, solutions, and policies","Urbanization and industrial development are increasing rapidly. These are accompanied by problems of population explosion, encroachment of agricultural, and construction lands, increased waste generation, effluent release, and escalated concentrations of several greenhouse gases (GHGs) and pollutants in the atmosphere. This has led to wide-scale adverse impacts. Visible effects are fluctuations in temperatures and precipitation, rising sea levels, unpredictable floods, storms and cyclones, and disruption to coastal and transitional ecosystems. In a country like India with a massive population of nearly 1.4 billion and around 420 million people dwelling on or near the coasts, this effect is pre-dominant. India has extensive coastlines on both sides that are subject to greater contact and high impact from the water bodies. The factors impacting climate change, its consequences, and future predictions must be analyzed immediately for implementing precautionary measures to ameliorate the detrimental effects. Several endemic species have been endangered as these changes have resulted in the loss of habitat and interfered with the food webs. Climatic impacts on transitional ecosystems also need to be considered to preserve the diversity of each. The cooperation of governmental, independent organizations and policymakers throughout the world is essential to control and mediate the impacts on health, agriculture, and other related sectors, the details of which have been elaborated in this review. The review analyses the trends in climatic variation with time and discusses a few extremities which have left permanent effects on the population primarily concerning the coastal – Indian scenario and its eco-systems.",2023,2023-04-17 00:00:00,39.0,108.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/540bfa375b669516c9e29c3976c02012383184ad
10.1007/s00357-023-09432-4,Local and Overall Deviance R-Squared Measures for Mixtures of Generalized Linear Models,"In generalized linear models (GLMs), measures of lack of fit are typically defined as the deviance between two nested models, and a deviance-based R ^2 is commonly used to evaluate the fit. In this paper, we extend deviance measures to mixtures of GLMs, whose parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) via the EM algorithm. Such measures are defined both locally, i.e., at cluster-level, and globally, i.e., with reference to the whole sample. At the cluster-level, we propose a normalized two-term decomposition of the local deviance into explained, and unexplained local deviances. At the sample-level, we introduce an additive normalized decomposition of the total deviance into three terms, where each evaluates a different aspect of the fitted model: (1) the cluster separation on the dependent variable, (2) the proportion of the total deviance explained by the fitted model, and (3) the proportion of the total deviance which remains unexplained. We use both local and global decompositions to define, respectively, local and overall deviance R ^2 measures for mixtures of GLMs, which we illustrate—for Gaussian, Poisson and binomial responses—by means of a simulation study.

Therefore, the ability to correctly and quickly predict the effect of amino acid mutations is crucial for understanding disease effects and to be able to carry out genome-wide studies. Here, we report a new development of the SAAMBE method, SAAMBE-3D, which is a machine learning-based approach, resulting in accurate predictions and is extremely fast. It achieves the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 0.82 depending on the training protocol in benchmarking five-fold validation test against the SKEMPI v2.0 database and outperforms currently existing algorithms on various blind-tests. Furthermore, optimized and tested via five-fold cross-validation on the Cornell University dataset, the SAAMBE-3D achieves AUC of 1.0 and 0.96 on a homo and hereto-dimer test datasets. Another important feature of SAAMBE-3D is that it is very fast, it takes less than a fraction of a second to complete a prediction. SAAMBE-3D is available as a web server and as well as a stand-alone code, the last one being another important feature allowing other researchers to directly download the code and run it on their local computer. Combined all together, SAAMBE-3D is an accurate and fast software applicable for genome-wide studies to assess the effect of amino acid mutations on protein–protein interactions. The webserver and the stand-alone codes (SAAMBE-3D for predicting the change of binding free energy and SAAMBE-3D-DN for predicting if the mutation is disruptive or non-disruptive) are available.",2020,2020-04-01 00:00:00,69.0,61.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e88829e362d6b8ec8b908a89f9287a5e7d220a48

10.1186/s12859-019-2923-1,DDGun: an untrained method for the prediction of protein stability changes upon single and multiple point variations,"Predicting the effect of single point variations on protein stability constitutes a crucial step toward understanding the relationship between protein structure and function. To this end, several methods have been developed to predict changes in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding (∆∆G) between wild type and variant proteins, using sequence and structure information. Most of the available methods however do not exhibit the anti-symmetric prediction property, which guarantees that the predicted ∆∆G value for a variation is the exact opposite of that predicted for the reverse variation, i.e., ∆∆G(A → B) = −∆∆G(B → A), where A and B are amino acids. Here we introduce simple anti-symmetric features, based on evolutionary information, which are combined to define an untrained method, DDGun (DDG untrained). DDGun is a simple approach based on evolutionary information that predicts the ∆∆G for single and multiple variations from sequence and structure information (DDGun3D). Our method achieves remarkable performance without any training on the experimental datasets, reaching Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and measured ∆∆G values of ~ 0.5 and ~ 0.4 for single and multiple site variations, respectively. Surprisingly, DDGun performances are comparable with those of state of the art methods. DDGun also naturally predicts multiple site variations, thereby defining a benchmark method for both single site and multiple site predictors. DDGun is anti-symmetric by construction predicting the value of the ∆∆G of a reciprocal variation as almost equal (depending on the sequence profile) to -∆∆G of the direct variation. This is a valuable property that is missing in the majority of the methods. Evolutionary information alone combined in an untrained method can achieve remarkably high performances in the prediction of ∆∆G upon protein mutation. Non-trained approaches like DDGun represent a valid benchmark both for scoring the predictive power of the individual features and for assessing the learning capability of supervised methods.",2019,2019-07-01 00:00:00,111.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39c8efb91552463df93c6d8e4e79b084cdc2f9a2

10.3390/s21134605,Received Signal Strength Fingerprinting-Based Indoor Location Estimation Employing Machine Learning,"The fingerprinting technique is a popular approach to reveal location of persons, instruments or devices in an indoor environment. Typically based on signal strength measurement, a power level map is created first in the learning phase to align with measured values in the inference. Second, the location is determined by taking the point for which the recorded received power level is closest to the power level actually measured. The biggest limit of this technique is the reliability of power measurements, which may lack accuracy in many wireless systems. To this end, this work extends the power level measurement by using multiple anchors and multiple radio channels and, consequently, considers different approaches to aligning the actual measurements with the recorded values. The dataset is available online. This article focuses on the very popular radio technology Bluetooth Low Energy to explore the possible improvement of the system accuracy through different machine learning approaches. It shows how the accuracy–complexity trade-off influences the possible candidate algorithms on an example of three-channel Bluetooth received signal strength based fingerprinting in a one dimensional environment with four static anchors and in a two dimensional environment with the same set of anchors. We provide a literature survey to identify the machine learning algorithms applied in the literature to show that the studies available can not be compared directly. Then, we implement and analyze the performance of four most popular supervised learning techniques, namely k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932024,New Reconstructed Database for Cost Reduction in Indoor Fingerprinting Localization,"Location fingerprinting is a technique widely suggested for challenging indoor positioning. Despite the significant benefits of this technique, it needs a considerable amount of time and energy to measure the Received Signal Strength (RSS) at Reference Points (RPs) and build a fingerprinting database to achieve an appropriate localization accuracy. Reducing the number of RPs can reduce this cost, but it noticeably degrades the accuracy of positioning. In order to alleviate this problem, this paper takes the interior architecture of the indoor area and signal propagation effects into account and proposes two novel recovery methods for creating the reconstructed database instead of the measured one. They only need a few numbers of RPs to reconstruct the database and even are able to produce a denser database. The first method is a new zone-based path-loss propagation model which employs fingerprints of different zones separately and the second one is a new interpolation method, zone-based Weighted Ring-based (WRB). The proposed methods are compared with the conventional path-loss model and six interpolation functions. Two different test environments along with a benchmarking testbed, and various RPs configurations are also utilized to verify the proposed recovery methods, based on the reconstruction errors and the localization accuracies they provide. The results indicate that by taking only 11% of the initial RPs, the new zone-based path-loss model decreases the localization error up to 26% compared to the conventional path-loss model and the proposed zone-based WRB method outperforms all the other interpolation methods and improves the accuracy by 40%.",2019,2019-07-30 00:00:00,34.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3a395d600ffe3af7a232af93dbea6505143ab21

10.1093/gigascience/giab065,SimFFPE and FilterFFPE: improving structural variant calling in FFPE samples,"Abstract Background Artifact chimeric reads are enriched in next-generation sequencing data generated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Previous work indicated that these reads are characterized by erroneous split-read support that is interpreted as evidence of structural variants. Thus, a large number of false-positive structural variants are detected. To our knowledge, no tool is currently available to specifically call or filter structural variants in FFPE samples. To overcome this gap, we developed 2 R packages: SimFFPE and FilterFFPE. Results SimFFPE is a read simulator, specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data from FFPE samples. A mixture of characteristic artifact chimeric reads, as well as normal reads, is generated. FilterFFPE is a filtration algorithm, removing artifact chimeric reads from sequencing data while keeping real chimeric reads. To evaluate the performance of FilterFFPE, we performed structural variant calling with 3 common tools (Delly, Lumpy, and Manta) with and without prior filtration with FilterFFPE. After applying FilterFFPE, the mean positive predictive value improved from 0.27 to 0.48 in simulated samples and from 0.11 to 0.27 in real samples, while sensitivity remained basically unchanged or even slightly increased. Conclusions FilterFFPE improves the performance of SV calling in FFPE samples.

10.1038/s41598-020-60559-5,Systematic comparison of somatic variant calling performance among different sequencing depth and mutation frequency,"In the past decade, treatments for tumors have made remarkable progress, such as the successful clinical application of targeted therapies. Nowadays, targeted therapies are based primarily on the detection of mutations, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) plays an important role in relevant clinical research. The mutation frequency is a major problem in tumor mutation detection and increasing sequencing depth is a widely used method to improve mutation calling performance. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of different sequencing depth and mutation frequency as well as mutation calling tools. In this study, Strelka2 and Mutect2 tools were used in detecting the performance of 30 combinations of sequencing depth and mutation frequency. Results showed that the precision rate kept greater than 95% in most of the samples. Generally, for higher mutation frequency (≥20%), sequencing depth ≥200X is sufficient for calling 95% mutations; for lower mutation frequency (≤10%), we recommend improving experimental method rather than increasing sequencing depth. Besides, according to our results, although Strelka2 and Mutect2 performed similarly, the former performed slightly better than the latter one at higher mutation frequency (≥20%), while Mutect2 performed better when the mutation frequency was lower than 10%. Besides, Strelka2 was 17 to 22 times faster than Mutect2 on average. Our research will provide a useful and comprehensive guideline for clinical genomic researches on somatic mutation identification through systematic performance comparison among different sequencing depths and mutation frequency.",2020,2020-02-26 00:00:00,53.0,57.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fa5cd0160b04325737e3ed0e4b00b9ec42dd007
10.1186/s12920-020-00746-5,Comparative analysis of somatic variant calling on matched FF and FFPE WGS samples,"Research grade Fresh Frozen (FF) DNA material is not yet routinely collected in clinical practice. Many hospitals, however, collect and store Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Consequently, the sample size of whole genome cancer cohort studies could be increased tremendously by including FFPE samples, although the presence of artefacts might obfuscate the variant calling. To assess whether FFPE material can be used for cohort studies, we performed an in-depth comparison of somatic SNVs called on matching FF and FFPE Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) samples extracted from the same tumor. Four variant callers (i.e. Strelka2, Mutect2, VarScan2 and Shimmer) were used to call somatic variants on matching FF and FFPE WGS samples from a metastatic prostate tumor. Using the variants identified by these callers, we developed a heuristic to maximize the overlap between the FF and its FFPE counterpart in terms of sensitivity and precision. The proposed variant calling approach was then validated on nine matched primary samples. Finally, we assessed what fraction of the discrepancy could be attributed to intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), by comparing the overlap in clonal and subclonal somatic variants. We first compared variants between an FF and an FFPE sample from a metastatic prostate tumor, showing that on average 50% of the calls in the FF are recovered in the FFPE sample, with notable differences between callers. Combining the variants of the different callers using a simple heuristic, increases both the precision and the sensitivity of the variant calling. Validating the heuristic on nine additional matched FF-FFPE samples, resulted in an average F1-score of 0.58 and an outperformance of any of the individual callers. In addition, we could show that part of the discrepancy between the FF and the FFPE samples can be attributed to ITH. This study illustrates that when using the correct variant calling strategy, the majority of clonal SNVs can be recovered in an FFPE sample with high precision and sensitivity. These results suggest that somatic variants derived from WGS of FFPE material can be used in cohort studies.",2020,2020-01-16 00:00:00,13.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c969b021a7bb9df48e017151d2a37fa9a17418e

10.3389/fonc.2019.00119,Leveraging Spatial Variation in Tumor Purity for Improved Somatic Variant Calling of Archival Tumor Only Samples,"Archival tumor samples represent a rich resource of annotated specimens for translational genomics research. However, standard variant calling approaches require a matched normal sample from the same individual, which is often not available in the retrospective setting, making it difficult to distinguish between true somatic variants and individual-specific germline variants. Archival sections often contain adjacent normal tissue, but this tissue can include infiltrating tumor cells. As existing comparative somatic variant callers are designed to exclude variants present in the normal sample, a novel approach is required to leverage adjacent normal tissue with infiltrating tumor cells for somatic variant calling. Here we present lumosVar 2.0, a software package designed to jointly analyze multiple samples from the same patient, built upon our previous single sample tumor only variant caller lumosVar 1.0. The approach assumes that the allelic fraction of somatic variants and germline variants follow different patterns as tumor content and copy number state change. lumosVar 2.0 estimates allele specific copy number and tumor sample fractions from the data, and uses a to model to determine expected allelic fractions for somatic and germline variants and to classify variants accordingly. To evaluate the utility of lumosVar 2.0 to jointly call somatic variants with tumor and adjacent normal samples, we used a glioblastoma dataset with matched high and low tumor content and germline whole exome sequencing data (for true somatic variants) available for each patient. Both sensitivity and positive predictive value were improved when analyzing the high tumor and low tumor samples jointly compared to analyzing the samples individually or in-silico pooling of the two samples. Finally, we applied this approach to a set of breast and prostate archival tumor samples for which tumor blocks containing adjacent normal tissue were available for sequencing. Joint analysis using lumosVar 2.0 detected several variants, including known cancer hotspot mutations that were not detected by standard somatic variant calling tools using the adjacent tissue as presumed normal reference. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of leveraging paired tissue samples to improve somatic variant calling when a constitutional sample is not available.",2019,2019-03-20 00:00:00,14.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a9e70746d6d2fca43b880e2f274c0a019cf6901
10.1093/nar/gky1142,Sources of erroneous sequences and artifact chimeric reads in next generation sequencing of genomic DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples,"Abstract Tissues used in pathology laboratories are typically stored in the form of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. One important consideration in repurposing FFPE material for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis is the sequencing artifacts that can arise from the significant damage to nucleic acids due to treatment with formalin, storage at room temperature and extraction. One such class of artifacts consists of chimeric reads that appear to be derived from non-contiguous portions of the genome. Here, we show that a major proportion of such chimeric reads align to both the ‘Watson’ and ‘Crick’ strands of the reference genome. We refer to these as strand-split artifact reads (SSARs). This study provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic basis of the genesis of SSARs and other chimeric artifacts along with supporting experimental evidence, which have led to approaches to reduce the levels of such artifacts. We demonstrate that one of these approaches, involving S1 nuclease-mediated removal of single-stranded fragments and overhangs, also reduces sequence bias, base error rates, and false positive detection of copy number and single nucleotide variants. Finally, we describe an analytical approach for quantifying SSARs from NGS data.",2018,2018-11-12 00:00:00,58.0,18.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3bcbbda66a2159f378b060ed33752d5d42657c72

10.1101/2020.09.18.20192815,Exome sequencing identifies rare coding variants in 10 genes which confer substantial risk for schizophrenia,"By meta-analyzing the whole-exomes of 24,248 cases and 97,322 controls, we implicate ultra-rare coding variants (URVs) in ten genes as conferring substantial risk for schizophrenia (odds ratios 3 - 50, P < 2.14 x 10^-6), and 32 genes at a FDR < 5%. These genes have the greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have diverse molecular functions that include the formation, structure, and function of the synapse. The associations of NMDA receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for the dysfunction of the glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We find significant evidence for an overlap of rare variant risk between schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and severe neurodevelopmental disorders (DD/ID), supporting a neurodevelopmental etiology for schizophrenia. We show that protein-truncating variants in GRIN2A, TRIO, and CACNA1G confer risk for schizophrenia whereas specific missense mutations in these genes confer risk for DD/ID. Nevertheless, few of the strongly associated schizophrenia genes appear to confer risk for DD/ID. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare variant risk, suggesting that common and rare genetic risk factors at least partially converge on the same underlying pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry a substantial excess of URVs, implying that more schizophrenia risk genes await discovery using this approach.",2020,2020-09-18 00:00:00,108.0,80.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0700d2bf8e5a7f57f262a574f1d6005795936054

In this study, we conducted a TWAS using gene expression data from GTEx and summary statistics from the hitherto largest GWAS meta-analysis conducted for breast cancer overall, and by estrogen receptor subtypes (ER+ and ER−). We further compared associations with ER+ and ER− subtypes, using a case-only TWAS approach. We also conducted multigene conditional analyses in regions with multiple TWAS associations. Two genes, STXBP4 and HIST2H2BA, were specifically associated with ER+ but not with ER− breast cancer. We further identified 30 TWAS-significant genes associated with overall breast cancer risk, including four that were not identified in previous studies.

The current availability of hundreds of GWASs provides a unique opportunity to address these questions. We systematically analyzed 4,155 publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWASs on 558 traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and genetic architecture. We show that trait-associated loci cover more than half of the genome, and 90% of these overlap with loci from multiple traits. We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits. Our results provide insights into how genetic variation contributes to trait variation. All GWAS results can be queried and visualized at the GWAS ATLAS resource (https://atlas.ctglab.nl).

At the same time, the tremendous growth in the popularity and usage of social media, such as Twitter, has resulted on an immense increase in user-generated data, as mainly represented by the corresponding texts in users’ posts. However, the analysis of these specific data and the extraction of actionable knowledge and added value out of them is a challenging task due to the domain diversity and the high multilingualism that characterizes these data. The latter highlights the emerging need for the implementation and utilization of domain-agnostic and multilingual solutions. To investigate a portion of these challenges this research work performs a comparative analysis of multilingual approaches for classifying both the sentiment and the text of an examined multilingual corpus. In this context, four multilingual BERT-based classifiers and a zero-shot classification approach are utilized and compared in terms of their accuracy and applicability in the classification of multilingual data. Their comparison has unveiled insightful outcomes and has a twofold interpretation. Multilingual BERT-based classifiers achieve high performances and transfer inference when trained and fine-tuned on multilingual data. While also the zero-shot approach presents a novel technique for creating multilingual solutions in a faster, more efficient, and scalable way. It can easily be fitted to new languages and new tasks while achieving relatively good results across many languages. However, when efficiency and scalability are less important than accuracy, it seems that this model, and zero-shot models in general, can not be compared to fine-tuned and trained multilingual BERT-based classifiers.",2023,2023-05-08 00:00:00,37.0,60.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f8ee05074a3724434e6b5dcf4aac7ebdee0c6ff

10.3390/info12080331,A Survey on Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining in Greek Social Media,"As the amount of content that is created on social media is constantly increasing, more and more opinions and sentiments are expressed by people in various subjects. In this respect, sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques can be valuable for the automatic analysis of huge textual corpora (comments, reviews, tweets etc.). Despite the advances in text mining algorithms, deep learning techniques, and text representation models, the results in such tasks are very good for only a few high-density languages (e.g., English) that possess large training corpora and rich linguistic resources; nevertheless, there is still room for improvement for the other lower-density languages as well. In this direction, the current work employs various language models for representing social media texts and text classifiers in the Greek language, for detecting the polarity of opinions expressed on social media. The experimental results on a related dataset collected by the authors of the current work are promising, since various classifiers based on the language models (naive bayesian, random forests, support vector machines, logistic regression, deep feed-forward neural networks) outperform those of word or sentence-based embeddings (word2vec, GloVe), achieving a classification accuracy of more than 80%. Additionally, a new language model for Greek social media has also been trained on the aforementioned dataset, proving that language models based on domain specific corpora can improve the performance of generic language models by a margin of 2%.

Habitat mapping relies on seafloor classification typically based on acoustic methods, and ground truthing through direct sampling and optical imaging. With the increasing capabilities to record high-resolution underwater images, manual approaches for analyzing these images to create seafloor classifications are no longer feasible. Automated workflows have been proposed as a solution, in which algorithms assign pre-defined seafloor categories to each image. However, in order to provide consistent and repeatable analysis, these automated workflows need to address e.g., underwater illumination artefacts, variances in resolution and class-imbalances, which could bias the classification. Here, we present a generic implementation of an Automated and Integrated Seafloor Classification Workflow (AI-SCW). The workflow aims to classify the seafloor into habitat categories based on automated analysis of optical underwater images with only minimal amount of human annotations. AI-SCW incorporates laser point detection for scale determination and color normalization. It further includes semi-automatic generation of the training data set for fitting the seafloor classifier. As a case study, we applied the workflow to an example seafloor image dataset from the Belgian and German contract areas for Manganese-nodule exploration in the Pacific Ocean. Based on this, we provide seafloor classifications along the camera deployment tracks, and discuss results in the context of seafloor multibeam bathymetry. Our results show that the seafloor in the Belgian area predominantly comprises densely distributed nodules, which are intermingled with qualitatively larger-sized nodules at local elevations and within depressions. On the other hand, the German area primarily comprises nodules that only partly cover the seabed, and these occur alongside turned-over sediment (artificial seafloor) that were caused by the settling plume following a dredging experiment conducted in the area.",2022,2022-09-12 00:00:00,6.0,83.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3bea8562d3983d315eadc847535cebae1f6ac8a6

Nevertheless, the complexity and non-linear behaviour associated with such kind of energy systems hinder the development of accurate algorithms. In such a context, this paper investigates the use of a state-of-art deep learning architecture in order to perform precise load demand forecasting 24-h-ahead in the whole country of France using RTE data. To this end, the authors propose an encoder-decoder architecture inspired by WaveNet, a deep generative model initially designed by Google DeepMind for raw audio waveforms. WaveNet uses dilated causal convolutions and skip-connection to utilise long-term information. This kind of novel ML architecture presents different advantages regarding other statistical algorithms. On the one hand, the proposed deep learning model’s training process can be parallelized in GPUs, which is an advantage in terms of training times compared to recurrent networks. On the other hand, the model prevents degradations problems (explosions and vanishing gradients) due to the residual connections. In addition, this model can learn from an input sequence to produce a forecast sequence in a one-shot manner. For comparison purposes, a comparative analysis between the most performing state-of-art deep learning models and traditional statistical approaches is presented: Autoregressive-Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-Short-Term-Memory, Gated-Recurrent-Unit (GRU), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), causal 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) and ConvLSTM (Encoder-Decoder).

An accurate prediction of power load can provide a reliable decision for power system management. To solve the limitation of the existing load forecasting methods in dealing with time-series data, causing the poor stability and non-ideal forecasting accuracy, this paper proposed an attention-based encoder-decoder network with Bayesian optimization to do the accurate short-term power load forecasting. Proposed model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with a gated recurrent units (GRU) recurrent neural network with high robustness on time-series data modeling. The temporal attention layer focuses on the key features of input data that play a vital role in promoting the prediction accuracy for load forecasting. Finally, the Bayesian optimization method is used to confirm the model’s hyperparameters to achieve optimal predictions.

Moreover, a push for electrical vehicle and other economic developments are expected to further increase energy use. To combat these challenges, electrical load forecasting is essential as it supports energy production planning and scheduling, assists with budgeting, and helps identify saving opportunities. Machine learning approaches commonly used for energy forecasting such as feedforward neural networks and support vector regression encounter challenges with capturing time dependencies. Consequently, this paper proposes Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Network (S2S RNN) with Attention for electrical load forecasting. The S2S architecture from language translation is adapted for load forecasting and a corresponding sample generation approach is designed. RNN enables capturing time dependencies present in the load data and S2S model further improves time modeling by combining two RNNs: encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism alleviates the burden of connecting encoder and decoder. The experiments evaluated attention mechanisms with different RNN cells (vanilla, LSTM, and GRU) and with varied time horizons. Results show that S2S with Bahdanau attention outperforms other models.

Since high levels of uncertainties exist in the load time series, it is a challenging task to make accurate short-term load forecast (STLF). In recent years, deep learning approaches provide better performance to predict electrical load in real world cases. The convolutional neural network (CNN) can extract the local trend and capture the same pattern, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed to learn the relationship in time steps. In this paper, a new deep neural network framework that integrates the hidden feature of the CNN model and the LSTM model is proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy. The proposed model was tested in a real-world case, and detailed experiments were conducted to validate its practicality and stability. The forecasting performance of the proposed model was compared with the LSTM model and the CNN model.

10.3390/EN11071636,Optimal Deep Learning LSTM Model for Electric Load Forecasting using Feature Selection and Genetic Algorithm: Comparison with Machine Learning Approaches †,"Background: With the development of smart grids, accurate electric load forecasting has become increasingly important as it can help power companies in better load scheduling and reduce excessive electricity production. However, developing and selecting accurate time series models is a challenging task as this requires training several different models for selecting the best amongst them along with substantial feature engineering to derive informative features and finding optimal time lags, a commonly used input features for time series models. Methods: Our approach uses machine learning and a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network with various configurations to construct forecasting models for short to medium term aggregate load forecasting. The research solves above mentioned problems by training several linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms and picking the best as baseline, choosing best features using wrapper and embedded feature selection methods and finally using genetic algorithm (GA) to find optimal time lags and number of layers for LSTM model predictive performance optimization. Results: Using France metropolitan’s electricity consumption data as a case study, obtained results show that LSTM based model has shown high accuracy then machine learning model that is optimized with hyperparameter tuning. Using the best features, optimal lags, layers and training various LSTM configurations further improved forecasting accuracy.

A fundamental yet understudied problem in this area is finding an optimal data representation for processing athlete trajectories using machine learning algorithms. In the present work, we address this gap by discussing common representations in use and propose Tactical Graphs , an alternative graph-based format capable of producing integrative, contextualized models for machine learning applications. We provide an in-depth, domain-specific motivation of the proposed data representation scheme and show how this approach exploits inherent data traits. We propose Tactical Graph Networks (TGNets), a light-weight, hybrid machine learning architecture sensitive to player interactions. Our method is evaluated with an extensive ablation study and the first comprehensive state of the art comparison between standard feature, state vector, and image-based methods on the same dataset. Experiments were conducted using real-world football data containing short sequences of defensive play labelled according to the outcome of ball winning attempts. The results indicate that TGNets are on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models while exhibiting only a fraction of their complexity.

The traditional physical education monitoring environment creates crucial manual efforts on athletes' activity observations and tracking consistently. Similarly, remote monitoring and assessment of athletes in sports training seem to be barriers to physical education monitoring and training.

As a result, basketball is an ideal domain to work on different data analysis techniques to gain useful insights. In this study, we continued our previous study published in 2020 Computational Collective Intelligence (12th International Conference, ICCCI 2020, Da Nang, Vietnam, November 30 – December 3, 2020, Proceedings) reviewing some important factors to predict players’ future performance and being selected in an All-Star game, one of the most prestigious events, of National Basket Association league. Besides traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning is also applied in this study for prediction purpose. However, compared to traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning’s performance is not as good for our dataset. It is understandable when our data are relatively small and structured with a few predictor variables which limited Deep Learning’s ability to deal with a vast amount of Big Data.

10.3390/rs15163999,Exploring Random Forest Machine Learning and Remote Sensing Data for Streamflow Prediction: An Alternative Approach to a Process-Based Hydrologic Modeling in a Snowmelt-Driven Watershed,"Physically based hydrologic models require significant effort and extensive information for development, calibration, and validation. The study explored the use of the random forest regression (RFR), a supervised machine learning (ML) model, as an alternative to the physically based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for predicting streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters near Del Norte, a snowmelt-dominated mountainous watershed of the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Remotely sensed data were used for the random forest machine learning analysis (RFML) and RStudio for data processing and synthesizing. The RFML model outperformed the SWAT model in accuracy and demonstrated its capability in predicting streamflow in this region. We implemented a customized approach to the RFR model to assess the model’s performance for three training periods, across 1991–2010, 1996–2010, and 2001–2010; the results indicated that the model’s accuracy improved with longer training periods, implying that the model trained on a more extended period is better able to capture the parameters’ variability and reproduce streamflow data more accurately. The variable importance (i.e., IncNodePurity) measure of the RFML model revealed that the snow depth and the minimum temperature were consistently the top two predictors across all training periods. The paper also evaluated how well the SWAT model performs in reproducing streamflow data of the watershed with a conventional approach. The SWAT model needed more time and data to set up and calibrate, delivering acceptable performance in annual mean streamflow simulation, with satisfactory index of agreement (d), coefficient of determination (R2), and percent bias (PBIAS) values, but monthly simulation warrants further exploration and model adjustments. The study recommends exploring snowmelt runoff hydrologic processes, dust-driven sublimation effects, and more detailed topographic input parameters to update the SWAT snowmelt routine for better monthly flow estimation. The results provide a critical analysis for enhancing streamflow prediction, which is valuable for further research and water resource management, including snowmelt-driven semi-arid regions.",2023,2023-08-11 00:00:00,20.0,107.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff3900344bb26b5820f482fe889f59787da01fed

10.3390/w14111828,Multi-Variables-Driven Model Based on Random Forest and Gaussian Process Regression for Monthly Streamflow Forecasting,"Due to the inherent non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of original streamflow and the complicated relationship between multi-scale predictors and streamflow, accurate and reliable monthly streamflow forecasting is quite difficult. In this paper, a multi-scale-variables-driven streamflow forecasting (MVDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy and provide more information for decision-making. This framework was realized by integrating random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with multi-scale variables (hydrometeorological and climate predictors) as inputs and is referred to as RF-GPR-MV. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the RF-GPR-MV model, it was implemented for multi-step-ahead monthly streamflow forecasts with horizons of 1 to 12 months for two key hydrological stations in the Jinsha River basin, Southwest China. Other MVDSF models based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and GPR with/without multi-scale variables or the PCC and a backpropagation neural network (BP) or general regression neural network (GRNN), with only previous streamflow and precipitation, namely, PCC-GPR-MV, PCC-GPR-QP, PCC-BP-QP, and PCC-GRNN-QP, respectively, were selected as benchmarks. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model was superior to the other benchmark models in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for almost all forecasting scenarios, especially for forecasting with longer lead times. Additionally, the results also confirmed that the addition of large-scale climate and circulation factors was beneficial for promoting the streamflow forecasting ability, with an average contribution rate of about 15%. The RF in the MVDSF framework improved the forecasting performance, with an average contribution rate of about 25%. This improvement was more pronounced when the lead time exceeded 3 months. Moreover, the proposed model could also provide prediction intervals (PIs) to characterize forecast uncertainty, as supplementary information to further help decision makers in relevant departments to avoid risks in water resources management.",2022,2022-06-06 00:00:00,22.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c57b2d4dd51fe40e5b7266dcd750af64f79f5c3

Due to this, the study of SF prediction is highly significant for the purpose of municipal and environmental damage mitigation. In the present study, machine learning (ML) models based on the support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are tested and developed to predict SF for 11 different rivers throughout Peninsular Malaysia. SF data sets for the rivers were collected from the Malaysian Department of Irrigation and Drainage. The main objective of the present study is to propose a universal model that is most capable of predicting SFs for rivers within Peninsular Malaysia. Based on the findings, the ANN3 model which was developed using the ANN algorithm and input scenario 3 (inputs consisting of previous 3 days SF) is deduced as the best overall ML model for SF prediction as it outperformed all the other models in 4 out of 11 of the tested data sets; and obtained among the highest average RMs with a score of 3.27, hence indicating that the model is very adaptable and reliable in accurately predicting SF based on different data sets and river case studies.

Herein OCE was applied to evaluate previously inaccessible biomechanical characteristics of human corneal tissue and to study the role of Bowman's layer in corneal biomechanics. Methods Human corneal donor buttons (n = 23) were obtained and Descemet's membrane and endothelium were removed. In 11 corneas, Bowman's layer was ablated by a 20 µm stromal excimer laser ablation. Buttons were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber and subjected to a pressure modulation from 10 to 30 mm Hg, and back to 10 mm Hg, in steps of 1 mm Hg. At each step, a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scan was obtained. Displacements were analyzed by optical flow tracking, and strain over the entire stromal depth was retrieved from the phase gradient of the complex interference signal. Results During pressure increase, corneal tissue moved upward (486–585 nm/mm Hg) but did not fully recover (Δ= 2.63 to 8.64 µm) after pressure decrease. Vertical corneal strain distribution was negative in the anterior and positive in the posterior cornea, indicating simultaneous corneal compression and expansion, respectively. Bowman's layer caused minor localized differences in corneal strain distribution. Conclusions Corneal strain distribution is more complex than previously assumed, with a fundamental difference in mechanical response between the anterior and posterior stroma. Clinically, OCE technology might be used to monitor the progression of corneal ectatic diseases and to determine the success of corneal cross-linking.",2020,2020-06-01 00:00:00,24.0,34.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d5948b3e81ceefd48de302234f9499688e36711

10.3389/fpubh.2021.619429,Predicting the Risk of Hypertension Based on Several Easy-to-Collect Risk Factors: A Machine Learning Method,"Hypertension is a widespread chronic disease. Risk prediction of hypertension is an intervention that contributes to the early prevention and management of hypertension. The implementation of such intervention requires an effective and easy-to-implement hypertension risk prediction model. This study evaluated and compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms on predicting the risk of hypertension based on easy-to-collect risk factors. A dataset of 29,700 samples collected through a physical examination was used for model training and testing. Firstly, we identified easy-to-collect risk factors of hypertension, through univariate logistic regression analysis. Then, based on the selected features, 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to optimize four models, random forest (RF), CatBoost, MLP neural network and logistic regression (LR), to find the best hyper-parameters on the training set. Finally, the performance of models was evaluated by AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on the test set. The experimental results showed that the RF model outperformed the other three models, and achieved an AUC of 0.92, an accuracy of 0.82, a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.81. In addition, Body Mass Index (BMI), age, family history and waist circumference (WC) are the four primary risk factors of hypertension. These findings reveal that it is feasible to use machine learning algorithms, especially RF, to predict hypertension risk without clinical or genetic data. The technique can provide a non-invasive and economical way for the prevention and management of hypertension in a large population.",2021,2021-09-24 00:00:00,33.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e24c87ea6ebb4a8ff106e1e173708f2f807398c1
10.1371/journal.pone.0240370,Predicting hypertension using machine learning: Findings from Qatar Biobank Study,"Background and objective Hypertension, a global burden, is associated with several risk factors and can be treated by lifestyle modifications and medications. Prediction and early diagnosis is important to prevent related health complications. The objective is to construct and compare predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using 987 records of Qataris and long-term residents aged 18+ years from Qatar Biobank. Percentages were used to summarize data and chi-square tests to assess associations. Predictive models of hypertension were constructed and compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of algorithms was assessed using accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Stata and Weka were used for analysis. Results Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother’s history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. All algorithms showed more or less similar performances: Random forest (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.4%, sensitivity = 82.1%), logistic regression (accuracy = 81.1%, PPV = 80.1%, sensitivity = 81.1%) and decision tree (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.2%, sensitivity = 82.1%. In terms of AUC, compared to logistic regression, while random forest performed similarly, decision tree had a significantly lower discrimination ability (p-value<0.05) with AUC’s equal to 85.0, 86.9, and 79.9, respectively.

10.1198/tech.2003.s770,The Elements of Statistical Learning,"Chapter 11 includes more case studies in other areas, ranging from manufacturing to marketing research. Chapter 12 concludes the book with some commentary about the scienti c contributions of MTS. The Taguchi method for design of experiment has generated considerable controversy in the statistical community over the past few decades. The MTS/MTGS method seems to lead another source of discussions on the methodology it advocates (Montgomery 2003). As pointed out by Woodall et al. (2003), the MTS/MTGS methods are considered ad hoc in the sense that they have not been developed using any underlying statistical theory. Because the “normal” and “abnormal” groups form the basis of the theory, some sampling restrictions are fundamental to the applications. First, it is essential that the “normal” sample be uniform, unbiased, and/or complete so that a reliable measurement scale is obtained. Second, the selection of “abnormal” samples is crucial to the success of dimensionality reduction when OAs are used. For example, if each abnormal item is really unique in the medical example, then it is unclear how the statistical distance MD can be guaranteed to give a consistent diagnosis measure of severity on a continuous scale when the larger-the-better type S/N ratio is used. Multivariate diagnosis is not new to Technometrics readers and is now becoming increasingly more popular in statistical analysis and data mining for knowledge discovery. As a promising alternative that assumes no underlying data model, The Mahalanobis–Taguchi Strategy does not provide suf cient evidence of gains achieved by using the proposed method over existing tools. Readers may be very interested in a detailed comparison with other diagnostic tools, such as logistic regression and tree-based methods. Overall, although the idea of MTS/MTGS is intriguing, this book would be more valuable had it been written in a rigorous fashion as a technical reference. There is some lack of precision even in several mathematical notations. Perhaps a follow-up with additional theoretical justi cation and careful case studies would answer some of the lingering questions.",2003,2003-08-01 00:00:00,17858.0,7.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0

Here, we report assessments of RNA structure predictions in CASP15, the first CASP exercise that involved RNA structure modeling. Forty two predictor groups submitted models for at least one of twelve RNA-containing targets. These models were evaluated by the RNA-Puzzles organizers and, separately, by a CASP-recruited team using metrics (GDT, lDDT) and approaches (Z-score rankings) initially developed for assessment of proteins and generalized here for RNA assessment. The two assessments independently ranked the same predictor groups as first (AIchemy_RNA2), second (Chen), and third (RNAPolis and GeneSilico, tied); predictions from deep learning approaches were significantly worse than these top ranked groups, which did not use deep learning. Further analyses based on direct comparison of predicted models to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps and X-ray diffraction data support these rankings. With the exception of two RNA-protein complexes, models submitted by CASP15 groups correctly predicted the global fold of the RNA targets. Comparisons of CASP15 submissions to designed RNA nanostructures as well as molecular replacement trials highlight the potential utility of current RNA modeling approaches for RNA nanotechnology and structural biology, respectively.

However, accurate modeling of 3D RNA structure remains a challenging problem. Here we present a novel method, DRfold, to predict RNA tertiary structures by simultaneous learning of local frame rotations and geometric restraints from experimentally solved RNA structures, where the learned knowledge is converted into a hybrid energy potential to guide subsequent RNA structure constructions. The method significantly outperforms previous approaches by >75.6% in TM-score on a nonredundant dataset containing recently released structures. Detailed analyses showed that the major contribution to the improvements arise from the deep end-to-end learning supervised with the atom coordinates and the composite energy function integrating complementary information from geometry restraints and end-to-end learning models.

10.1101/2022.10.24.513506,Accurate de novo prediction of RNA 3D structure with transformer network,"RNA 3D structure prediction remains challenging though after years of efforts. Inspired by the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction, we developed trRosettaRNA, a novel deep learning-based approach to de novo prediction of RNA 3D structure. Like trRosetta, the trRosettaRNA pipeline comprises two major steps: 1D and 2D geometries prediction by a transformer network; and full-atom 3D structure folding by energy minimization with constraints from the predicted geometries. We benchmarked trRosettaRNA on two independent datasets. The results show that trRosettaRNA outperforms other conventional methods by a large margin. For example, on 25 targets from the RNA-Puzzles experiments, the mean RMSD of the models predicted by trRosettaRNA is 5.5 Å, compared with 10.5 Å from the state-of-the-art human group (i.e., Das). Further comparisons with two recently released deep learning-based methods (i.e., DeepFoldRNA and RoseTTAFoldNA) show that all three methods have similar accuracy. However, trRosettaRNA yields more accurate and physically more realistic side-chain atoms than DeepFoldRNA and RoseTTAFoldNA. Finally, we apply trRosettaRNA to predict the structures for the Rfam families that do not have known structures. Analysis shows that for 263 families, the predicted structure models are estimated to be accurate with RMSD < 4 Å.

The proposed system integrates feature importance-based methodologies with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to offer a comprehensive comprehension of the predictive and preventive healthcare recommendations. The framework commences by conducting an in-depth examination of the present condition of Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare sector, as well as the importance of predictive and preventive healthcare. The literature review examines the difficulties related to the comprehensibility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare field and presents feature importance-based approaches and LIME as potential remedies. The focus is on the hybrid approach that combines these techniques, as it has the potential to offer precise predictions while also ensuring a strong level of interpretability. The methodology section delineates the procedure for gathering healthcare data and IoT sensor data, subsequently followed by preprocessing measures such as data cleansing and feature engineering. The predictive models undergo a process of selection, training, and evaluation, with the primary objective of attaining a notable accuracy level of 0.961. This text provides a detailed explanation of how the combination of feature importance-based approaches and LIME improves the transparency and interpretability of the model. An extensive case study is provided to illustrate the implementation of the suggested framework in an actual situation.

Aiming at the difficulty in fault characteristics extraction and fault modes classification of the three-phase full-bridge inverter (TFI) that used as the drive module of brushless DC motor (BLDCM). A hybrid convolutional neural network (HCNN) model consists of one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) and two-dimensional CNN (2D-CNN) is proposed in this paper, which can tap more effective spatial feature for TFI fault diagnosis. The frequency spectrum from the three-phase current signal preprocess are applied as the input for 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN to conduct feature extraction, respectively. Then, the feature layers information are combined in the fully connected layer of HCNN. Finally, the performance status of TFI could be identified by the softmax classifier with Adam optimizer. Several groups of experiments have been studied when the BLDCM under different operating conditions. The results show that the fusion features can get a higher degree of discrimination so as to the presented network model also obtains better classification accuracy, which verify the feasibility and superiority to the other networks.",2021,2021-04-03 00:00:00,36.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d0bec7a00bb589f183ac306da39345d6f363e31

Objective The objective of this study was to develop a new method, based on an app for mobile phones called e-EPIDEMIOLOGY, which was designed to collect individual consumption data for a series of foods/drinks, and to compare this app with a previously validated paper food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Methods University students >18 years of age recorded the consumption of certain foods/drinks using e-EPIDEMIOLOGY during 28 consecutive days and then filled out a paper FFQ at the end of the study period. To evaluate the agreement between the categories of habitual consumption for each of the foods/drinks included in the study, cross-classification analysis and a weighted kappa statistic were used. Results A total of 119 participants completed the study (71% female, 85/119; 29% male, 34/119). Cross-classification analysis showed that 79.8% of the participants were correctly classified into the same category and just 1.1% were misclassified into opposite categories. The average weighted kappa statistic was good (κ=.64).

10.2196/jmir.5473,Mining Health App Data to Find More and Less Successful Weight Loss Subgroups,"Background More than half of all smartphone app downloads involve weight, diet, and exercise. If successful, these lifestyle apps may have far-reaching effects for disease prevention and health cost-savings, but few researchers have analyzed data from these apps. Objective The purposes of this study were to analyze data from a commercial health app (Lose It!) in order to identify successful weight loss subgroups via exploratory analyses and to verify the stability of the results. Methods Cross-sectional, de-identified data from Lose It! were analyzed. This dataset (n=12,427,196) was randomly split into 24 subsamples, and this study used 3 subsamples (combined n=972,687). Classification and regression tree methods were used to explore groupings of weight loss with one subsample, with descriptive analyses to examine other group characteristics. Data mining validation methods were conducted with 2 additional subsamples. Results In subsample 1, 14.96% of users lost 5% or more of their starting body weight. Classification and regression tree analysis identified 3 distinct subgroups: “the occasional users” had the lowest proportion (4.87%) of individuals who successfully lost weight; “the basic users” had 37.61% weight loss success; and “the power users” achieved the highest percentage of weight loss success at 72.70%. Behavioral factors delineated the subgroups, though app-related behavioral characteristics further distinguished them. Results were replicated in further analyses with separate subsamples. Conclusions This study demonstrates that distinct subgroups can be identified in “messy” commercial app data and the identified subgroups can be replicated in independent samples. Behavioral factors and use of custom app features characterized the subgroups. Targeting and tailoring information to particular subgroups could enhance weight loss success. Future studies should replicate data mining analyses to increase methodology rigor.",2016,2016-06-01 00:00:00,55.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d66ae195b4011c9839d4578fa2ccb91d14e1a97b

Using this technology, scientists and physicians can observe the entire human genome comprehensively, generating a plethora of new sequencing data. Modern computational analysis entails advanced algorithms for variant detection, as well as complex models for classification. Data science and machine learning play a crucial role in the processing and interpretation of results, using enormous databases and statistics to discover new and support current genotype–phenotype correlations. In clinical practice, this technology has greatly enabled the development of personalized medicine, approaching each patient individually and in accordance with their genetic and biochemical profile. The most propulsive areas include rare disease genomics, oncogenomics, pharmacogenomics, neonatal screening, and infectious disease genomics. Another crucial application of WGS lies in the field of multi-omics, working towards the complete integration of human biomolecular data.

10.1007/s00018-023-05099-7,Wnt/β-catenin-driven EMT regulation in human cancers,"Metastasis accounts for 90% of cancer-related deaths among the patients. The transformation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells with molecular alterations can occur during epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT mechanism accelerates the cancer metastasis and drug resistance ability in human cancers. Among the different regulators of EMT, Wnt/β-catenin axis has been emerged as a versatile modulator. Wnt is in active form in physiological condition due to the function of GSK-3β that destructs β-catenin, while ligand–receptor interaction impairs GSK-3β function to increase β-catenin stability and promote its nuclear transfer. Regarding the oncogenic function of Wnt/β-catenin, its upregulation occurs in human cancers and it can accelerate EMT-mediated metastasis and drug resistance. The stimulation of Wnt by binding Wnt ligands into Frizzled receptors can enhance β-catenin accumulation in cytoplasm that stimulates EMT and related genes upon nuclear translocation. Wnt/β-catenin/EMT axis has been implicated in augmenting metastasis of both solid and hematological tumors. The Wnt/EMT-mediated cancer metastasis promotes the malignant behavior of tumor cells, causing therapy resistance. The Wnt/β-catenin/EMT axis can be modulated by upstream mediators in which non-coding RNAs are main regulators. Moreover, pharmacological intervention, mainly using phytochemicals, suppresses Wnt/EMT axis in metastasis suppression.

10.1007/s00521-020-04831-9,On defending against label flipping attacks on malware detection systems,"Label manipulation attacks are a subclass of data poisoning attacks in adversarial machine learning used against different applications, such as malware detection. These types of attacks represent a serious threat to detection systems in environments having high noise rate or uncertainty, such as complex networks and Internet of Thing (IoT). Recent work in the literature has suggested using the K-nearest neighboring algorithm to defend against such attacks. However, such an approach can suffer from low to miss-classification rate accuracy. In this paper, we design an architecture to tackle the Android malware detection problem in IoT systems. We develop an attack mechanism based on silhouette clustering method, modified for mobile Android platforms. We proposed two convolutional neural network-type deep learning algorithms against this Silhouette Clustering-based Label Flipping Attack. We show the effectiveness of these two defense algorithms—label-based semi-supervised defense and clustering-based semi-supervised defense—in correcting labels being attacked. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by varying the various machine learning parameters on three Android datasets: Drebin, Contagio, and Genome and three types of features: API, intent, and permission. Our evaluation shows that using random forest feature selection and varying ratios of features can result in an improvement of up to 19% accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art method in the literature.",2019,2019-08-13 00:00:00,86.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e410eb6a73db5601e7dfb1dd572b07222d224ad1

10.1038/s41522-023-00443-y,Mitochondrial dysfunction promotes microbial composition that negatively impacts on ulcerative colitis development and progression,"Recent evidence demonstrates potential links between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In addition, bidirectional interactions between the intestinal microbiota and host mitochondria may modulate intestinal inflammation. We observed previously that mice deficient in the mitochondrial protein MCJ (Methylation-controlled J protein) exhibit increased susceptibility to DSS colitis. However, it is unclear whether this phenotype is primarily driven by MCJ^−/− associated gut microbiota dysbiosis or by direct effects of MCJ-deficiency. Here, we demonstrate that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MCJ-deficient into germ-free mice was sufficient to confer increased susceptibility to colitis. Therefore, an FMT experiment by cohousing was designed to alter MCJ-deficient microbiota. The phenotype resulting from complex I deficiency was reverted by FMT. In addition, we determined the protein expression pathways impacted by MCJ deficiency, providing insight into the pathophysiology of IBD. Further, we used magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the intestinal microbiota with Immunoglobulin A (IgA-SEQ) in MCJ-deficient mice. We show that high IgA coating of fecal bacteria observed in MCJ-deficient mice play a potential role in disease progression. This study allowed us to identify potential microbial signatures in feces associated with complex I deficiency and disease progression.

Accumulating evidences have revealed the close relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation and progression of stomach cancer. However, rare prognostic models for mitochondrial-related gene risk have been built up in stomach cancer. Methods In current study, the expression and prognostic value of mitochondrial-related genes in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients were systematically analyzed to establish a mitochondrial-related risk model based on available TCGA and GEO databases. The tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell infiltration, tumor mutation burden, and drug sensitivity of gastric adenocarcinoma patients were also investigated using R language, GraphPad Prism 8 and online databases. Results We established a mitochondrial-related risk prognostic model including NOX4, ALDH3A2, FKBP10 and MAOA and validated its predictive power. This risk model indicated that the immune cell infiltration in high-risk group was significantly different from that in the low-risk group. Besides, the risk score was closely related to TME signature genes and immune checkpoint molecules, suggesting that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment might lead to poor prognosis in high-risk groups. Moreover, TIDE analysis demonstrated that combined analysis of risk score and immune score, or stromal score, or microsatellite status could more effectively predict the benefit of immunotherapy in STAD patients with different stratifications. Finally, rapamycin, PD-0325901 and dasatinib were found to be more effective for patients in the high-risk group, whereas AZD7762, CEP-701 and methotrexate were predicted to be more effective for patients in the low-risk group.

Mitochondrial processes were downregulated in inflamed and upregulated in non-inflamed UC mucosa, whereas angiogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were upregulated in both tissue states. Immune responses were upregulated in inflamed mucosa, whereas the non-inflamed UC mucosa presented both up- and downregulated gene sets. DE and enriched genes overlapped with genes present in inflammatory bowel disease genome-wide associated loci (p = 1.43 × 10−18), especially regarding immune responses, respiratory chain, angiogenesis, ER stress, and steroid hormone metabolism. Apart from confirming established pathophysiological mechanisms of immune cells, our study provides evidence for involvement of less described pathways (e.g., respiratory chain, ER stress, fatty-acid oxidation, steroid hormone metabolism and angiogenesis).",2022,2022-06-22 00:00:00,5.0,52.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c460ec125a983865795f107857d4e9b603c615b

Autoreactive CD4 T cell effector subsets (Th1,Th17) driving these diseases require increased glycolytic metabolism to upregulate key transcription factors (TF) like T-bet and RORγt that drive differentiation and proinflammatory responses. However, research in immunometabolism has demonstrated that mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules contributing to T cell fate and function. Eliminating autoreactive T cells by targeting glycolysis or ROS production is a potential strategy to inhibit autoreactive T cell activation without compromising systemic immune function. Additionally, increasing self-tolerance by promoting functional immunosuppressive CD4 T regulatory (Treg) cells is another alternative therapeutic for autoimmune disease. Tregs require increased ROS and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) for Foxp3 TF expression, differentiation, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine synthesis. Decreasing glycolytic activity or increasing glutathione and superoxide dismutase antioxidant activity can also be beneficial in inhibiting cytotoxic CD8 T cell effector responses. Current treatment options for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include global immunosuppression, antibodies to deplete immune cells, and anti-cytokine therapy. While effective in diminishing autoreactive T cells, they can also compromise other immune responses resulting in increased susceptibility to other diseases and complications. The impact of mitochondrial-derived ROS and immunometabolism reprogramming in autoreactive T cell differentiation could be a potential target for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Exploiting these pathways may delay autoimmune responses in T1D.",2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,83.0,171.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d0ab4407c2159d80f7cf42514462fbcd94ea302

We defined a somatization comorbidity phenotype (SCP) and examined its influence on response to certolizumab pegol (CZP) using data from the PREDICT trial.MethodsPatients in PREDICT were randomized to the patient-reported Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) or physician-based Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for treatment response assessment. Post-hoc analyses identified patients with the SCP, which included diagnosis of depression, fibromyalgia/myalgias, and/or use of medications indicated for treatment of depression, anxiety, or neuropathic pain. The effect of the SCP on RAPID3 or CDAI response at week 12 and low disease activity (LDA; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≤ 3.2) at week 52, in week-12 responders, was analyzed using non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).ResultsAt baseline, 43% (313/733) of patients met the SCP classification. Patients with the SCP were 9% more likely to withdraw from the trial. American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses were 5–14% lower among those with the SCP, and 11% more patients reported adverse events (AEs). Patients without SCP in the CDAI arm were twice as likely to achieve LDA at week 52 compared with those with SCP (32% versus 16%). No differentiation by SCP was observed in the RAPID3 arm (pooled result 21.5%).ConclusionsWe operationalized a potentially important somatization comorbidity phenotype in a trial setting that was associated with a substantially lower likelihood of treatment response and a higher frequency of AEs.

A National Population-Based Study of 162,283 Danish Adults","Objectives To identify patterns of multimorbidity in the general population and examine how these patterns are related to socio-demographic factors and health-related quality of life. Study design and setting We used latent class analysis to identify subgroups with statistically distinct and clinically meaningful disease patterns in a nationally representative sample of Danish adults (N = 162,283) aged 16+ years. The analysis was based on 15 chronic diseases. Results Seven classes with different disease patterns were identified: a class with no or only a single chronic condition (59% of the population) labeled “1) Relatively Healthy” and six classes with a very high prevalence of multimorbidity labeled; “2) Hypertension” (14%); “3) Musculoskeletal Disorders” (10%); “4) Headache-Mental Disorders” (7%); “5) Asthma-Allergy” (6%); “6) Complex Cardiometabolic Disorders” (3%); and “7) Complex Respiratory Disorders” (2%). Female gender was associated with an increased likelihood of belonging to any of the six multimorbidity classes except for class 2 (Hypertension). Low educational attainment predicted membership of all of the multimorbidity classes except for class 5 (Asthma-Allergy). Marked differences in health-related quality of life between the seven latent classes were found. Poor health-related quality of life was highly associated with membership of class 6 (Complex Cardiometabolic Disorders) and class 7 (Complex Respiratory Disorders). Despite different disease patterns, these two classes had nearly identical profiles in relation to health-related quality of life. Conclusion The results clearly support that diseases tend to compound and interact, which suggests that a differentiated public health and treatment approach towards multimorbidity is needed.",2017,2017-01-05 00:00:00,131.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0fdfc16b74deffec3a6061ffd5629a8a51b451ad

10.5194/NPG-21-971-2014,Representing model error in ensemble data assimilation,"Abstract. The paper investigates a method to represent model error in the ensemble data assimilation (EDA) system. The ECMWF operational EDA simulates the effect of both observations and model uncertainties. Observation errors are represented by perturbations with statistics characterized by the observation error covariance matrix whilst the model uncertainties are represented by stochastic perturbations added to the physical tendencies to simulate the effect of random errors in the physical parameterizations (ST-method). In this work an alternative method (XB-method) is proposed to simulate model uncertainties by adding perturbations to the model background field. In this way the error represented is not just restricted to model error in the usual sense but potentially extends to any form of background error. The perturbations have the same correlation as the background error covariance matrix and their magnitude is computed from comparing the high-resolution operational innovation variances with the ensemble variances when the ensemble is obtained by perturbing only the observations (OBS-method). The XB-method has been designed to represent the short range model error relevant for the data assimilation window. Spread diagnostic shows that the XB-method generates a larger spread than the ST-method that is operationally used at ECMWF, in particular in the extratropics. Three-dimensional normal-mode diagnostics indicate that XB-EDA spread projects more than the spread from the other EDAs onto the easterly inertia-gravity modes associated with equatorial Kelvin waves, tropical dynamics and, in general, model error sources. The background error statistics from the above described EDAs have been employed in the assimilation system. The assimilation system performance showed that the XB-method background error statistics increase the observation influence in the analysis process. The other EDA background error statistics, when inflated by a global factor, generate analyses with 30–50% smaller degree of freedom of signal. XB-EDA background error variances have not been inflated. The presented EDAs have been used to generate the initial perturbations of the ECMWF ensemble prediction system (EPS) of which the XB-EDA induces the largest EPS spread, also in the medium range, leading to a more reliable ensemble. Compared to ST-EDA, XB-EDA leads to a small improvement of the EPS ignorance skill score at day 3 and 7.",2014,2014-09-23 00:00:00,17.0,53.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a925b9603f4f2431cd7e4bbfd6e7909c79378fa

10.5194/ACP-14-5233-2014,A scale and aerosol aware stochastic convective parameterization for weather and air quality modeling,"Abstract. A convective parameterization is described and evaluated that may be used in high resolution non-hydrostatic mesoscale models as well as in modeling system with unstructured varying grid resolutions and for convection aware simulations. This scheme is based on a stochastic approach originally implemented by Grell and Devenyi (2002). Two approaches are tested on resolutions ranging from 20 km to 5 km. One approach is based on spreading subsidence to neighboring grid points, the other one on a recently introduced method by Arakawa et al. (2011). Results from model intercomparisons, as well as verification with observations indicate that both the spreading of the subsidence and Arakawa's approach work well for the highest resolution runs. Because of its simplicity and its capability for an automatic smooth transition as the resolution is increased, Arakawa's approach may be preferred. Additionally, interactions with aerosols have been implemented through a cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) dependent autoconversion of cloud water to rain as well as an aerosol dependent evaporation of cloud drops. Initial tests with this newly implemented aerosol approach show plausible results with a decrease in predicted precipitation in some areas, caused by the changed autoconversion mechanism. This change also causes a significant increase of cloud water and ice detrainment near the cloud tops. Some areas also experience an increase of precipitation, most likely caused by strengthened downdrafts.",2013,2013-09-11 00:00:00,963.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f06289c2c98ae250c258d2cf3fd199262a4e1848

10.3390/sym13040706,X-SDD: A New Benchmark for Hot Rolled Steel Strip Surface Defects Detection,"It is important to accurately classify the defects in hot rolled steel strip since the detection of defects in hot rolled steel strip is closely related to the quality of the final product. The lack of actual hot-rolled strip defect data sets currently limits further research on the classification of hot-rolled strip defects to some extent. In real production, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm has some difficulties, for example, the algorithm is not particularly accurate in classifying some uncommon defects. Therefore, further research is needed on how to apply deep learning to the actual detection of defects on the surface of hot rolled steel strip. In this paper, we proposed a hot rolled steel strip defect dataset called Xsteel surface defect dataset (X-SDD) which contains seven typical types of hot rolled strip defects with a total of 1360 defect images. Compared with the six defect types of the commonly used NEU surface defect database (NEU-CLS), our proposed X-SDD contains more types. Then, we adopt the newly proposed RepVGG algorithm and combine it with the spatial attention (SA) mechanism to verify the effect on the X-SDD. Finally, we apply multiple algorithms to test on our proposed X-SDD to provide the corresponding benchmarks. The test results show that our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 95.10% on the testset, which exceeds other comparable algorithms by a large margin.

10.3390/ma14081957,Wavelet Scattering and Neural Networks for Railhead Defect Identification,"Accurate and automatic railhead inspection is crucial for the operational safety of railway systems. Deep learning on visual images is effective in the automatic detection of railhead defects, but either intensive data requirements or ignoring defect sizes reduce its applicability. This paper developed a machine learning framework based on wavelet scattering networks (WSNs) and neural networks (NNs) for identifying railhead defects. WSNs are functionally equivalent to deep convolutional neural networks while containing no parameters, thus suitable for non-intensive datasets. NNs can restore location and size information. The publicly available rail surface discrete defects (RSDD) datasets were analyzed, including 67 Type-I railhead images acquired from express tracks and 128 Type-II images captured from ordinary/heavy haul tracks. The ultimate validation accuracy reached 99.80% and 99.44%, respectively. WSNs can extract implicit signal features, and the support vector machine classifier can improve the learning accuracy of NNs by over 6%. Three criteria, namely the precision, recall, and F-measure, were calculated for comparison with the literature. At the pixel level, the developed approach achieved three criteria of around 90%, outperforming former methods. At the defect level, the recall rates reached 100%, indicating all labeled defects were identified. The precision rates were around 75%, affected by the insignificant misidentified speckles (smaller than 20 pixels). Nonetheless, the developed learning framework was effective in identifying railhead defects.",2021,2021-04-01 00:00:00,10.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca41132c7a80c07ca516e236dc3bad527e5a9cb1
10.3390/MET11030388,Automatic Detection and Classification of Steel Surface Defect Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Automatic detection of steel surface defects is very important for product quality control in the steel industry. However, the traditional method cannot be well applied in the production line, because of its low accuracy and slow running speed. The current, popular algorithm (based on deep learning) also has the problem of low accuracy, and there is still a lot of room for improvement. This paper proposes a method combining improved ResNet50 and enhanced faster region convolutional neural networks (faster R-CNN) to reduce the average running time and improve the accuracy. Firstly, the image input into the improved ResNet50 model, which add the deformable revolution network (DCN) and improved cutout to classify the sample with defects and without defects. If the probability of having a defect is less than 0.3, the algorithm directly outputs the sample without defects. Otherwise, the samples are further input into the improved faster R-CNN, which adds spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), enhanced feature pyramid networks (FPN), and matrix NMS. The final output is the location and classification of the defect in the sample or without defect in the sample. By analyzing the data set obtained in the real factory environment, the accuracy of this method can reach 98.2%. At the same time, the average running time is faster than other models.",2021,2021-02-26 00:00:00,114.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f7c5252b1225008916c3c098bd1f17d6025333e

However, it is difficult to visually analyze ECG signals due to their complexity and nonlinearity. The wavelet scattering transform can generate translation-invariant and deformation-stable representations of ECG signals through cascades of wavelet convolutions with nonlinear modulus and averaging operators. We proposed a novel approach using wavelet scattering transform to automatically classify four categories of arrhythmia ECG heartbeats, namely, nonectopic (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V), and fusion (F) beats. In this study, the wavelet scattering transform extracted 8 time windows from each ECG heartbeat. Two dimensionality reduction methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and time window selection, were applied on the 8 time windows. These processed features were fed to the neural network (NN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifiers for classification. The 4th time window in combination with KNN (k = 4) has achieved the optimal performance with an averaged accuracy, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.3%, 99.6%, 99.5%, and 98.8%, respectively, using tenfold cross-validation.

These variables make just tiny changes to the real-world model but have a significant impact on the classification result. To overcome these problems, we propose an evolutionary classifier with a Bayes kernel (BYEC) that can be adjusted with a small sample set to better adapt the model for a new production line. First, abundant features were introduced to cover detailed information about the defects. Second, we constructed a series of support vector machines (SVMs) with a random subspace of the features. Then, a Bayes classifier was trained as an evolutionary kernel fused with the results from the sub-SVM to form an integrated classifier. Finally, we proposed a method to adjust the Bayes evolutionary kernel with a small sample set. We compared the performance of this method to various algorithms; experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be adjusted with a small sample set to fit the changed model. Experimental evaluations were conducted to demonstrate the robustness, low requirement for samples, and adaptiveness of the proposed method.",2017,2017-07-17 00:00:00,49.0,28.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ba029539da8acc5105ae2831c8533402f8509bd

This work aims to develop and pilot a methodology to help decision makers target and prioritize sampling investigations and identify contaminated natural resources. Here we use random forest models to predict ∑PFAS in fish tissue; understanding PFAS levels in fish is particularly important in the CRB because fish can be a major component of tribal and indigenous people diet. Geospatial data, including land cover and distances to known or potential PFAS sources and industries, were leveraged as predictors for modeling. Models were developed and evaluated for Washington state and Oregon using limited available empirical data. Mapped predictions show several areas where detectable concentrations of PFAS in fish tissue are predicted to occur, but prior sampling has not yet confirmed. Variable importance is analyzed to identify potentially important sources of PFAS in fish in this region. The cost-effective methodologies demonstrated here can help address sparsity of existing PFAS occurrence data in environmental media in this and other regions while also giving insights into potentially important drivers and sources of PFAS in fish.",2023,2023-09-05 00:00:00,10.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ffbf5c6c0583ee1f4954e2e90be1b37bd4813b5

Here, the authors assess gut microbiota in early PD, REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and first-degree relatives of RBD and show PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs in RBD and their first-degree relatives. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been suggested to play an important role in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we performed a cross-sectional study to profile gut microbiota across early PD, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), first-degree relatives of RBD (RBD-FDR), and healthy controls, which could reflect the gut-brain staging model of PD. We show gut microbiota compositions are significantly altered in early PD and RBD compared with control and RBD-FDR. Depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and enrichment of pro-inflammatory Collinsella have already emerged in RBD and RBD-FDR after controlling potential confounders including antidepressants, osmotic laxatives, and bowel movement frequency. Random forest modelling identifies 12 microbial markers that are effective to distinguish RBD from control. These findings suggest that PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs at the prodromal stages of PD when RBD develops and starts to emerge in the younger RBD-FDR subjects.

Currently, we only have a limited understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of soil microorganisms, restricting our ability to assess long-term effects of climate and land-cover change on microbial roles in soil biogeochemistry. This study assesses the temporal trends in soil microbial biomass carbon and identifies the main drivers of biomass change regionally and globally to detect the areas sensitive to these environmental factors. Here, we combined a global soil microbial biomass carbon data set, random forest modelling, and environmental layers to predict spatial-temporal dynamics of microbial biomass carbon stocks from 1992 to 2013. Soil microbial biomass carbon stocks decreased globally by 3.4 ± 3.0% (mean ± 95% CI) between 1992 and 2013 for the predictable regions, equivalent to 149 Mt being lost over the period, or ~1‰ of soil C. Northern areas with high soil microbial carbon stocks experienced the strongest decrease, mostly driven by increasing temperatures. In contrast, land-cover change was a weaker global driver of change in microbial carbon, but had, in some cases, important regional effects. Soil microbial carbon is central to soil functions and services, but its spatial-temporal dynamics are unclear.

The annual revenue generated by fraud exceeds $1 trillion. Even while fraud is dangerous for organizations, it may be uncovered with the help of intelligent solutions such as rules engines and machine learning. In this research, we introduce a unique hybrid technique for identifying financial payment fraud by combining nature-inspired-based Hyperparameter tuning with several supervised classifier models, as implemented in a modified version of the XGBoost Algorithm. At the outset, we split out a sample of the full financial payment dataset to use as a test set. We use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. Records that are known to be illegitimate or fraudulent are predicted, while those that raise suspicion are further investigated using a number of machine learning algorithms. The models are trained and validated using the 10-fold cross-validation technique.

The inclusion of such attributes makes analysis harder, due to results with poorer generalization and higher resource usage. A common practice is, therefore, to ignore such attributes, removing them, albeit wasting the information they provided. Contrariwise, this paper reports our findings on the positive impacts of using high-cardinality attributes on credit card fraud detection. Thus, we present a new algorithm for domain reduction that preserves the fraud-detection capabilities. Experiments applying a deep feedforward neural network on real datasets from a major Brazilian financial institution have shown that, when measured by the F-1 metric, the inclusion of such attributes does improve fraud-detection quality. As a main contribution, this proposed algorithm was able to reduce attribute cardinality, improving the training times of a model while preserving its predictive capabilities.",2022,2022-10-15 00:00:00,6.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4b3d74379a7c3cfa39f294785cdb496542d2fb2

One of the crucial issues with using credit cards is fraud, which is a serious challenge in the realm of online transactions. Consequently, there is a huge need to develop the best approach possible to using machine learning in order to prevent almost all fraudulent credit card transactions. This paper studies a total of 66 machine learning models based on two stages of evaluation. A real-world credit card fraud detection dataset of European cardholders is used in each model along with stratified K-fold cross-validation. In the first stage, nine machine learning algorithms are tested to detect fraudulent transactions. The best three algorithms are nominated to be used again in the second stage, with 19 resampling techniques used with each one of the best three algorithms. Out of 330 evaluation metric values that took nearly one month to obtain, the All K-Nearest Neighbors (AllKNN) undersampling technique along with CatBoost (AllKNN-CatBoost) is considered to be the best proposed model. Accordingly, the AllKNN-CatBoost model is compared with related works.

For this end, it is obligatory for financial institutions to continuously improve their fraud detection systems to reduce huge losses. The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel system for credit card fraud detection based on sequential modeling of data, using attention mechanism and LSTM deep recurrent neural networks. The proposed model, compared to previous studies, considers the sequential nature of transactional data and allows the classifier to identify the most important transactions in the input sequence that predict at higher accuracy fraudulent transactions. Precisely, the robustness of our model is built by combining the strength of three sub-methods; the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for selecting the most useful predictive features, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for incorporating transaction sequences and the attention mechanism to enhance LSTM performances.

In this work, we study and evaluate recent advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) used for CCF detection systems, including fraud and non-fraud labels. Based on two resampling approaches, SMOTE and ADASYN are used to resample the imbalanced CCF dataset. ML algorithms are, then, applied to this balanced dataset to establish CCF detection systems. Next, DRL is employed to create detection systems based on the imbalanced CCF dataset. The diverse classification metrics are indicated to thoroughly evaluate the performance of these ML and DRL models. Through empirical experiments, we identify the reliable degree of ML models based on two resampling approaches and DRL models for CCF detection. When SMOTE and ADASYN are used to resampling original CCF datasets before training/test split, the ML models show very high outcomes of above 99% accuracy. However, when these techniques are employed to resample for only the training CCF datasets, these ML models show lower results, particularly in terms of logistic regression with 1.81% precision and 3.55% F1 score for using ADASYN.

10.3390/math9212683,Credit Card Fraud Detection with Autoencoder and Probabilistic Random Forest,"This paper proposes a method, called autoencoder with probabilistic random forest (AEPRF), for detecting credit card frauds. The proposed AE-PRF method first utilizes the autoencoder to extract features of low-dimensionality from credit card transaction data features of high-dimensionality. It then relies on the random forest, an ensemble learning mechanism using the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) concept, with probabilistic classification to classify data as fraudulent or normal. The credit card fraud detection (CCFD) dataset is applied to AE-PRF for performance evaluation and comparison. The CCFD dataset contains large numbers of credit card transactions of European cardholders; it is highly imbalanced since its normal transactions far outnumber fraudulent transactions. Data resampling schemes like the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), adaptive synthetic (ADASYN), and Tomek link (T-Link) are applied to the CCFD dataset to balance the numbers of normal and fraudulent transactions for improving AE-PRF performance. Experimental results show that the performance of AE-PRF does not vary much whether resampling schemes are applied to the dataset or not. This indicates that AE-PRF is naturally suitable for dealing with imbalanced datasets. When compared with related methods, AE-PRF has relatively excellent performance in terms of accuracy, the true positive rate, the true negative rate, the Matthews correlation coefficient, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.",2021,2021-10-22 00:00:00,47.0,42.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c163e6c887a24b28119492d6ed2c1223d63e9a9b

Idiopathic RBD occurs in the absence of any neurological disease or other possible cause, is male-predominant and its clinical course is generally chronic progressive. Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders.

10.1371/journal.pone.0194889,Statistical and Machine Learning forecasting methods: Concerns and ways forward,"Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.",2018,2018-03-27 00:00:00,1001.0,90.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6b3aeb29b5b4034d84598424b1edfb29acf2a6c

10.1371/journal.pone.0177544,Classification of breast cancer histology images using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. The diagnosis of biopsy tissue with hematoxylin and eosin stained images is non-trivial and specialists often disagree on the final diagnosis. Computer-aided Diagnosis systems contribute to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of this process. Conventional classification approaches rely on feature extraction methods designed for a specific problem based on field-knowledge. To overcome the many difficulties of the feature-based approaches, deep learning methods are becoming important alternatives. A method for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed. Images are classified in four classes, normal tissue, benign lesion, in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma, and in two classes, carcinoma and non-carcinoma. The architecture of the network is designed to retrieve information at different scales, including both nuclei and overall tissue organization. This design allows the extension of the proposed system to whole-slide histology images. The features extracted by the CNN are also used for training a Support Vector Machine classifier. Accuracies of 77.8% for four class and 83.3% for carcinoma/non-carcinoma are achieved. The sensitivity of our method for cancer cases is 95.6%.",2017,2017-06-01 00:00:00,810.0,32.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61244d24d769fb6c9626becd58204e766c059513

While most contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales. An E(3)-equivariant deep learning interatomic potential is introduced for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations.

10.3390/math11143198,A Maximally Split and Adaptive Relaxed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Regularized Extreme Learning Machines,"One of the significant features of extreme learning machines (ELMs) is their fast convergence. However, in the big data environment, the ELM based on the Moore–Penrose matrix inverse still suffers from excessive calculation loads. Leveraging the decomposability of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a convex model-fitting problem can be split into a set of sub-problems which can be executed in parallel. Using a maximally splitting technique and a relaxation technique, the sub-problems can be split into multiple univariate sub-problems. On this basis, we propose an adaptive parameter selection method that automatically tunes the key algorithm parameters during training. To confirm the effectiveness of this algorithm, experiments are conducted on eight classification datasets. We have verified the effectiveness of this algorithm in terms of the number of iterations, computation time, and acceleration ratios. The results show that the method proposed by this paper can greatly improve the speed of data processing while increasing the parallelism.",2023,2023-07-21 00:00:00,4.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa3eac354d4a22ae12451148e33e774bdb37aebc

Design Prospective feasibility study. Setting The study was conducted in a university setting and participants’ homes. Participants Thirty-five volunteers ≥55 years old were recruited. Intervention Participants were asked to follow a balance exercise programme 7 days a week for 3 weeks using a phone application. Seventeen participants trained for a further 3 weeks. Outcome measures Postural sway measures during quiet standing with feet at shoulder width apart and feet together, one leg standing and tandem stance were measured at baseline, and at the end of the 3 and 6 training weeks; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) assessed participants’ physical activity level before training; and app acceptability was recorded using a user experience questionnaire. Results Participants on the 3 and 6-week programme on average completed 20 (±5) and 38 (±11) days of training, respectively, and all scored moderate to high on the IPAQ. Between baseline and the 3-week assessments, statistically significant improvements were observed for anteroposterior sway, mediolateral sway, sway area during tandem stance, for anteroposterior sway during one leg standing and for sway area during feet together stance. Improvements were observed at 6 week compared with baseline but those between 3 and 6 weeks were not significant. Based on the questionnaire, participants reported that the app is an appropriate tool for balance training (77%), they reported benefits from the training (50%) and found it easy to fit it into daily routine (88%). Conclusion The high level of adherence and improvements observed in the analysed measures demonstrate the feasibility of using an app to train balance in moderately to highly physically active older participants.

10.1186/s12877-020-01880-6,Map the apps: a rapid review of digital approaches to support the engagement of older adults in strength and balance exercises,"Background Exercise interventions, particularly those targeting strength and balance, are effective in preventing falls in older people. Activity levels are generally below recommended levels and reduce with age. There is concern that exercise levels may be further reduced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital approaches may offer a means for older people to engage in strength and balance exercises independently in their own homes. The objective of this review was to identify and evaluate existing apps and websites to support independent engagement in strength and balance exercises by older people. Methods We conducted a rapid review of apps and websites, following PRISMA guidelines. We searched for available apps in the Android and iOS app stores, and performed a database search (MEDLINE and EMBASE) for apps in development. We searched for websites using the Google search engine. Apps and websites were evaluated in terms of existing evidence for effectiveness, use of behaviour change techniques (BCTs), and quality. Results We evaluated 13 apps and 24 websites on the basis of our selection criteria. Considering the evidence-base, quality and BCT scores, four apps and six websites are recommended for use by older people who wish to engage in exercise independently in their own homes. No apps or websites have been to RCT evaluation at the time of review. Conclusions Apps and websites have the potential to provide a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means for many older adults to engage in strength and balance training and reduce falls risk.",2020,2020-08-24 00:00:00,35.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b831c2b1bab7b35dd82c8d86fb31855e5b6b7232

10.1038/s41746-019-0204-z,"Digital assessment of falls risk, frailty, and mobility impairment using wearable sensors","Falls are among the most frequent and costly population health issues, costing $50bn each year in the US. In current clinical practice, falls (and associated fall risk) are often self-reported after the “first fall”, delaying primary prevention of falls and development of targeted fall prevention interventions. Current methods for assessing falls risk can be subjective, inaccurate, have low inter-rater reliability, and do not address factors contributing to falls (poor balance, gait speed, transfers, turning). 8521 participants (72.7 ± 12.0 years, 5392 female) from six countries were assessed using a digital falls risk assessment protocol. Data consisted of wearable sensor data captured during the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test along with self-reported questionnaire data on falls risk factors, applied to previously trained and validated classifier models. We found that 25.8% of patients reported a fall in the previous 12 months, of the 74.6% of participants that had not reported a fall, 21.5% were found to have a high predicted risk of falls. Overall 26.2% of patients were predicted to be at high risk of falls. 29.8% of participants were found to have slow walking speed, while 19.8% had high gait variability and 17.5% had problems with transfers. We report an observational study of results obtained from a novel digital fall risk assessment protocol. This protocol is intended to support the early identification of older adults at risk of falls and inform the creation of appropriate personalized interventions to prevent falls. A population-based approach to management of falls using objective measures of falls risk and mobility impairment, may help reduce unnecessary outpatient and emergency department utilization by improving risk prediction and stratification, driving more patients towards clinical and community-based falls prevention activities.",2019,2019-12-01 00:00:00,39.0,64.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/540673d35e9aca3bf218d3c5ed8fa2f25de4a867
10.1093/jamia/ocz175,Safety concerns with consumer-facing mobile health applications and their consequences: a scoping review,"Abstract Objective To summarize the research literature about safety concerns with consumer-facing health apps and their consequences. Materials and Methods We searched bibliographic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane libraries from January 2013 to May 2019 for articles about health apps. Descriptive information about safety concerns and consequences were extracted and classified into natural categories. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) statement. Results Of the 74 studies identified, the majority were reviews of a single or a group of similar apps (n = 66, 89%), nearly half related to disease management (n = 34, 46%). A total of 80 safety concerns were identified, 67 related to the quality of information presented including incorrect or incomplete information, variation in content, and incorrect or inappropriate response to consumer needs. The remaining 13 related to app functionality including gaps in features, lack of validation for user input, delayed processing, failure to respond to health dangers, and faulty alarms. Of the 52 reports of actual or potential consequences, 5 had potential for patient harm. We also identified 66 reports about gaps in app development, including the lack of expert involvement, poor evidence base, and poor validation.

10.3390/s19194075,Wearable Inertial Sensors to Assess Standing Balance: A Systematic Review,"Wearable sensors are de facto revolutionizing the assessment of standing balance. The aim of this work is to review the state-of-the-art literature that adopts this new posturographic paradigm, i.e., to analyse human postural sway through inertial sensors directly worn on the subject body. After a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus databases, two raters evaluated the quality of 73 full-text articles, selecting 47 high-quality contributions. A good inter-rater reliability was obtained (Cohen’s kappa = 0.79). This selection of papers was used to summarize the available knowledge on the types of sensors used and their positioning, the data acquisition protocols and the main applications in this field (e.g., “active aging”, biofeedback-based rehabilitation for fall prevention, and the management of Parkinson’s disease and other balance-related pathologies), as well as the most adopted outcome measures. A critical discussion on the validation of wearable systems against gold standards is also presented.",2019,2019-09-20 00:00:00,136.0,89.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/555ba7549d1c14b82a6f528c758d4a825f30a44c

While these messages can indicate differences in beliefs and behaviors between demographic groups, we do not have a clear understanding of how different demographic groups use platforms such as Twitter. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of how groups’ differing behaviors may confound analyses of the groups themselves. We analyzed one million Twitter users by first inferring demographic attributes, and then measuring several indicators of Twitter behavior.

10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2706674,Age Groups Classification in Social Network Using Deep Learning,"Social networks have a large amount of data available, but often, people do not provide some of their personal data, such as age, gender, and other demographics. Although the sentiment analysis uses such data to develop useful applications in people’s daily lives, there are still failures in this type of analysis, either by the restricted number of words contained in the word dictionaries or because they do not consider the most diverse parameters that can influence the sentiments in a sentence; thus, more reliable results can be obtained, if the users profile information and their writing characteristics are considered. This research suggests that one of the most relevant parameter contained in the user profile is the age group, showing that there are typical behaviors among users of the same age group, specifically, when these users write about the same topic. A detailed analysis with 7000 sentences was performed to determine which characteristics are relevant, such as, the use of punctuation, number of characters, media sharing, topics, among others; and which ones can be disregarded for the age groups classification. Different learning machine algorithms are tested for the classification of the teenager and adult age group, and the deep convolutional neural network had the best performance, reaching a precision of 0.95 in the validation tests. Furthermore, in order to validate the usefulness of the proposed model for classifying age groups, it is implemented into the enhanced sentiment metric (eSM). In the performance validation, subjective tests are performed and the eSM with the proposed model reached a root mean square error and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.25 and 0.94, respectively, outperforming the eSM metric, when the age group information is not available.",2017,2017-05-23 00:00:00,93.0,69.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04d67280aadec8c60506e93e7d0aeef831d9e928

As a result, it is crucial for companies to implement robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive data from intrusion, which can lead to significant financial losses. Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) require further enhancements to reduce false positives as well as enhance overall accuracy. To minimize security risks, data analytics and machine learning can be utilized to create data-driven recommendations and decisions based on the input data. This study focuses on developing machine learning models that can identify cyber-attacks and enhance IDS system performance. This paper employed logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest algorithms on the UNSW-NB15 network traffic dataset, utilizing in-depth exploratory data analysis, and feature selection using correlation analysis and random sampling to compare model accuracy and effectiveness. The performance and confusion matrix results indicate that the Random Forest model is the best option for identifying cyber-attacks, with a remarkable F1 score of 97.80%, accuracy of 98.63%, and low false alarm rate of 1.36%, and thus should be considered to improve IDS system security.",2024,2024-02-01 00:00:00,18.0,28.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2cbb3a46fdd965ad41aeee97896183c5a6210708

A codebook of 198 variables related to different aspects of pre‐attack behavior is applied to a sample of 55 lone actor terrorists. Data were drawn from open‐source materials and complemented where possible with primary sources. Most lone actors are not highly lethal or surreptitious attackers. They are generally poor at maintaining operational security, leak their motivations and capabilities in numerous ways, and generally do so months and even years before an attack. Moreover, the “loneness” thought to define this type of terrorism is generally absent; most lone actors uphold social ties that are crucial to their adoption and maintenance of the motivation and capability to commit terrorist violence.

10.1101/2023.03.25.534208,Autism is Associated with in vivo Changes in Gray Matter Neurite Architecture,"Postmortem investigations in autism have identified anomalies in neural cytoarchitecture across limbic, cerebellar, and neocortical networks. These anomalies include narrow cell mini-columns and variable neuron density. However, difficulty obtaining sufficient post-mortem samples has often prevented investigations from converging on reproducible measures. Recent advances in processing magnetic resonance diffusion weighted images (DWI) make in vivo characterization of neuronal cytoarchitecture a potential alternative to post-mortem studies. Using extensive DWI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmentsm (ABCD®) study 142 individuals with an Autism diagnosis were compared with 8971 controls using a restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) framework that characterized total neurite density (TND), its component restricted normalized directional diffusion (RND), and restricted normalized isotropic diffusion (RNI). A significant decrease in TND was observed in Autism in the right cerebellar cortex (β=-0.005, SE =0.0015, p=0.0267), with significant decreases in RNI and significant increases in RND found diffusely throughout posterior and anterior aspects of the brain, respectively. Furthermore, these regions remained significant in post-hoc analysis when the ASD sample was compared against a subset of 1404 individuals with other psychiatric conditions (pulled from the original 8971). These findings highlight the importance of characterizing neuron cytoarchitecture in Autism and the significance of their incorporation as physiological covariates in future studies. Lay abstract Children with autism have differences in neuron structure unique from the general population and populations with attention, anxiety, and depression disorders. Brain imaging data on over 11,000 children was acquired at ages 9 and 11 years-of-age. Estimates of neuron density were derived from brain imaging data using recently validated techniques and comparative groups were composed using parent reported diagnosis of autism and other common psychiatric disorders. Consistent macro-structural changes in brain have been difficult to replicate and micro-structural changes have been historically difficult to acquire with other methodologies. We identified regional differences in the density of neuron cell bodies, neuron branching, and total neuron density in those with a reported diagnosis of ASD. Findings were consistent when compared against those with other psychiatric disorders in post-hoc analysis. These findings demonstrate the viability and importance of investigating in vivo changes to neurons in those with autism to advance our current understanding of related physiology.",2023,2023-03-26 00:00:00,3.0,86.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8915cc5701ac4bd4877be0c3797ae4057567027d

Quantitative measurement of T1 and T2 relaxation, and diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) yield metrics related to the pathology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that occurs across the spectrum of MS. Objective: To use relaxation and DBSI MRI metrics to describe measures of neuroinflammation, myelin and axons in different MS subtypes. Methods: 103 participants (20 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 33 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 30 secondary progressive MS and 20 primary progressive MS) underwent quantitative T1, T2, DBSI and conventional 3T MRI. Whole brain, normal-appearing white matter, lesion and corpus callosum MRI metrics were compared across MS subtypes. Results: A gradation of MRI metric values was seen from CIS to RRMS to progressive MS. RRMS demonstrated large oedema-related differences, while progressive MS had the most extensive abnormalities in myelin and axonal measures. Conclusion: Relaxation and DBSI-derived MRI measures show differences between MS subtypes related to the severity and composition of underlying tissue damage. RRMS showed oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS. Progressive MS had even more evidence of increased oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS and RRMS.",2021,2021-06-16 00:00:00,15.0,42.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7cc7663d51750826fc70921aa2a284f9e98aedb

10.1136/tsaco-2020-000453,Validity of mild TBI risk score to predict intracranial hemorrhage in cases of mild traumatic brain injury in Thailand,"Background Patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) will receive a brain CT scan based on risk of injury. A previous study established a scoring system for patients with mild TBI that assigned <3 points for the low-risk group, 3–6 points for the moderate-risk group, and ≥6 points for the high-risk group. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the external validity of mild TBI risk scores for predicting intracranial hemorrhage in patients with mild TBI who had been transferred to receive a brain CT scan at the 10 nationwide CT scan–capable facilities in Thailand. Methods The study was a retrospective cross-sectional review of patients with mild TBI who received a brain CT scan in 10 nationwide hospitals of Thailand. Risk factors were observed and points calculated for predicting mild TBI scores based on patient records. Injured patients were divided into two groups: CT scans indicating normal and abnormal brain images. After this, the accuracy of mild TBI score for predicting the presence of intracranial hemorrhage was investigated. Results The study included a total of 999 patients, comprising 461 (46.15%) patients with abnormal brain CT scans indicating intracranial hemorrhage and 538 (53.85%) indicating no intracranial hemorrhage. In the low-risk group (mild TBI risk score <3), moderate-risk group (mild TBI risk score 3–6), and high-risk group (mild TBI risk score >6), the likelihood ratio positive of brain CT scans were 0.41, 3.53, and 77.3, respectively. Discussion Mild TBI risk score may assist healthcare providers to select patients with mild TBI for brain CT scan referral, particularly in hospitals without CT scan facilities.

10.1155/2022/8598305,PAS: Performance-Aware Job Scheduling for Big Data Processing Systems,"Big data analytics has become increasingly vital in many modern enterprise applications such as user profiling and business process optimization. Today’s big data processing systems, such as Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Hive, treat big data applications as a batch of jobs for scheduling. Existing schedulers in production systems often maintain fair allocation without considering application performance and resource utilization simultaneously. It is challenging to perform job scheduling in big data systems to achieve both low turnaround time and high resource utilization due to the high complexity in data processing logics and the dynamic variation in workloads. In this article, we propose a performance-aware scheduler, referred to as PAS, which dynamically schedules big data jobs in Hadoop YARN and Spark and autonomously adjusts scheduling policies to improve application performance and resource utilization. Specifically, PAS schedules multiple concurrent jobs using different policies based on the predicted job completion time and employs a greedy approach and a one-step lookahead strategy to opportunistically maximize the average job performance while still maintaining a satisfactory level of resource utilization. We implement PAS in Hadoop YARN and evaluate its performance with HiBench, a well-known big data processing benchmark. Experimental results show that PAS reduces the average turnaround time by 25% and the makespan by 15% in comparison with four state-of-the-art schedulers.",2022,2022-04-12 00:00:00,6.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd131d2937b46e2790ff67241886e8be9efcce38

10.3390/computers9040086,Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning Techniques,"There are several areas in which organisations can adopt technologies that will support decision-making: artificial intelligence is one of the most innovative technologies that is widely used to assist organisations in business strategies, organisational aspects and people management. In recent years, attention has increasingly been paid to human resources (HR), since worker quality and skills represent a growth factor and a real competitive advantage for companies. After having been introduced to sales and marketing departments, artificial intelligence is also starting to guide employee-related decisions within HR management. The purpose is to support decisions that are based not on subjective aspects but on objective data analysis. The goal of this work is to analyse how objective factors influence employee attrition, in order to identify the main causes that contribute to a worker’s decision to leave a company, and to be able to predict whether a particular employee will leave the company. After the training, the obtained model for the prediction of employees’ attrition is tested on a real dataset provided by IBM analytics, which includes 35 features and about 1500 samples. Results are expressed in terms of classical metrics and the algorithm that produced the best results for the available dataset is the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. It reveals the best recall rate (0.54), since it measures the ability of a classifier to find all the positive instances and achieves an overall false negative rate equal to 4.5% of the total observations.",2020,2020-11-03 00:00:00,132.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a8cb4bf9fbeb3abf2daf5588b3f5bf5599dcea2

10.1155/2019/4140707,An Improved Random Forest Algorithm for Predicting Employee Turnover,"Employee turnover is considered a major problem for many organizations and enterprises. The problem is critical because it affects not only the sustainability of work but also the continuity of enterprise planning and culture. Therefore, human resource departments are paying greater attention to employee turnover seeking to improve their understanding of the underlying reasons and main factors. To address this need, this study aims to enhance the ability to forecast employee turnover and introduce a new method based on an improved random forest algorithm. The proposed weighted quadratic random forest algorithm is applied to employee turnover data with high-dimensional unbalanced characteristics. First, the random forest algorithm is used to order feature importance and reduce dimensions. Second, the selected features are used with the random forest algorithm and the F-measure values are calculated for each decision tree as weights to build the prediction model for employee turnover. In the area of employee turnover forecasting, compared with the random forest, C4.5, Logistic, BP, and other algorithms, the proposed algorithm shows significant improvement in terms of various performance indicators, specifically recall and F-measure. In the experiment using the employee dataset of a branch of a communications company in China, the key factors influencing employee turnover were identified as monthly income, overtime, age, distance from home, years at the company, and percent of salary increase. Among them, monthly income and overtime were the two most important factors. The study offers a new analytic method that can help human resource departments predict employee turnover more accurately and its experimental results provide further insights to reduce employee turnover intention.",2019,2019-04-17 00:00:00,99.0,19.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b22420ab9855ec3aa55b6f9e326c972dd2020907

10.1002/widm.1312,Causability and explainability of artificial intelligence in medicine,"Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black‐box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use‐case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system",2019,2019-04-02 00:00:00,1014.0,91.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e80e4b2f2a09bdbc20c63af5d85e6fc333746a0

The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder‐Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.

10.1155/2015/374391,A Machine Learning System for Routing Decision-Making in Urban Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks,"In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), network topology and communication links frequently change due to the high mobility of vehicles. Key challenges include how to shorten transmission delays and increase the stability of transmissions. When establishing routing paths, most research focuses on detecting traffic and selecting roads with higher vehicle densities in order to transmit packets, thus avoiding carry-and-forward scenarios and decreasing transmission delays; however, such approaches may not obtain accurate real-time traffic densities by periodically monitoring each road because vehicle densities change so rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel routing information system called the machine learning-assisted route selection (MARS) system to estimate necessary information for routing protocols. In MARS, road information is maintained in roadside units with the help of machine learning. We use machine learning to predict the moves of vehicles and then choose some suitable routing paths with better transmission capacity to transmit packets. Further, MARS can help to decide the forwarding direction between two RSUs according to the predicted location of the destination and the estimated transmission delays in both forwarding directions. Our proposed system can provide in-time routing information for VANETs and greatly enhance network performance.",2015,2015-03-01 00:00:00,50.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/074b4562974ca02e75806300aab3b99c86ef1fc3

This study was conducted to compare the differences of sleep disorders in vestibular migraine (VM) patients and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patients. Methods: VM patients, BPPV patients, and healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Pittsburgh sleep quality index and polysomnography monitoring were used as subjective and objective, respectively, evaluation methods to evaluate the sleep quality of participants in the latest month. Results: Fifty-seven BPPV patients, 48 VM patients, and 42 HCs were included in this study. There were 79.16% VM patients, 54.39% BPPV patients, and 14.28% HCs with sleep disorders. The difference in the incidence rate of sleep disorders was significant between VM patients and BPPV patients (p = 0.008) and significantly higher in both the VM group (p < 0.00001) and BPPV group (p = 0.00004) than in the HC groups (14.28%). Compared with BPPV patients, the VM patients had the significantly lower sleep efficiency (p < 0.001) and N3 (p < 0.001) and the significantly higher time of wake-up after sleep onset (p < 0.001), N1 (p < 0.001), and N2 (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the VM patients had significantly higher incidence rates of severe obstructive sleep apnea hypoventilation syndrome (p = 0.001) and periodic leg movement in sleep (p = 0.016).

To this end, we build base-ml, a comprehensive MVA/ML software tool, and applied it to three increasingly difficult clinical objectives in differentiation of common vestibular disorders, using data from a large prospective clinical patient registry (DizzyReg). Methods: Base-ml features a full MVA/ML pipeline for classification of multimodal patient data, comprising tools for data loading and pre-processing; a stringent scheme for nested and stratified cross-validation including hyper-parameter optimization; a set of 11 classifiers, ranging from commonly used algorithms like logistic regression and random forests, to artificial neural network models, including a graph-based deep learning model which we recently proposed; a multi-faceted evaluation of classification metrics; tools from the domain of “Explainable AI” that illustrate the input distribution and a statistical analysis of the most important features identified by multiple classifiers. Results: In the first clinical task, classification of the bilateral vestibular failure (N = 66) vs. functional dizziness (N = 346) was possible with a classification accuracy ranging up to 92.5% (Random Forest). In the second task, primary functional dizziness (N = 151) vs. secondary functional dizziness (following an organic vestibular syndrome) (N = 204), was classifiable with an accuracy ranging from 56.5 to 64.2% (k-nearest neighbors/logistic regression). The third task compared four episodic disorders, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (N = 134), vestibular paroxysmia (N = 49), Menière disease (N = 142) and vestibular migraine (N = 215). Classification accuracy ranged between 25.9 and 50.4% (Naïve Bayes/Support Vector Machine). Recent (graph-) deep learning models classified well in all three tasks, but not significantly better than more traditional ML methods. Classifiers reliably identified clinically relevant features as most important toward classification. Conclusion: The three clinical tasks yielded classification results that correlate with the clinical intuition regarding the difficulty of diagnosis. It is favorable to apply an array of MVA/ML algorithms rather than a single one, to avoid under-estimation of classification accuracy. Base-ml provides a systematic benchmarking of classifiers, with a standardized output of MVA/ML performance on clinical tasks. To alleviate re-implementation efforts, we provide base-ml as an open-source tool for the community.",2021,2021-08-02 00:00:00,8.0,70.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e761c938b3c437f756ea72d4e168fbb02d996a32

In the presence of complex diagnostic information, automated systems can support human decision making. Recent developments in machine learning might facilitate bedside diagnosis of VM and MD. Methods Data of this study originate from the prospective patient registry of the German Centre for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, a specialized tertiary treatment center at the University Hospital Munich. The classification task was to differentiate cases of VM, MD from other vestibular disease entities. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) were used for classification. Results A total of 1357 patients were included (mean age 52.9, SD 15.9, 54.7% female), 9.9% with MD and 15.6% with VM. DNN models yielded an accuracy of 98.4 ± 0.5%, a precision of 96.3 ± 3.9%, and a sensitivity of 85.4 ± 3.9% for VM, and an accuracy of 98.0 ± 1.0%, a precision of 90.4 ± 6.2% and a sensitivity of 89.9 ± 4.6% for MD. BDT yielded an accuracy of 84.5 ± 0.5%, precision of 51.8 ± 6.1%, sensitivity of 16.9 ± 1.7% for VM, and an accuracy of 93.3 ± 0.7%, precision 76.0 ± 6.7%, sensitivity 41.7 ± 2.9% for MD.

Intrinsic variability between cells, caused by manufacturing differences, occurs at all stages of life and increases with age. Researchers need to know the minimum number of cells they should test to give an accurate representation of population variability, since testing many cells is expensive. In this paper, empirical capacity versus time ageing models were fitted to various degradation datasets assuming that the model parameters could be drawn from a distribution describing a larger population. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we estimated the number of cells required to be tested. Depending on the complexity of the ageing model, models with 1, 2 or 3 parameters respectively required data from at least 9, 11 or 13 cells for a consistent fit. This implies that researchers will need to test at least these numbers of cells at each test point in their experiment to capture manufacturing variability.",2021,2021-07-04 00:00:00,21.0,45.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55213a9c5f4dbef56aea6c2c16033d4a1c148209

10.1136/injuryprev-2019-043534,"How does mode of travel affect risks posed to other road users? An analysis of English road fatality data, incorporating gender and road type","Background Most analysis of road injuries examines the risk experienced by people using different modes of transport, for instance, pedestrian fatalities per-head or per-km. A small but growing field analyses the impact that the use of different transport modes has on other road users, for instance, injuries to others per-km driven. Methods This paper moves the analysis of risk posed to others forward by comparing six different vehicular modes, separating road types (major vs minor roads in urban vs rural settings). The comparison of risk posed by men and women for all these modes is also novel. Results Per-vehicle kilometre, buses and lorries pose much the highest risk to others, while cycles pose the lowest. Motorcycles pose a substantially higher per-km risk to others than cars. The fatality risk posed by cars or vans to ORUs per km is higher in rural areas. Risk posed is generally higher on major roads, although not in the case of lorries, suggesting a link to higher speeds. Men pose higher per-km risk to others than women for all modes except buses, as well as being over-represented among users of the most dangerous vehicles. Conclusions Future research should examine more settings, adjust for spatial and temporal confounders, or examine how infrastructure or route characteristics affect risk posed to others. Although for most victims the other vehicle involved is a car, results suggest policy-makers should also seek to reduce disproportionate risks posed by the more dangerous vehicles, for instance, by discouraging motorcycling. Finally, given higher risk posed to others by men across five of six modes analysed, policy-makers should consider how to reduce persistent large gender imbalances in jobs involving driving.",2020,2020-03-30 00:00:00,20.0,19.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4161b85c3cf794a3562319e11dac607d02dc8c58

By analyzing the synergies between gender inequality (as a problem), and lack of sustainability (another problem), there is a potential to create an understanding of how these problems are linked. Our aim is to better understand how gendered norms find expression in transport policy and planning. Taking a starting point in gender studies we advance four ideal types on masculine and feminine norms and relate them to sustainability in transport. We advance a methodology for studying gender norms in relation to sustainability in terms of how they are expressed in the text. We contribute to a deeper understanding of transportation related to men and masculinity studies, and advance work by masculinity scholars to include sustainability in transportation issues. Through text analysis, we demonstrate empirically how four Swedish municipalities have developed their (sustainable) transport policies 2014–2018. Our results indicate that the level of sustainability, in plans and strategies, are related to the presence of diverse masculine and feminine norms rather than male and female bodies.",2020,2020-01-30 00:00:00,16.0,63.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a304bc7a507a8b64023d15031a30e6110185742b

10.1186/s13007-020-00596-3,"Plant, space and time - linked together in an integrative and scalable data management system for phenomic approaches in agronomic field trials","To ensure further genetic gain, genomic approaches in plant breeding rely on precise phenotypic data, describing plant structure, function and performance. A more precise characterization of the environment will allow a better dealing with genotype-by-environment-by-management interactions. Therefore, space and time dependencies of the crop production processes have to be considered. The use of novel sensor technologies has drastically increased the amount and diversity of phenotypic data from agronomic field trials. Existing data management systems either do not consider space and time, are not customizable to individual needs such as field trial handling, or have restricted availability. Hence, we propose an integrative data management and information system (DMIS) for handling of traditional and novel sensor-based phenotypic, environmental and management data. The DMIS must be customizable, applicable and scalable from individual users to organizations. Key element of the system is a dynamic PostgreSQL database with GIS-extension, capable of importing, storing and managing all types of data including images. The database references every structural database object and measurement in a threefold approach with semantic, spatial and temporal reference. Timestamps and geo-coordinates allow automated linking of all data. Traits can be precisely defined individually or uploaded as predefined lists. Filtering and selection routines allow compilation of all data for visualization via tables, charts or maps and for export and external statistical analysis. New possibilities of environmental information-based planning of field trials, weather-guided phenotyping and data analysis for outlier or hot-spot detection are demonstrated. The DMIS supports users in handling experimental field trials with crop plants and modern phenotyping methods. It focuses on linking all space and time dependent processes of plant production. Weather, soil and management, as well as growth and yield formation of the plants can be depicted, thus allowing a more precise interpretation of the results in relation to environment and management. Breeders, extension specialists, official testing agencies and agricultural scientists are assisted in all steps of a typical workflow with planning, designing, conducting, controlling and analyzing field trials to generate new information for decision support in the crop improvement process.",2020,2020-04-21 00:00:00,7.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db9beadbc7e744efe6af5635cab8748a2693163b
10.1101/709147,RootNav 2.0: Deep learning for automatic navigation of complex plant root architectures,"We present a new image analysis approach that provides fully-automatic extraction of complex root system architectures from a range of plant species in varied imaging setups. Driven by modern deep-learning approaches, RootNav 2.0 replaces previously manual and semi-automatic feature extraction with an extremely deep multi-task Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The network has been designed to explicitly combine local pixel information with global scene information in order to accurately segment small root features across high-resolution images. In addition, the network simultaneously locates seeds, and first and second order root tips to drive a search algorithm seeking optimal paths throughout the image, extracting accurate architectures without user interaction. The proposed method is evaluated on images of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from a seedling assay. The results are compared with semi-automatic analysis via the original RootNav tool, demonstrating comparable accuracy, with a 10-fold increase in speed. We then demonstrate the ability of the network to adapt to different plant species via transfer learning, offering similar accuracy when transferred to an Arabidopsis thaliana plate assay. We transfer for a final time to images of Brassica napus from a hydroponic assay, and still demonstrate good accuracy despite many fewer training images.

Phenotyping roots in soil is often challenging due to the roots being difficult to access and the use of time consuming manual methods. Rhizotrons allow visual inspection of root growth through transparent surfaces. Agronomists currently manually label photographs of roots obtained from rhizotrons using a line-intersect method to obtain root length density and rooting depth measurements which are essential for their experiments. We investigate the effectiveness of an automated image segmentation method based on the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to enable such measurements. We design a data-set of 50 annotated chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) root images which we use to train, validate and test the system and compare against a baseline built using the Frangi vesselness filter. We obtain metrics using manual annotations and line-intersect counts. Our results on the held out data show our proposed automated segmentation system to be a viable solution for detecting and quantifying roots.

This on-farm study was conducted with Minirhizotron techniques to identify dynamic root morphological traits and distribution (0–30 cm) under different nitrogen treatments. Five elite super hybrid rice cultivars, Liangyoupeijiu (LYPJ), Yliangyou 1(YLY1), Yliangyou 2(YLY2), Yliangyou 900(YLY900) and Super 1000(S1000), were grown at four N levels: 0 kg ha−1 (N1), 210 kg ha−1 (N2), 300 kg ha−1 (N3) and 390 kg ha−1 (N4) in 2015 and 2016. Results showed these cultivars had greater root traits and higher grain yield under N3. Total root number (TRN) and total root length (TRL) of these cultivars reached maximum at 55 days after transplanting (DAT). The new released cultivars YLY900 and S1000 were featured with an improved root system among these cultivars. The percentage of root number on 10–20 cm soil was over 50% compared with other soil layer. A significant positive correlation was found between grain yield and both TRN and TRL at 10–20 cm soil layer (P < 0.01). Given this situation, the grain yield of super rice cultivars could be further improved by increasing the proportion of roots at 10–20 cm soil layer under suitable nitrogen management.",2018,2018-01-09 00:00:00,45.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/890cd9e0b7f4a791dd441d4f6f6e1fbe1a1f8aeb
10.3390/a17040150,Solar Irradiance Forecasting with Natural Language Processing of Cloud Observations and Interpretation of Results with Modified Shapley Additive Explanations,"Forecasting the generation of solar power plants (SPPs) requires taking into account meteorological parameters that influence the difference between the solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere calculated with high accuracy and the solar irradiance at the tilted plane of the solar panel on the Earth’s surface. One of the key factors is cloudiness, which can be presented not only as a percentage of the sky area covered by clouds but also many additional parameters, such as the type of clouds, the distribution of clouds across atmospheric layers, and their height. The use of machine learning algorithms to forecast the generation of solar power plants requires retrospective data over a long period and formalising the features; however, retrospective data with detailed information about cloudiness are normally recorded in the natural language format. This paper proposes an algorithm for processing such records to convert them into a binary feature vector. Experiments conducted on data from a real solar power plant showed that this algorithm increases the accuracy of short-term solar irradiance forecasts by 5–15%, depending on the quality metric used. At the same time, adding features makes the model less transparent to the user, which is a significant drawback from the point of view of explainable artificial intelligence. Therefore, the paper uses an additive explanation algorithm based on the Shapley vector to interpret the model’s output. It is shown that this approach allows the machine learning model to explain why it generates a particular forecast, which will provide a greater level of trust in intelligent information systems in the power industry.",2024,2024-04-02 00:00:00,6.0,31.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b814128527051f29a7b6108ff4f82f6fec762cf

Therefore, it is necessary to develop and improve methods for forecasting of the power plants generation using the energy of the sun, wind and water flows. One of the ways to improve the accuracy of forecast models is a deep analysis of meteorological conditions as the main factor affecting the power generation. In this paper, a method for adapting of forecast models to the meteorological conditions of photovoltaic stations operation based on machine learning algorithms was proposed and studied. In this case, unsupervised learning is first performed using the k-means method to form clusters. For this, it is also proposed to use studied the feature space dimensionality reduction algorithm to visualize and estimate the clustering accuracy. Then, for each cluster, its own machine learning model was trained for generation forecasting and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm was built to attribute the current conditions at the model operation stage to one of the formed clusters. The study was conducted on hourly meteorological data for the period from 1985 to 2021. A feature of the approach is the clustering of weather conditions on hourly rather than daily intervals. As a result, the mean absolute percentage error of forecasting is reduced significantly, depending on the prediction model used. For the best case, the error in forecasting of a photovoltaic plant generation an hour ahead was 9 %.",2023,2023-08-08 00:00:00,9.0,26.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66b404da17d795583f0caf1d435b0bfd37470abf

One such requirement is the installed capacity utilization factor, which is extremely important for optimally placing power facilities based on renewable energy sources and for the successful development of renewable energy. Efficient placement maximizes the installed capacity utilization factor of a power facility, increasing energy efficiency and the payback period. The installed capacity utilization factor depends on the assumed meteorological factors relating to geographical location and the technical characteristics of power generation. However, the installed capacity utilization factor cannot be accurately predicted, since it is necessary to know the volume of electricity produced by the power facility. A novel approach to the optimization of placement of renewable energy source power plants and their capacity factor forecasting was proposed in this article. This approach combines a machine learning forecasting algorithm (random forest regressor) with a metaheuristic optimization algorithm (grey wolf optimizer).

10.3390/math10060999,A Modified Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm for an Intrusion Detection System,"Cyber-attacks and unauthorized application usage have increased due to the extensive use of Internet services and applications over computer networks, posing a threat to the service’s availability and consumers’ privacy. A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect aberrant traffic behavior that firewalls cannot detect. In IDSs, dimension reduction using the feature selection strategy has been shown to be more efficient. By reducing the data dimension and eliminating irrelevant and noisy data, several bio-inspired algorithms have been employed to improve the performance of an IDS. This paper discusses a modified bio-inspired algorithm, which is the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), that enhances the efficacy of the IDS in detecting both normal and anomalous traffic in the network. The main improvements cover the smart initialization phase that combines the filter and wrapper approaches to ensure that the informative features will be included in early iterations. In addition, we adopted a high-speed classification method, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and used the modified GWO to tune the ELM’s parameters. The proposed technique was tested against various meta-heuristic algorithms using the UNSWNB-15 dataset. Because the generic attack is the most common attack type in the dataset, the primary goal of this paper was to detect generic attacks in network traffic. The proposed model outperformed other methods in minimizing the crossover error rate and false positive rate to less than 30%. Furthermore, it obtained the best results with 81%, 78%, and 84% for the accuracy, F1-score, and G-mean measures, respectively.",2022,2022-03-21 00:00:00,76.0,62.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c7dd2095d1d01e8628922704158e90b247df587

10.3390/sym12091458,An Efficient Intrusion Detection Method Based on LightGBM and Autoencoder,"Due to the insidious characteristics of network intrusion behaviors, developing an efficient intrusion detection system is still a big challenge, especially in the era of big data where the number of traffic and the dimension of each traffic feature are high. Because of the shortcomings of traditional common machine learning algorithms in network intrusion detection, such as insufficient accuracy, a network intrusion detection system based on LightGBM and autoencoder (AE) is proposed. The LightGBM-AE model proposed in this paper includes three steps: data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The LightGBM-AE model adopts the LightGBM algorithm for feature selection, and then uses an autoencoder for training and detection. When a set of data containing network intrusion behaviors are inputted into an autoencoder, there is a large reconstruction error between the original input data and the reconstructed data obtained by the autoencoder, which provides a basis for intrusion detection. According to the reconstruction error, an appropriate threshold is set to distinguish symmetrically between normal behavior and attack behavior. The experiment is carried out on the NSL-KDD dataset and implemented using Pytorch. In addition to autoencoder, variational autoencoder (VAE) and denoising autoencoder (DAE) are also used for intrusion detection and are compared with existing machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, GBDT, and XGBoost. The evaluation is carried out through classification evaluation indexes such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. The experimental results show that the method can efficiently separate the attack behavior from normal behavior according to the reconstruction error. Compared with other methods, the effectiveness and superiority of this method are verified.",2020,2020-09-04 00:00:00,47.0,31.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0df8a938848c989a6eb48b18c2546021b8299a3e
10.1155/2020/8890306,DL-IDS: Extracting Features Using CNN-LSTM Hybrid Network for Intrusion Detection System,"Many studies utilized machine learning schemes to improve network intrusion detection systems recently. Most of the research is based on manually extracted features, but this approach not only requires a lot of labor costs but also loses a lot of information in the original data, resulting in low judgment accuracy and cannot be deployed in actual situations. This paper develops a DL-IDS (deep learning-based intrusion detection system), which uses the hybrid network of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) to extract the spatial and temporal features of network traffic data and to provide a better intrusion detection system. To reduce the influence of an unbalanced number of samples of different attack types in model training samples on model performance, DL-IDS used a category weight optimization method to improve the robustness. Finally, DL-IDS is tested on CICIDS2017, a reliable intrusion detection dataset that covers all the common, updated intrusions and cyberattacks. In the multiclassification test, DL-IDS reached 98.67% in overall accuracy, and the accuracy of each attack type was above 99.50%.",2020,2020-08-28 00:00:00,152.0,31.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fdaf1361ab653aafa10e6d27d83620ec3b4c4ae8

10.1038/s41598-023-48230-1,A novel hybrid feature selection and ensemble-based machine learning approach for botnet detection,"In the age of sophisticated cyber threats, botnet detection remains a crucial yet complex security challenge. Existing detection systems are continually outmaneuvered by the relentless advancement of botnet strategies, necessitating a more dynamic and proactive approach. Our research introduces a ground-breaking solution to the persistent botnet problem through a strategic amalgamation of Hybrid Feature Selection methods—Categorical Analysis, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis—and a robust ensemble of machine learning techniques. We uniquely combine these feature selection tools to refine the input space, enhancing the detection capabilities of the ensemble learners. Extra Trees, as the ensemble technique of choice, exhibits exemplary performance, culminating in a near-perfect 99.99% accuracy rate in botnet classification across varied datasets. Our model not only surpasses previous benchmarks but also demonstrates exceptional adaptability to new botnet phenomena, ensuring persistent accuracy in a landscape of evolving threats. Detailed comparative analyses manifest our model's superiority, consistently achieving over 99% True Positive Rates and an unprecedented False Positive Rate close to 0.00%, thereby setting a new precedent for reliability in botnet detection. This research signifies a transformative step in cybersecurity, offering unprecedented precision and resilience against botnet infiltrations, and providing an indispensable blueprint for the development of next-generation security frameworks.",2023,2023-12-01 00:00:00,25.0,84.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eefcd8de7ceec6ae1b3fce66f4ea823826c2e607

10.1136/bmjhci-2022-100731,A natural language processing approach to categorise contributing factors from patient safety event reports,"Objectives The objective of this study was to explore the use of natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to categorise contributing factors from patient safety event (PSE). Contributing factors are elements in the healthcare process (eg, communication failures) that instigate an event or allow an event to occur. Contributing factors can be used to further investigate why safety events occurred. Methods We used 10 years of self-reported PSE reports from a multihospital healthcare system in the USA. Reports were first selected by event date. We calculated χ2 values for each ngram in the bag-of-words then selected N ngrams with the highest χ2 values. Then, PSE reports were filtered to only include the sentences containing the selected ngrams. Such sentences were called information-rich sentences. We compared two feature extraction techniques from free-text data: (1) baseline bag-of-words features and (2) features from information-rich sentences. Three machine learning algorithms were used to categorise five contributing factors representing sociotechnical errors: communication/hand-off failure, technology issue, policy/procedure issue, distractions/interruptions and lapse/slip. We trained 15 binary classifiers (five contributing factors * three machine learning models). The models’ performances were evaluated according to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), precision, recall, and F1-score. Results Applying the information-rich sentence selection algorithm boosted the contributing factor categorisation performance. Comparing the AUPRCs, the proposed NLP approach improved the categorisation performance of two and achieved comparable results with baseline in categorising three contributing factors. Conclusions Information-rich sentence selection can be incorporated to extract the sentences in free-text event narratives in which the contributing factor information is embedded.",2023,2023-05-01 00:00:00,7.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78413cd47d26820d3e41abcd5e39ef50933c4ee6

10.2196/43014,Extracting Medical Information From Free-Text and Unstructured Patient-Generated Health Data Using Natural Language Processing Methods: Feasibility Study With Real-world Data,"Background Patient-generated health data (PGHD) captured via smart devices or digital health technologies can reflect an individual health journey. PGHD enables tracking and monitoring of personal health conditions, symptoms, and medications out of the clinic, which is crucial for self-care and shared clinical decisions. In addition to self-reported measures and structured PGHD (eg, self-screening, sensor-based biometric data), free-text and unstructured PGHD (eg, patient care note, medical diary) can provide a broader view of a patient’s journey and health condition. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process and analyze unstructured data to create meaningful summaries and insights, showing promise to improve the utilization of PGHD. Objective Our aim is to understand and demonstrate the feasibility of an NLP pipeline to extract medication and symptom information from real-world patient and caregiver data. Methods We report a secondary data analysis, using a data set collected from 24 parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who were recruited via a nonrandom sampling approach. Participants used a voice-interactive app for 2 weeks, generating free-text patient notes (audio transcription or text entry). We built an NLP pipeline using a zero-shot approach (adaptive to low-resource settings). We used named entity recognition (NER) and medical ontologies (RXNorm and SNOMED CT [Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms]) to identify medication and symptoms. Sentence-level dependency parse trees and part-of-speech tags were used to extract additional entity information using the syntactic properties of a note. We assessed the data; evaluated the pipeline with the patient notes; and reported the precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results In total, 87 patient notes are included (audio transcriptions n=78 and text entries n=9) from 24 parents who have at least one CSHCN. The participants were between the ages of 26 and 59 years. The majority were White (n=22, 92%), had more than one child (n=16, 67%), lived in Ohio (n=22, 92%), had mid- or upper-mid household income (n=15, 62.5%), and had higher level education (n=24, 58%). Out of 87 notes, 30 were drug and medication related, and 46 were symptom related. We captured medication instances (medication, unit, quantity, and date) and symptoms satisfactorily (precision >0.65, recall >0.77, F1>0.72). These results indicate the potential when using NER and dependency parsing through an NLP pipeline on information extraction from unstructured PGHD. Conclusions The proposed NLP pipeline was found to be feasible for use with real-world unstructured PGHD to accomplish medication and symptom extraction. Unstructured PGHD can be leveraged to inform clinical decision-making, remote monitoring, and self-care including medical adherence and chronic disease management. With customizable information extraction methods using NER and medical ontologies, NLP models can feasibly extract a broad range of clinical information from unstructured PGHD in low-resource settings (eg, a limited number of patient notes or training data).",2022,2022-09-27 00:00:00,23.0,52.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0e262c94a0415fda724aa91d6f60c627ddd0519

10.1001/jamahealthforum.2021.2430,"Diagnostic Errors, Health Disparities, and Artificial Intelligence: A Combination for Health or Harm?","In health care, diagnostic errors remain a substantial source of morbidity, mortality, and costs. The National Academy of Medicine recognizes diagnostic errors, defined as “the failure to establish an accurate and timely explanation of a patient’s health problem(s) or to communicate that explanation to the patient,”1 as a major health care issue. Diagnostic errors include delayed diagnoses, wrong diagnoses, and missed diagnoses. Despite the personal and societal consequences of diagnostic errors, they are often unrecognized and unaddressed in patient safety and in health care quality metrics and guidelines. The association between diagnostic errors and health care disparities has received even less attention to date. Disparities in health care access and outcomes by race and ethnicity, sex, gender, geographic location, and socioeconomic status are well documented and persistent. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed and been associated with increasing these deep-seated disparities in health and health care in the US.2 Even before the pandemic, in 2011, US health care disparities were estimated to cost $309 billion annually.3 Few studies have examined the association between diagnostic errors and health care disparities. One study suggested the potential for misdiagnosis based on the results of genetic testing when using diagnostic tools that were developed with less diverse patient populations.4 Another study indicated that Black patients are more likely than White patients to be underdiagnosed with depression during their first primary care visit for mental health needs.5 Similarly, Black children are less likely to be diagnosed with otitis media compared with White children with similar presentations.6 This limited evidence for diagnostic disparities most likely reflects a dearth of research rather than an absence of disparities. Diagnostic errors and disparities, twin challenges in health care, can and should be addressed by implementing research and quality improvement initiatives, policy and payment reform, and technology and by educating clinicians about the importance of evidence-based use of diagnostic tools and the contributions of social determinants of health to disparities in care. The proliferation of big data and associated artificial intelligence (AI) methods provides yet another avenue to address these challenges. For example, computer decision support has been associated with reduced inequities in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis,7 likely by reducing implicit bias. The health care industry is emerging as a leader in the adoption of AI through sophisticated machine learning– assisted diagnostic tools. For clinical trials, AI has the potential to support every stage of the process, including finding a trial in which to enroll, addressing patient-centric enrollment issues, and assessing trial medication adherence with remote and digital monitoring. It is equally important to tap into the opportunities provided by big data and AI to detect and address diagnostic disparities in populations at risk for such disparities. In a recent study, machine learning was used to develop a new algorithm to measure the severity of knee osteoarthritis based on existing radiologic data.8 With use of the well-established standard Kellgren-Lawrence grading system to classify osteoarthritis, Black patients had more severe osteoarthritis than did White patients. However, adjustment for Kellgren-Lawrence grading scores did not reduce or eliminate racial differences in patient-reported knee pain. Applying an AI-driven algorithmic measure markedly improved the predictive performance of the measure and reduced the racial disparity in patient-reported pain.8 Unlike the standard severity measure, which was developed Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.",2021,2021-09-03 00:00:00,12.0,10.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7a598371778bf7c8362633e437a6bdf89ca447e8

To identify and prioritize research questions to advance the field of diagnostic safety in the next 5 years. Ninety-seven researchers and 42 stakeholders were involved in the identification of the research priorities. We used systematic prioritization methods based on the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) methodology. We first invited a large international group of expert researchers in various disciplines to submit research questions while considering five prioritization criteria: (1) usefulness, (2) answerability, (3) effectiveness, (4) potential for translation, and (5) maximal potential for effect on diagnostic safety. After consolidation, these questions were prioritized at an in-person expert meeting in April 2019. Top-ranked questions were subsequently reprioritized through scoring on the five prioritization criteria using an online questionnaire. We also invited non-research stakeholders to assign weights to the five criteria and then used these weights to adjust the final prioritization score for each question. Of the 207 invited researchers, 97 researchers responded and 78 submitted 333 research questions which were then consolidated. Expert meeting participants (n = 21) discussed questions in different breakout sessions and prioritized 50, which were subsequently reduced to the top 20 using the online questionnaire. The top 20 questions addressed mostly system factors (e.g., implementation and evaluation of information technologies), teamwork factors (e.g., role of nurses and other health professionals in the diagnostic process), and strategies to engage patients in the diagnostic process. Top research priorities for advancing diagnostic safety in the short-term include strengthening systems and teams and engaging patients to support diagnosis. High-priority areas identified using these systematic methods can inform an actionable research agenda for reducing preventable diagnostic harm.",2021,2021-02-09 00:00:00,19.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74ce9e7b01f8446936a09bb053b708d56b34bb5c

One potential limitation of LDCT screening is overdiagnosis of slow growing and indolent cancers. In this study, peritumoral and intratumoral radiomics was used to identify a vulnerable subset of lung patients associated with poor survival outcomes. Incident lung cancer patients from the NLST were split into training and test cohorts and an external cohort of non-screen detected adenocarcinomas was used for further validation. After removing redundant and non-reproducible radiomics features, backward elimination analyses identified a single model which was subjected to Classification and Regression Tree to stratify patients into three risk-groups based on two radiomics features (NGTDM Busyness and Statistical Root Mean Square [RMS]). The final model was validated in the test cohort and the cohort of non-screen detected adenocarcinomas. Using a radio-genomics dataset, Statistical RMS was significantly associated with FOXF2 gene by both correlation and two-group analyses. Our rigorous approach generated a novel radiomics model that identified a vulnerable high-risk group of early stage patients associated with poor outcomes.

Here we report the design of a series of inositol phosphate analogs as crystallization inhibitors, among which 4,6-di-O-(methoxy-diethyleneglycol)-myo-inositol-1,2,3,5-tetrakis(phosphate), (OEG2)2-IP4, displays increased in vitro activity, as well as more favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles than IP6 after subcutaneous injection. (OEG2)2-IP4 potently stabilizes calciprotein particle (CPP) growth, consistently demonstrates low micromolar activity in different in vitro models of VC (i.e., human serum, primary cell cultures, and tissue explants), and largely abolishes the development of VC in rodent models, while not causing toxicity related to serum calcium chelation. The data suggest a mechanism of action independent of the etiology of VC, whereby (OEG2)2-IP4 disrupts the nucleation and growth of pathological calcification. Cardiovascular calcification is a serious pathology for which effective pharmacological treatments are lacking.

In the 2019 update, WebGestalt supports 12 organisms, 342 gene identifiers and 155 175 functional categories, as well as user-uploaded functional databases. To address the growing and unique need for phosphoproteomics data interpretation, we have implemented phosphosite set analysis to identify important kinases from phosphoproteomics data. We have completely redesigned result visualizations and user interfaces to improve user-friendliness and to provide multiple types of interactive and publication-ready figures. To facilitate comprehension of the enrichment results, we have implemented two methods to reduce redundancy between enriched gene sets.

10.1371/journal.pone.0197061,Characterization of SNF472 pharmacokinetics and efficacy in uremic and non-uremic rats models of cardiovascular calcification,"End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D3-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D3-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.",2018,2018-05-09 00:00:00,41.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d095b4ebb3b7ac34a69b9509752d71aaf31fe40
10.1371/journal.pone.0185009,Transcriptional study of hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis in male rats: Inflammatory changes are mainly associated with crystal deposition,"Hyperoxaluria associated with renal deposition of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals causes renal injury and inflammation leading to number of diseases including chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is however, not been possible to separate the renal consequences of hyperoxaluria from that of CaOx crystal deposition. We decided to utilize ethylene glycol (EG) model where hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal deposition can be separated in time. To test our hypothesis, male rats were made hyperoxaluric by administering EG, rats were euthanized and kidneys were extracted on day 14, when occasional crystal is seen in the kidneys and day 28, when all animals have developed renal CaOx crystal deposits. Total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis and genome wide analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed to investigate differences between hyperoxaluria and crystal induced alterations in the kidneys. Immunohistochemical and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was also done for macromolecules with significant role in stone formation. All EG fed rats became hyperoxaluric by day 7, showed a few crystal deposits on day 14, and had heavy crystal deposition by day 28. There were significant changes in the expression of genes encoding for NADPH Oxidases; macromolecular crystallization modulators; genes involved in inflammasome activation; and osteogenic marker genes. Results demonstrate major differences between hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal induced changes in the kidneys. Injury and inflammation are mainly associated with crystal deposition indicating significant role played by crystal retention.",2017,2017-11-01 00:00:00,30.0,74.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fdc772fe5645bcd973505edf3239aa5763ffcc53

10.1186/s13040-017-0133-9,Feature analysis for classification of trace fluorescent labeled protein crystallization images,"Large number of features are extracted from protein crystallization trial images to improve the accuracy of classifiers for predicting the presence of crystals or phases of the crystallization process. The excessive number of features and computationally intensive image processing methods to extract these features make utilization of automated classification tools on stand-alone computing systems inconvenient due to the required time to complete the classification tasks. Combinations of image feature sets, feature reduction and classification techniques for crystallization images benefiting from trace fluorescence labeling are investigated. Features are categorized into intensity, graph, histogram, texture, shape adaptive, and region features (using binarized images generated by Otsu’s, green percentile, and morphological thresholding). The effects of normalization, feature reduction with principle components analysis (PCA), and feature selection using random forest classifier are also analyzed. The time required to extract feature categories is computed and an estimated time of extraction is provided for feature category combinations. We have conducted around 8624 experiments (different combinations of feature categories, binarization methods, feature reduction/selection, normalization, and crystal categories). The best experimental results are obtained using combinations of intensity features, region features using Otsu’s thresholding, region features using green percentile G90 thresholding, region features using green percentile G99 thresholding, graph features, and histogram features. Using this feature set combination, 96% accuracy (without misclassifying crystals as non-crystals) was achieved for the first level of classification to determine presence of crystals. Since missing a crystal is not desired, our algorithm is adjusted to achieve a high sensitivity rate. In the second level classification, 74.2% accuracy for (5-class) crystal sub-category classification. Best classification rates were achieved using random forest classifier. The feature extraction and classification could be completed in about 2 s per image on a stand-alone computing system, which is suitable for real time analysis. These results enable research groups to select features according to their hardware setups for real-time analysis.",2017,2017-04-27 00:00:00,25.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4601e86cb7f7d1c1fe77c0d9e54abc1b972f664c
10.1038/srep45740,Calcium oxalate crystals and oxalate induce an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the proximal tubular epithelial cells: Contribution to oxalate kidney injury,"TGF-β1 is the main mediator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Hyperoxaluria induces crystalluria, interstitial fibrosis, and progressive renal failure. This study analyzed whether hyperoxaluria is associated with TGF-β1 production and kidney fibrosis in mice and if oxalate or calcium oxalate (CaOx) could induce EMT in proximal tubule cells (HK2) and therefore contribute to the fibrotic process. Hyperoxaluria was induced by adding hydroxyproline and ethylene glycol to the mice’s drinking water for up to 60 days. Renal function and oxalate and urinary crystals were evaluated. Kidney collagen production and TGF-β1 expression were assessed. EMT was analyzed in vitro according to TGF-β1 production, phenotypic characterization, invasion, cell migration, gene and protein expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Hyperoxaluric mice showed a decrease in renal function and an increase in CaOx crystals and Ox urinary excretion. The deposition of collagen in the renal interstitium was observed. HK2 cells stimulated with Ox and CaOx exhibited a decreased expression of epithelial as well as increased expression mesenchymal markers; these cells presented mesenchymal phenotypic changes, migration, invasiveness capability and TGF-β1 production, characterizing EMT. Treatment with BMP-7 or its overexpression in HK2 cells was effective at preventing it. This mechanism may contribute to the fibrosis observed in hyperoxaluria.",2017,2017-04-07 00:00:00,50.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23a7dc013a10a99147a189e69516b9c9aa6b825f

Early detection of students at risk, along with preventive measures, can drastically improve their success. Lately, machine learning techniques have been extensively used for prediction purpose. While there is a plethora of success stories in the literature, these techniques are mainly accessible to “computer science”, or more precisely, “artificial intelligence” literate educators. Indeed, the effective and efficient application of data mining methods entail many decisions, ranging from how to define student’s success , through which student attributes to focus on , up to which machine learning method is more appropriate to the given problem .

These are benefited by the automation of many processes involved in usual students’ activities which handle massive volumes of data collected from software tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, analyzing and processing these data carefully can give us useful information about the students’ knowledge and the relationship between them and the academic tasks. This information is the source that feeds promising algorithms and methods able to predict students’ performance. In this study, almost 70 papers were analyzed to show different modern techniques widely applied for predicting students’ performance, together with the objectives they must reach in this field.

10.3390/SU11102833,Application of Machine Learning in Predicting Performance for Computer Engineering Students: A Case Study,"The present work proposes the application of machine learning techniques to predict the final grades (FGs) of students based on their historical performance of grades. The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university’s strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching–learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching–learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student’s performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students.",2019,2019-05-17 00:00:00,101.0,35.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c0d8c7b571530613aae37dc863b9ed34c13e95b

10.1371/journal.pgen.1007206,Deep sequencing of HBV pre-S region reveals high heterogeneity of HBV genotypes and associations of word pattern frequencies with HCC,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common problem in the world, especially in China. More than 60–80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases can be attributed to HBV infection in high HBV prevalent regions. Although traditional Sanger sequencing has been extensively used to investigate HBV sequences, NGS is becoming more commonly used. Further, it is unknown whether word pattern frequencies of HBV reads by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used to investigate HBV genotypes and predict HCC status. In this study, we used NGS to sequence the pre-S region of the HBV sequence of 94 HCC patients and 45 chronic HBV (CHB) infected individuals. Word pattern frequencies among the sequence data of all individuals were calculated and compared using the Manhattan distance. The individuals were grouped using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Word pattern frequencies were also used to build prediction models for HCC status using both K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). We showed the extremely high power of analyzing HBV sequences using word patterns. Our key findings include that the first principal coordinate of the PCoA analysis was highly associated with the fraction of genotype B (or C) sequences and the second principal coordinate was significantly associated with the probability of having HCC. Hierarchical clustering first groups the individuals according to their major genotypes followed by their HCC status. Using cross-validation, high area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) of around 0.88 for KNN and 0.92 for SVM were obtained. In the independent data set of 46 HCC patients and 31 CHB individuals, a good AUC score of 0.77 was obtained using SVM. It was further shown that 3000 reads for each individual can yield stable prediction results for SVM. Thus, another key finding is that word patterns can be used to predict HCC status with high accuracy. Therefore, our study shows clearly that word pattern frequencies of HBV sequences contain much information about the composition of different HBV genotypes and the HCC status of an individual.",2018,2018-02-01 00:00:00,14.0,55.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/faf9b16129a022d4db4380b2a4bda6064179b0f3

In order to assess the relative contribution of HBV and HCV to HCC worldwide, and identify changes over time, we conducted a systematic review of case series published up to the year 2014. Eligible studies had to report seroprevalence of both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (anti‐HCV), alone and in combination, for at least 20 adult HCC cases. Studies using a first‐generation enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay test for HCV were excluded. A total of 119,000 HCC cases in 260 studies were included from 50 countries. Most European and American countries show a preponderance of HCV over HBV and a substantial fraction of viral marker–negative cases. Asian and African countries generally show a predominance of HBV. The fraction of HCV‐positive HCC cases is substantial in Taiwan, Mongolia, Japan, and Pakistan as well as in Western‐Central Asia and Northern Africa. No eligible studies were available in Oceania, large parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. The United States, Brazil, and Germany show evidence of higher prevalence of HCV in HCC since the year 2000. Conversely, Japan and Italy show a decline in the proportion of HCV‐positive HCC. Conclusion: HBV and HCV are predominant causes of HCC in virtually all world areas, with a growing fraction of HCC cases in several countries attributable to HCV.

However, it cannot yet replace Sanger sequencing (SS) in diagnostics because of incomplete representation and coverage of exons leading to missing clinically relevant mutations. Targeted next‐generation sequencing (NGS), in which a selected fraction of genes is sequenced, may circumvent these shortcomings. We aimed to determine whether the sensitivity and specificity of targeted NGS is equal to those of SS. We constructed a targeted enrichment kit that includes 48 genes associated with hereditary cardiomyopathies. In total, 84 individuals with cardiomyopathies were sequenced using 151 bp paired‐end reads on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The reproducibility was tested by repeating the entire procedure for five patients. The coverage of ≥30 reads per nucleotide, our major quality criterion, was 99% and in total ∼21,000 variants were identified. Confirmation with SS was performed for 168 variants (155 substitutions, 13 indels). All were confirmed, including a deletion of 18 bp and an insertion of 6 bp. The reproducibility was nearly 100%.

The etiopathogenesis of this condition is idiopathic. There are different predisposing factors in the literature which are consistent with the presented case such as lack of anterior prominence of the disc, thinning of the posterior zone of the disc and perforation of the disc. Patient Concerns: We report an uncommon temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthropathy case of a 33-year-old female patient, who presented with long-standing TMJ pain associated with limited mouth opening. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with non-reducible PDD of TMJ bilaterally. Treatment: Open surgery of TMJ (Discopexy) was the choice of treatment to release and mobilise discs. Outcomes: A noticeable increase in mouth opening without pain in TMJ area was achieved immediately after surgery and remained stable during periodic follow-ups. Take-away Lessons: The importance of magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool for arthropathy, to determine the proper management is essential.

Sagittal MRI images of 2520 TMJs were collected from 861 men and 399 women (average age 37.33 ± 18.83 years). A deep learning algorithm with a convolutional neural network was developed. Data augmentation and the Adam optimizer were applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the deep-learning model. The prediction performances were compared between the models and human experts based on areas under the curve (AUCs). The fine-tuning model showed excellent prediction performance (AUC = 0.8775) and acceptable accuracy (approximately 77%). Comparing the AUC values of the from-scratch (0.8269) and freeze models (0.5858) showed lower performances of the other models compared to the fine-tuning model. In Grad-CAM visualizations, the fine-tuning scheme focused more on the TMJ disc when judging ADD, and the sparsity was higher than that of the from-scratch scheme (84.69% vs. 55.61%, p < 0.05). The three fine-tuned ensemble models using different data augmentation techniques showed a prediction accuracy of 83%. Moreover, the AUC values of ADD were higher when patients with TMD were divided by age (0.8549–0.9275) and sex (male: 0.8483, female: 0.9276). While the accuracy of the ensemble model was higher than that of human experts, the difference was not significant (p = 0.1987–0.0671). Learning from pre-trained weights allowed the fine-tuning model to outperform the from-scratch model. Another benefit of the fine-tuning model for diagnosing ADD of TMJ in Grad-CAM analysis was the deactivation of unwanted gradient values to provide clearer visualizations compared to the from-scratch model. The Grad-CAM visualizations also agreed with the model learned through important features in the joint disc area. The accuracy was further improved by an ensemble of three fine-tuning models using diversified data. The main benefits of this model were the higher specificity compared to human experts, which may be useful for preventing true negative cases, and the maintenance of its prediction accuracy across sexes and ages, suggesting a generalized prediction.",2022,2022-07-05 00:00:00,30.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96aadcb01b14cf0908627270089bc6a75dd91c97

These images were used to evaluate three deep learning-based semantic segmentation approaches: our proposed convolutional neural network encoder-decoder named 3DiscNet (Detection for Displaced articular DISC using convolutional neural NETwork), U-Net, and SegNet-Basic. Of the three algorithms, 3DiscNet and SegNet-Basic showed comparably good metrics (Dice coefficient, sensitivity, and positive predictive value). This study provides a proof-of-concept for a fully automated deep learning-based segmentation methodology for articular discs on magnetic resonance images, and obtained promising initial results, indicating that the method could potentially be used in clinical practice for the assessment of temporomandibular disorders.",2022,2022-01-07 00:00:00,25.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d81774fdfa51cec836fde558ebe1f3e064ed9d1

10.3390/fire6010013,Louvered Fin-and-Flat Tube Compact Heat Exchanger under Ultrasonic Excitation,"Utilizing ultrasonic excitation as an active method for studying the rate of heat transfer has gained considerable attention recently. The present study investigated the effects of ultrasonic excitation on the heat transfer rate in a fin-and-flat tube heat exchanger experimentally. The performance of the heat exchanger was investigated with and without the presence of ultrasonic excitation. A comprehensive parameter study was attempted, so several parameters, including ambient temperature, flow rate, air passing velocity, Reynolds number, and Nusselt number, were studied in a relatively wide range. An adequate uncertainty test, as well as a validation assessment, is provided to certify the credibility of the obtained results and the hired facility. The results revealed that reducing the flow rate, ambient temperature, and air passing velocity on the heat exchanger increased the ultrasonic excitation’s effects. The highest heat transfer enhancement in the present experiment was 70.11%, measured at the lowest air passing velocity and ambient temperature with a Reynolds number 2166. The data presented in this paper will be useful for the optimal design of ultrasonic vibrating fin-and-tube heat exchangers.",2022,2022-12-31 00:00:00,40.0,28.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/508dbb3f071fdd1a305dea3b6cf357762d0d71fd

10.36897/jme/162041,The Additive-Subtractive Process Chain - a Review,"In recent years, metal additive manufacturing developed intensively and became a relevant technology in industrial production of highly complex and function integrated parts. However, almost all additively manufactured parts must be post-processed in order to fulfil geometric tolerances, surface quality demands and the desired functional properties. Thus, additive manufacturing actually means the implementation of additive-subtractive process chains. Starting with the most relevant additive processes (powder-based PBF-LB, LMD-p and wire-based WAAM and LMD-w/WLAM), considering intermediate process steps (heat treatment and shot peening) and ending up with post-processing material removal processes (with defined and undefined cutting edges), this paper gives an overview of recent research findings with respect to a comprehensive scientific investigation of influences and interactions within the additive-subtractive process chain. This includes both the macroscopic geometric scale and the microscopic scale of the material structure. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives are derived and discussed.",2023,2023-03-15 00:00:00,10.0,216.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bbc19bdb2befdb62d7b3ad9fe81537aacf09481f
10.1007/s40964-021-00240-z,Influence of the particle size distribution of monomodal 316L powder on its flowability and processability in powder bed fusion,"Powder bed fusion (PBF) is the most commonly adopted additive manufacturing process for fabricating complex metal parts via the layer-wise melting of a powder bed using a laser beam. However, the qualification of PBF-manufactured parts remains challenging and expensive, thereby limiting the broader industrialization of the technology. Powder characteristics significantly influence part properties, and understanding the influencing factors contributes to effective quality standards for PBF. In this study, the influence of the particle size distribution (PSD) median and width on powder flowability and part properties is investigated. Seven gas-atomized SS316L powders with monomodal PSDs, a median particle size ranging from 10 μm to 60 μm, and a distribution width of 15 μm and 30 μm were analyzed and subsequently processed. The PBF-manufactured parts were analyzed in terms of density and melt pool dimensions. Although powder flowability was inversely related to the median particle size, it was unrelated to the distribution width. An inverse relationship between the median particle size and the part density was observed; however, no link was found to the distribution width. Likely, the melt pool depth and width fluctuation significantly influence the part density. The melt pool depth decreases and the width fluctuation increases with an increasing median particle size.",2021,2021-12-06 00:00:00,24.0,33.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/341dd826de61599451c16c8e6c46b01d68140018

10.1108/frep-06-2023-0022,"Comparing the Harrod-Domar, Solow and Ramsey growth models and their implications for economic policies","PurposeThe principal aim of this paper is to review three basic theoretical growth models, namely the Harrod-Domar model, the Solow model and the Ramsey model, and examine their implications for economic policies.Design/methodology/approachThe paper utilizes a positivist research framework that emphasizes the causal relationships between the variables in each of the three models. Mathematical methods are employed to formulate and examine the three models under study. Since the paper is theoretical, it does not use any empirical data although numerical illustrations are provided whenever they are appropriate.FindingsThe Harrod-Domar model explains why countries with high rates of saving may also enjoy high rate of economic growth. Both the Solow and Ramsey models can be used to explain the medium-income trap. The paper examines the impact of Covid shocks on the macroeconomy. While the growth rate can be recovered, it may not always possible to recover the output level.Research limitations/implicationsFor the Harrod-Domar model, the public spending decreases the private consumption at the period 1, but there is no change in the capital stock and hence the production in subsequent periods. For the Ramsey model with AK production function, both the private consumption and the outputs will be lowered. In both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function, if the debt is not high and the interest rate is sufficiently low, it is better to use public debt for production rather than for consumption. If the country borrows to recover the Total Factor Productivity after the Covid pandemic, both the Harrod-Domar and Ramsey models with Cobb-Douglas production function show that the rate of growth is higher for the year just after the pandemic but is the same as before the pandemic.Practical implicationsThe economy can recover the growth rate after a Covid shock, but the recovery process will generally take many periods.Social implicationsThis paper focuses on economic implications and does not aim to examine social implications of policy changes or Covid-type shock.Originality/valueThe paper provides a comparison of three basic growth models with respect to public spending, public debts and repayments and Covid-type shocks.",2023,2023-10-10 00:00:00,3.0,10.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2d8fe7e57ad46ac46fdd8fc873fe13523e308d5

One context is clustered survival data, where survival data are collected on clusters such as families or medical centers. Dependent survival data also arise when multiple survival times are recorded for each individual. Frailty models are one common approach to handle such data. In frailty models, the dependence is expressed in terms of a random effect, called the frailty. Frailty models have been used with both the Cox proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time model.

10.21037/JGO-2020-01,New insights in the pathology of peritoneal surface malignancy.,"Pathology is central to the management of peritoneal surface malignancy. This article highlights some recent advances that have had an impact on patient management or could do so in the near future. Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, particularly the epithelioid subtype, is amenable to radical therapy in selected cases, and factors such as ki67 proliferation index, expression of BAP1 and mutation in CDKN2A show promise as prognostic indicators. Our understanding of multicystic mesothelioma has improved in recent years; it is a true neoplasm for which surgery may be indicated. Serous carcinomas involving the peritoneum are now known to originate from tubal epithelium. They are of two distinct types, high grade and low grade, which are now recognized as different neoplasms with distinctive features, oncogenesis and behavior. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is an unusual condition that usually arises from an appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Recent consensus in the classification and nomenclature of these lesions is discussed, including the distinction between low grade and high grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (HAMN), and the diagnostic criteria for appendiceal adenocarcinoma. PMP is divided into four prognostic groups: acellular mucin, low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei, and high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei with signet ring cells. The pseudomyxoma microbiome is a promising area for clinical intervention but has been the subject of little research activity. Goblet cell adenocarcinoma (previously known as 'goblet cell carcinoid') is a distinctive type of appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Its behavior correlates with histologic features, but no general consensus for classification has been reached.",2021,2021-04-01 00:00:00,12.0,131.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/83a400c08f9fe568b9c6b96d6711e10e4c24c73b

10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00402-9,Leveraging augmentation techniques for tasks with unbalancedness within the financial domain: a two-level ensemble approach,"Modern financial markets produce massive datasets that need to be analysed using new modelling techniques like those from (deep) Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The common goal of these techniques is to forecast the behaviour of the market, which can be translated into various classification tasks, such as, for instance, predicting the likelihood of companies’ bankruptcy or in fraud detection systems. However, it is often the case that real-world financial data are unbalanced, meaning that the classes’ distribution is not equally represented in such datasets. This gives the main issue since any Machine Learning model is trained according to the majority class mainly, leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we explore different data augmentation techniques to deal with very unbalanced financial data. We consider a number of publicly available datasets, then apply state-of-the-art augmentation strategies to them, and finally evaluate the results for several Machine Learning models trained on the sampled data. The performance of the various approaches is evaluated according to their accuracy, micro, and macro F1 score, and finally by analyzing the precision and recall over the minority class. We show that a consistent and accurate improvement is achieved when data augmentation is employed. The obtained classification results look promising and indicate the efficiency of augmentation strategies on financial tasks. On the basis of these results, we present an approach focused on classification tasks within the financial domain that takes a dataset as input, identifies what kind of augmentation technique to use, and then applies an ensemble of all the augmentation techniques of the identified type to the input dataset along with an ensemble of different methods to tackle the underlying classification.",2023,2023-07-10 00:00:00,3.0,86.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce3b2833d98705280a13d4672215945e4e5b3909

We considered the covid pandemic a black swan event that had caused ambiguity. A significant factor that has increased the probability of bankruptcy in recent times has been the large-scale supply chain disruptions and crippling lockdowns. Firms are trying to get back to pre-Covid utilization of plant capacity or pivot their business models differently to seize newer opportunities amidst the crisis. We considered the change in operating expenditure (primarily decrease) as our proxy for uncertainty as firms were forced to cut down majorly on their operations and thus incurred lesser variable costs. In an economy showing inflationary trends, the operating expenses will generally increase. But we found that the operational costs had shown a dip in the case of many of the firms during FY 20–21, and we attributed it to Covid disruptions. Results show that Machine Learning Techniques are better than Logistic Regression in predicting the bankruptcy of firms and that the same predictive power of ascertaining bankruptcy improves when a proxy for uncertainty is added to the model.",2023,2023-05-10 00:00:00,6.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6ea8891c9d8654ce47d2da90e558aafd14d14dbb

In this research, we examine a data set of 2,163,147 financial statements of German companies that are triple classified, i.e., solvent, financially distressed, and bankrupt. By classifying text features in terms of granularity and linguistic level of analysis, we show results for the potentials and limitations of approaches developed in this way. This study gives a first approach to evaluate and classify the likelihood of success of text mining approaches for extracting features that enhance the training database of AI-based solutions and improve corporate failure prediction models developed in this way.

In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.",2020,2020-10-19 00:00:00,289.0,122.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9198d6ab8ad1c6f1527a7d4adf06809848bf23c7
10.1007/s10956-020-09858-0,Comparison of Machine Learning Performance Using Analytic and Holistic Coding Approaches Across Constructed Response Assessments Aligned to a Science Learning Progression,"We systematically compared two coding approaches to generate training datasets for machine learning (ML): (i) a holistic approach based on learning progression levels and (ii) a dichotomous, analytic approach of multiple concepts in student reasoning, deconstructed from holistic rubrics. We evaluated four constructed response assessment items for undergraduate physiology, each targeting five levels of a developing flux learning progression in an ion context. Human-coded datasets were used to train two ML models: (i) an 8-classification algorithm ensemble implemented in the Constructed Response Classifier (CRC), and (ii) a single classification algorithm implemented in LightSide Researcher’s Workbench. Human coding agreement on approximately 700 student responses per item was high for both approaches with Cohen’s kappas ranging from 0.75 to 0.87 on holistic scoring and from 0.78 to 0.89 on analytic composite scoring. ML model performance varied across items and rubric type. For two items, training sets from both coding approaches produced similarly accurate ML models, with differences in Cohen’s kappa between machine and human scores of 0.002 and 0.041. For the other items, ML models trained with analytic coded responses and used for a composite score, achieved better performance as compared to using holistic scores for training, with increases in Cohen’s kappa of 0.043 and 0.117. These items used a more complex scenario involving movement of two ions.

10.3390/rs14122830,Multi-Scenario Simulation of Production-Living-Ecological Space in the Poyang Lake Area Based on Remote Sensing and RF-Markov-FLUS Model,"With industrialization and urbanization, the competition among land production, living, and ecological (PLE) spaces has intensified. Particularly in ecological reserves, competition among various types of land use restricts the coordinated development of PLE space. To explore spatial sustainable development, this study starts from a PLE spatial perspective, based on Landsat long time series images. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) and landscape index analysis were selected to monitor the spatial and temporal land use and landscape pattern changes in the Poyang Lake region (PYL region) from 1989 to 2020. The RF-Markov-FLUS coupled model was used to simulate spatial changes in 2030 under four scenarios: production space priority (PSP), living space priority (LSP), ecological space priority (ESP), and an integrated development (ID). Finally, the goal-problem-principle was used to enhance PLE space. The results showed that: (1) production space and ecological spaces decreased in general from 1989 to 2020 by 3% and 7%, respectively; living space increased by 11%. (2) From 1989 to 2020, the overall landscape spread in the Poyang Lake (PYL) area decreased, connectivity decreased, fragmentation increased, landscape heterogeneity increased, and landscape geometry became more irregular. (3) Compared with the other three scenarios, the ID scenario maintained steady production space growth in 2030, the expansion rate of living space slowed, and the area of ecological space decreased the least. (4) Spatial pattern optimization should start with three aspects: the transformation of the agricultural industry, improving the efficiency of urban land use, and establishing communities of “mountains, water, forests, fields, lakes and grasses”. The results provide scientific planning and suggestions for the future ecological protection of Poyang Lake area with multiple scenarios and perspectives.",2022,2022-06-13 00:00:00,27.0,65.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07bb4f486511077425d10fd85dae42b5925144d3

There are numerous seasonal lakes in the Poyang Lake region, and these lakes create a complex and diverse wetland landscape and serve as the main activity area for migratory birds. Seasonal lakes have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes, but research on seasonal lakes is relatively limited. Based on long-term remote sensing images, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of seasonal lakes and their influencing factors and ecological effects. The conclusions were as follows: the average water area of seasonal lakes showed a unimodal change during the year, reaching a maximum in July and a minimum in January. The interannual water area fluctuated greatly, and the overall water area showed a small downward trend. In terms of spatial variation, the seasonal lakes were connected with the main lake in the wet season and separated from the main lake in the dry season. Among the natural factors, the influences of temperature, evaporation, and rainfall on the water area of the seasonal lakes were successively reduced. In addition, the incoming water from the Yangtze River had an important influence. Among the human factors, the traditional fishing method “enclosing sublakes in autumn” had the greatest impact on the water area in a specific period, followed by the indirect impact of the Three Gorges Project.",2021,2021-05-30 00:00:00,13.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1d94bf2d8b998ceae98291cdcd480552c80b994

This paper analyzes changes in cultivated land, the driving factors that cause them, and their tremendous impact on landscape pattern changes in the Dongting Lake Basin. For this purpose, we used mathematical statistics, buffer analysis, trend analysis, landscape pattern index, and logistic regression model to analyze the land use data of the study area from 1980 to 2018. The results show that the cultivated land showed a decreasing trend, with the total area decreased by 4.76% (or 716.13 km2) from 1980 to 2018, and the activity of mutual transformation with other land use types decreased. The spatial distribution pattern of cultivated land and landscape shows the change characteristics gradually from Dongting Lake to the surroundings. Among the driving factors of cultivated land changes, the influence of human activities was gradually increasing, while the natural factors were decreasing. The cultivated land landscape pattern index and the overall landscape pattern index have a significant positive correlation, showing relatively consistent change trend and spatial distribution characteristics. We believe that the decrease of cultivated land area has a certain relationship with the increase of landscape fragmentation in the Dongting Lake Basin.

To evaluate the evolution of habitat quality and its influencing factors in the area, we used Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to interpret the land-use status and used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to analyze the characteristics of changes in habitat quality in the Poyang Lake Eco-Economic Zone (PLEEZ) from 1988 to 2018. The results show that, from 1988 to 2018, land use in the PLEEZ underwent significant changes. The changes in land use led to a gradual increase in habitat degradation and a gradual decrease in habitat quality in the study area. Rapid urbanization notably decreased the habitat quality in the study area. However, at the same time, the ecological protection projects such as returning farmland to forests slowed the decline in habitat quality. Driven by these two factors, habitat quality in the PLEEZ gradually declined but the rate of its decline was suppressed. The findings of this study are of great significance for the coordinated development of social, economic, and ecological development in the PLEEZ and similar areas.",2020,2020-08-27 00:00:00,31.0,68.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43b2b36afe4d1144cb53a2d1e096c1e925b4ae48

However, the clinical relevance of glycosylation-related genes (GRGs) in uveal melanoma (UM) is yet to be fully understood. This study aimed to shed light on the impact of GRGs on UM prognosis. Methods To identify the most influential genes in UM, we employed the AUCell and WGCNA algorithms. The GRGs signature was established by integrating bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. UM patients were separated into two groups based on their risk scores, the GCNS_low and GCNS_high groups, and the differences in clinicopathological correlation, functional enrichment, immune response, mutational burden, and immunotherapy between the two groups were examined. The role of the critical gene AUP1 in UM was validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The GRGs signature was comprised of AUP1, HNMT, PARP8, ARC, ALG5, AKAP13, and ISG20. The GCNS was a significant prognostic factor for UM, and high GCNS correlated with poorer outcomes. Patients with high GCNS displayed heightened immune-related characteristics, such as immune cell infiltration and immune scores. In vitro experiments showed that the knockdown of AUP1 led to a drastic reduction in the viability, proliferation, and invasion capability of UM cells. Conclusion Our gene signature provides an independent predictor of UM patient survival and represents a starting point for further investigation of GRGs in UM. It offers a novel perspective on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of UM.",2023,2023-03-23 00:00:00,40.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a015a1f1b2a2acfc4547f6f5fce1b65a57b4d8a3
10.3389/fimmu.2023.1091218,"Circadian rhythm-related genes index: A predictor for HNSCC prognosis, immunotherapy efficacy, and chemosensitivity","Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common head and neck cancer and is highly aggressive and heterogeneous, leading to variable prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes. Circadian rhythm alterations in tumourigenesis are of equal importance to genetic factors and several biologic clock genes are considered to be prognostic biomarkers for various cancers. The aim of this study was to establish reliable markers based on biologic clock genes, thus providing a new perspective for assessing immunotherapy response and prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Methods We used 502 HNSCC samples and 44 normal samples from the TCGA-HNSCC dataset as the training set. 97 samples from GSE41613 were used as an external validation set. Prognostic characteristics of circadian rhythm-related genes (CRRGs) were established by Lasso, random forest and stepwise multifactorial Cox. Multivariate analysis revealed that CRRGs characteristics were independent predictors of HNSCC, with patients in the high-risk group having a worse prognosis than those in the low-risk group. The relevance of CRRGs to the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy was assessed by an integrated algorithm. Results 6-CRRGs were considered to be strongly associated with HNSCC prognosis and a good predictor of HNSCC. The riskscore established by the 6-CRRG was found to be an independent prognostic factor for HNSCC in multifactorial analysis, with patients in the low-risk group having a higher overall survival (OS) than the high-risk group. Nomogram prediction maps constructed from clinical characteristics and riskscore had good prognostic power. Patients in the low-risk group had higher levels of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint expression and were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusion 6-CRRGs play a key predictive role for the prognosis of HNSCC patients and can guide physicians in selecting potential responders to prioritise immunotherapy, which could facilitate further research in precision immuno-oncology.",2023,2023-03-10 00:00:00,55.0,87.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a219d3fa9537f2c44ef9735cc00f4bbede0d71b8

Growing evidence shows that insomnia is a risk factor for numerous diseases, including common infections and autoimmune diseases. Levels of inflammatory markers also seem to be abnormal in sleep deficient individuals, which may lead to low-grade inflammation.

In pancreatic β-cells, both lipid- and Ca2+ signaling are essential for insulin secretion. The recently characterized lipid transfer protein TMEM24 dynamically localize to ER-PM contact sites and provide phosphatidylinositol, a precursor of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2, to the plasma membrane. β-cells lacking TMEM24 exhibit markedly suppressed glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations and insulin secretion but the underlying mechanism is not known. We now show that TMEM24 only weakly interact with the PM, and dissociates in response to both diacylglycerol and nanomolar elevations of cytosolic Ca2+. Release of TMEM24 into the bulk ER membrane also enables direct interactions with mitochondria, and we report that loss of TMEM24 results in excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in both the ER and mitochondria and in impaired mitochondria function.",2021,2021-06-24 00:00:00,13.0,51.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c60ac5f523e68074b5a8fe8e2e36706caf7fe6a0

Based on the analysis of the structure and trypanolytic activity of APOL1, it was proposed that APOLs could function as ion channels of intracellular membranes and be involved in mechanisms triggering programmed cell death. In this review, the recent finding that APOL1 and APOL3 inversely control the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate (PI(4)P) by the Golgi PI(4)‐kinase IIIB (PI4KB) is commented. APOL3 promotes Ca2+‐dependent activation of PI4KB, but due to their increased interaction with APOL3, APOL1 C‐terminal variants can inactivate APOL3, leading to reduction of Golgi PI(4)P synthesis. The impact of APOLs on several pathological processes that depend on Golgi PI(4)P levels is discussed. I propose that through their effect on PI4KB activity, APOLs control not only actomyosin activities related to vesicular trafficking, but also the generation and elongation of autophagosomes induced by inflammation.",2020,2020-06-12 00:00:00,23.0,182.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bbb8d1007cb8a2ce12c8b8ad9a38b8bc2004c9b8
10.3390/en15176276,A Literature Review of the Challenges and Opportunities of the Transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0,"In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing and production systems were revolutionized by increasing operational efficiency and developing and implementing new business models, services, and products. Concretely, the milestone set for Industry 4.0 was to improve the sustainability and efficiency of production systems. By extension, the emphasis was focused on both the digitization and the digitalization of systems, providing room for further improvement. However, the current technological evolution is more system/machine-oriented, rather than human-oriented. Thus, several countries have begun orchestrating initiatives towards the design and development of the human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services, which has been coined as Industry 5.0. The impact of Industry 5.0 will extend to societal transformation, which eventually leads to the generation of a new society, the Society 5.0. The developments will be focused on the social and human-centric aspect of the tools and technologies introduced under the framework of Industry 4.0. Therefore, sustainability and human well-being will be at the heart of what comes next, the Industry 5.0, as a subset of Society 5.0. Industry 5.0 will build on the foundations laid during Industry 4.0 by emphasizing human-centered, resilient, and sustainable design. Consequently, the authors in this research work, through a critical literature review, aim to provide adequate reasoning for considering Industry 5.0 as a framework for enabling the coexistence of industry and emerging societal trends and needs. The contribution of this research work extends to the provision of a framework to facilitate the transition from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0.",2022,2022-08-28 00:00:00,219.0,75.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/842859523af8147114e9608b89904cf34b3e7448

However, it is often fraught with challenges in developing countries in respect of insufficient supporting manpower and attendant high cost of running effective services. In institutions where the services exist, not all students benefit from it as a result of some factors such as: the sub-optimal performance of the advising personnel; negative psychological complex in students arising from unusual egocentrism (especially in those students who are regarded as “low performers” and would prefer not to be openly confronted); handicapped students especially those students with visible handicaps e.g. speech problems, etc. This paper is the first part of a study aimed at creating a balance in the foregoing situations by presenting a design of a faceless automated “ AdvisorBot ” based on the bot framework. The design reflects a virtual support system model which could be adopted to enhance student support and course advising efficiency. Analysis of the existing system in most tertiary institutions in Nigeria reveals that student support services actually exist though not efficient in the sense that there are seldom specialized units/departments dedicated to this function in majority of the Institutions especially the public institutions where student advising is the work of academic staff in the various departments. The design follows a mix of the agent and object-oriented approaches and produces an implementation-ready specification whose full implementation would effectively support students during their studies.

However, given the complexity of learning analytics (LA) systems, it can be challenging to meaningfully involve non-technical stakeholders throughout their design and development. This article reports on the iterative co-design, development, and classroom evaluation of Konscia, a wearable, real-time awareness tool for teachers working in AI-enhanced K-12 classrooms. In the process, we argue that the co-design of LA systems requires new kinds of prototyping methods. We introduce one of our own prototyping methods, REs, to address unique challenges of co-prototyping LA tools. This work presents the first end-to-end demonstration of how non-technical stakeholders can participate throughout the whole design process for a complex LA system—from early generative phases to the selection and tuning of analytics to evaluation in real-world contexts. We conclude by providing methodological recommendations for future LA co-design efforts.

10.1002/psp4.12944,Computational design of clinical trials using a combination of simulation and the genetic algorithm,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has come to be used in various technological fields in recent years. However, there have been no reports of AI‐designed clinical trials. In this study, we tried to develop study designs by a genetic algorithm (GA), which is an AI solution for combination optimization problems. Specifically, the computational design approach was applied to optimize the blood sampling schedule for a bioequivalence (BE) study in pediatrics and optimize the allocation of dose groups for a dose‐finding study. The GA could reduce the number of blood collection points from 15 (typical standard) to seven points without meaningful impact on the accuracy and precision of the pharmacokinetic estimation for the pediatric BE study. For the dose‐finding study, up to 10% reduction of the total number of required subjects from the standard design could be achieved. The GA also created a design that would lead to a drastic reduction of the required number of subjects in the placebo arm while keeping the total number of subjects at a minimum level. These results indicated the potential usefulness of the computational clinical study design approach for innovative drug development.",2023,2023-02-15 00:00:00,2.0,50.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3c28887e55f781aa31f131e510e9840bcafb176

10.30630/joiv.7.4.1608,Storychart: A Character Interaction Chart for Visualizing the Activities Flow,"Event-predicate-based storyline extraction results in a chronologically ordered activity journal. The extraction results contain complex human activities, so the activity journal requires a visualization model to describe actor interactions. This paper proposes a chart to visualize the activities' flow to describe the characters' interactions in an activity journal. This chart is called a storychart. Storycharts have an actor channel that can accept single entities or teams. The actor channel allows changing the type from single to a team or vice versa and moving members to other teams. The activity channel serves as a connector to accommodate interactions between actors. The activity channel provides a visual space for the elements of what, where, and when. Event predicates are the core of what. Therefore, the storychart visualizes the event predicate using glyphs to attract the reader’s attention. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a team channel that can visualize the identity of team members and an activity channel that can visualize the details of events. We invited participants to discover the reader’s perception of the ease of team recognition and the integrity of the meaning of the narrative visualized by the storychart. Participants involved in the evaluation were filtered by literacy score. Evaluation of storychart reading showed that readers could easily distinguish teams from single actors, and storycharts could convey the story in the activity journal with little reduction in meaning.",2023,2023-12-22 00:00:00,1.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cd16d62dedb9da5134aab2a38a400b7b49fbdb5

10.3390/bioengineering10030320,Optimization System Based on Convolutional Neural Network and Internet of Medical Things for Early Diagnosis of Lung Cancer,"Recently, deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been widely used in the healthcare monitoring system for decision making. Disease prediction is one of the emerging applications in current practices. In the method described in this paper, lung cancer prediction is implemented using deep learning and IoT, which is a challenging task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Because lung cancer is a dangerous medical disease that must be identified at a higher detection rate, disease-related information is obtained from IoT medical devices and transmitted to the server. The medical data are then processed and classified into two categories, benign and malignant, using a multi-layer CNN (ML-CNN) model. In addition, a particle swarm optimization method is used to improve the learning ability (loss and accuracy). This step uses medical data (CT scan and sensor information) based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For this purpose, sensor information and image information from IoMT devices and sensors are gathered, and then classification actions are taken. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with well-known existing methods, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and conventional CNN, in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, and computation time. For this purpose, two lung datasets were tested to evaluate the performance: Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Linear Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS) datasets. Compared to alternative methods, the trial outcomes showed that the suggested technique has the potential to help the radiologist make an accurate and efficient early lung cancer diagnosis. The performance of the proposed ML-CNN was analyzed using Python, where the accuracy (2.5–10.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, precision (2.3–9.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, sensitivity (2.4–12.5%) was high when compared to several instances, the F-score (2–30%) was high when compared to the number of cases, the error rate (0.7–11.5%) was low compared to the number of cases, and the computation time (170 ms to 400 ms) was low compared to how many cases were computed for the proposed work, including previous known methods. The proposed ML-CNN architecture shows that this technique outperforms previous works.",2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,26.0,36.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1343722d62888cca127860c68c65e533f7441e1c

Here, we report recent developments with InterPro (version 90.0) and its associated software, including updates to data content and to the website. These developments extend and enrich the information provided by InterPro, and provide a more user friendly access to the data. Additionally, we have worked on adding Pfam website features to the InterPro website, as the Pfam website will be retired in late 2022. We also show that InterPro's sequence coverage has kept pace with the growth of UniProtKB. Moreover, we report the development of a card game as a method of engaging the non-scientific community. Finally, we discuss the benefits and challenges brought by the use of artificial intelligence for protein structure prediction.",2022,2022-11-09 00:00:00,1312.0,31.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a991838f1147e7584bfcf645f0a688beead19b36
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010147,Correlations from structure and phylogeny combine constructively in the inference of protein partners from sequences,"Inferring protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important task in computational biology. Recent methods based on Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) or Mutual Information (MI) allow to find interaction partners among paralogs of two protein families. Does successful inference mainly rely on correlations from structural contacts or from phylogeny, or both? Do these two types of signal combine constructively or hinder each other? To address these questions, we generate and analyze synthetic data produced using a minimal model that allows us to control the amounts of structural constraints and phylogeny. We show that correlations from these two sources combine constructively to increase the performance of partner inference by DCA or MI. Furthermore, signal from phylogeny can rescue partner inference when signal from contacts becomes less informative, including in the realistic case where inter-protein contacts are restricted to a small subset of sites. We also demonstrate that DCA-inferred couplings between non-contact pairs of sites improve partner inference in the presence of strong phylogeny, while deteriorating it otherwise. Moreover, restricting to non-contact pairs of sites preserves inference performance in the presence of strong phylogeny. In a natural data set, as well as in realistic synthetic data based on it, we find that non-contact pairs of sites contribute positively to partner inference performance, and that restricting to them preserves performance, evidencing an important role of phylogeny. Author summary In protein sequence data, the amino acid usages at different sites of a protein or of two interacting proteins can be correlated because of functional constraints. For instance, the need to maintain physicochemical complementarity among two sites that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of a protein complex causes such correlations. However, correlations can also arise due to shared evolutionary history, even in the absence of any functional constraint. While these phylogenetic correlations are known to obscure the inference of structural contacts, we show, using controlled synthetic data, that correlations from structure and phylogeny combine constructively to allow the inference of protein partners among paralogs using just sequences. We also show that pairs of amino acids that are not in contact in the structure have a major impact on partner inference in a natural data set and in realistic synthetic ones. These findings explain the success of methods based on pairwise maximum-entropy models or on information theory at predicting protein partners from sequences among paralogs.",2021,2021-11-22 00:00:00,11.0,90.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a60d73f191fc113c3c8f3e450225c10a616d5332

10.1038/s41467-022-28865-w,Improved prediction of protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold2,"Predicting the structure of interacting protein chains is a fundamental step towards understanding protein function. Unfortunately, no computational method can produce accurate structures of protein complexes. AlphaFold2, has shown unprecedented levels of accuracy in modelling single chain protein structures. Here, we apply AlphaFold2 for the prediction of heterodimeric protein complexes. We find that the AlphaFold2 protocol together with optimised multiple sequence alignments, generate models with acceptable quality (DockQ ≥ 0.23) for 63% of the dimers. From the predicted interfaces we create a simple function to predict the DockQ score which distinguishes acceptable from incorrect models as well as interacting from non-interacting proteins with state-of-art accuracy. We find that, using the predicted DockQ scores, we can identify 51% of all interacting pairs at 1% FPR. Predicting the structure of protein complexes is extremely difficult. Here, authors apply AlphaFold2 with optimized multiple sequence alignments to model complexes of interacting proteins, enabling prediction of both if and how proteins interact with state-of-art accuracy.",2021,2021-10-05 00:00:00,613.0,59.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfabd934d91231c536712271a8627e8eaa84ade7

10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2,Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold,"Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm. AlphaFold predicts protein structures with an accuracy competitive with experimental structures in the majority of cases using a novel deep learning architecture.",2021,2021-07-15 00:00:00,24753.0,93.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc32a984b651256a8ec282be52310e6bd33d9815

Recently, sequence coevolution-based approaches have led to a breakthrough in predicting monomer protein structures and protein interaction interfaces. Here, we address the challenges of large-scale interaction prediction at residue resolution with a fast alignment concatenation method and a probabilistic score for the interaction of residues. Importantly, this method (EVcomplex2) is able to assess the likelihood of a protein interaction, as we show here applied to large-scale experimental datasets where the pairwise interactions are unknown. We predict 504 interactions de novo in the E. coli membrane proteome, including 243 that are newly discovered. While EVcomplex2 does not require available structures, coevolving residue pairs can be used to produce structural models of protein interactions, as done here for membrane complexes including the Flagellar Hook-Filament Junction and the Tol/Pal complex. Our understanding of the residue-level details of protein interactions remains incomplete. Here, the authors show sequence coevolution can be used to infer interacting proteins with residue-level details, including predicting 467 interactions de novo in the Escherichia coli cell envelope proteome.",2021,2021-03-02 00:00:00,74.0,60.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5df9975e9293e456460881305056a2164541a51d

10.3390/rs14153606,A Combination of Machine Learning Algorithms for Marine Plastic Litter Detection Exploiting Hyperspectral PRISMA Data,"A significant amount of the produced solid waste reaching the oceans is made of plastics. The amount of plastic debris in the ocean and coastal areas is steadily increasing and is now a major global environmental issue. The monitoring of marine plastic litter, ground-based monitoring systems and/or field campaigns are time-consuming, expensive, require great organisational efforts, and provide very limited information in terms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of marine debris. Earth Observation (EO) by satellite can contribute significantly to marine plastic litter detection. In 2019, a new hyperspectral satellite, called PRISMA, was launched by the Italian Space Agency. The high spectral resolution of PRISMA may allow for better detection of floating plastic materials. At the same time, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to find hidden patterns and identify complex relations among data and are increasingly employed in EO. This paper presents the development of a new method of identifying floating plastic objects in coastal areas by exploiting pan-sharpened hyperspectral PRISMA data, based on the combination of unsupervised and supervised ML algorithms. The study consisted of a configuration phase, during which the algorithms were trained in a fully controlled test, and a validation phase, in which the pre-trained algorithms were applied to satellite data collected at different sites and in different periods of the year. Despite the limited input data, results suggest that the tested ML approach, applied to pan-sharpened PRISMA data, can effectively recognise floating objects and plastic targets. The study indicates that increasing input datasets can help achieve higher-quality results.",2022,2022-07-28 00:00:00,24.0,23.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/420eabb53ab226e2a107a76f92db3578bb9e8d8a

10.3390/jmse10040481,Lagrangian Modeling of Marine Microplastics Fate and Transport: The State of the Science,"Microplastics pollution has led to irreversible environmental consequences and has triggered global concerns. It has been shown that water resources and marine food consumers are adversely affected by microplastics due to their physico-chemical characteristics. This study attempts to comprehensively review the structure of four well-known Lagrangian particle-tracking models, i.e., Delft3D—Water Quality Particle tracking module (D-WAQ PART), Ichthyoplankton (Ichthyop), Track Marine Plastic Debris (TrackMPD), and Canadian Microplastic Simulation (CaMPSim-3D) in simulating the fate and transport of microplastics. Accordingly, the structure of each model is investigated with respect to addressing the involved physical transport processes (including advection, diffusion, windage, beaching, and washing-off) and transformation processes (particularly biofouling and degradation) that play key roles in microplastics’ behavior in the marine environment. In addition, the effects of the physical properties (mainly size, diameter, and shape) of microplastics on their fate and trajectories are reviewed. The models’ capabilities and shortcomings in the simulation of microplastics are also discussed. The present review sheds light on some aspects of microplastics’ behavior in water that were not properly addressed in particle-tracking models, such as homo- and hetero-aggregation, agglomeration, photodegradation, and chemical and biological degradation as well as additional advection due to wave-induced drift. This study can be regarded as a reliable steppingstone for the future modification of the reviewed models.",2022,2022-03-30 00:00:00,31.0,124.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67ccdd1f0e7a9a0d46a68116766ae77ac402cf3b
10.1017/jfm.2022.95,Enhanced settling and dispersion of inertial particles in surface waves,"Abstract Particulate matter in the environment, such as sediment, marine debris and plankton, is transported by surface waves. The transport of these inertial particles is different from that of fluid parcels described by Stokes drift. In this study, we consider the transport of negatively buoyant particles that settle in flow induced by surface waves as described by linear wave theory in arbitrary depth. We consider particles that fall under both a linear drag regime in the low Reynolds number limit and in a nonlinear drag regime in the transitional Reynolds number range. Based on an analysis of typical applications, we find that the nonlinear regime is the most widely applicable. From an expansion in the particle Stokes number, we find kinematic expressions for inertial particle motion in waves, and from a multiscale expansion in the dimensionless wave amplitude, we find expressions for the wave-averaged drift velocities. These drift velocities are analogous to Stokes drift and can be used in large-scale models that do not resolve surface waves. We find that the horizontal drift velocity is reduced relative to the Stokes drift of fluid parcels and that the vertical drift velocity is enhanced relative to the particle terminal settling velocity. We also demonstrate that a cloud of settling particles released simultaneously will disperse in the horizontal direction. Finally, we discuss the accuracy of our expressions by comparing against numerical simulations, which show excellent agreement, and against experimental data, which show the same trends.",2022,2022-02-18 00:00:00,19.0,20.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab81fe4be716c8180098e6d86efada93118801fc
10.1111/jonm.13770,Trends in Artificial Intelligence in Nursing: Impacts on Nursing Management.,"OBJECTIVE
Investigate the academic use of artificial intelligence in nursing.


BACKGROUND
Bibliometric analysis combined with the VOSviewer software quantification method has been utilized for literature analysis. In recent years, this approach has attracted the interest of scholars in various research fields. Thus far, there is no publication using bibliometric analysis combined with the VOSviewer software to analyze the applications of artificial intelligence in nursing.


METHOD
A bibliometric analysis methodology was used to search for relevant articles published between 1984 and March 2022. Six databases, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, WoS, and MEDLINE, were included to identify relevant studies, and data such as the year of publication, journals, country, institutional source, field, and keywords were analyzed.


RESULTS
Most relevant articles were published from institutions in the United States of America. The League of European Research Universities has published most research studies that use artificial intelligence and nursing. Scholars have mainly focused on nursing, medical informatics, computer science AI, health care sciences services, and physics particles fields. Commonly used keywords were machine learning, care, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, prediction, and nurse.


CONCLUSION
Research articles were mainly published in Nurse Education Today. Research topics such as artificial intelligence-assisted medical recording and medical decision-making were also identified. According to this study, artificial intelligence in nursing has the potential to attract more attention from researchers and nursing managers. Additional high-quality research beyond the scope of medical education, as well as on cross-domain collaboration, is warranted to explore the acceptability and effective implementation of artificial intelligence technologies.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
This study provides scholars and nursing managers with structured information regarding the use of artificial intelligence in nursing based on scientific and technological developments across different fields and institutions. The application of artificial intelligence can improve nursing management, nursing quality, safety management, and team communication, as well as encourage future international collaboration.",2022,2022-08-15 00:00:00,29.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/301a55d4dc9919653587d2ab47dd25be67a92747
10.3390/healthcare10081571,Robots and Robotics in Nursing,"Technological advancements have led to the use of robots as prospective partners to complement understaffing and deliver effective care to patients. This article discusses relevant concepts on robots from the perspective of nursing theories and robotics in nursing and examines the distinctions between human beings and healthcare robots as partners and robot development examples and challenges. Robotics in nursing is an interdisciplinary discipline that studies methodologies, technologies, and ethics for developing robots that support and collaborate with physicians, nurses, and other healthcare workers in practice. Robotics in nursing is geared toward learning the knowledge of robots for better nursing care, and for this purpose, it is also to propose the necessary robots and develop them in collaboration with engineers. Two points were highlighted regarding the use of robots in health care practice: issues of replacing humans because of human resource understaffing and concerns about robot capabilities to engage in nursing practice grounded in caring science. This article stresses that technology and artificial intelligence are useful and practical for patients. However, further research is required that considers what robotics in nursing means and the use of robotics in nursing.",2022,2022-08-01 00:00:00,31.0,59.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b582e6aa81b3c98d20c0ab7caa7139a3ac56dea1

10.3389/fonc.2022.843735,The Global Research of Artificial Intelligence on Prostate Cancer: A 22-Year Bibliometric Analysis,"Background With the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of a variety of diseases, including prostate cancer. Facts have proved that AI has broad prospects in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Objective This study mainly summarizes the research on the application of artificial intelligence in the field of prostate cancer through bibliometric analysis and explores possible future research hotspots. Methods The articles and reviews regarding application of AI in prostate cancer between 1999 and 2020 were selected from Web of Science Core Collection on August 23, 2021. Microsoft Excel 2019 and GraphPad Prism 8 were applied to analyze the targeted variables. VOSviewer (version 1.6.16), Citespace (version 5.8.R2), and a widely used online bibliometric platform were used to conduct co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field. Results A total of 2,749 articles were selected in this study. AI-related research on prostate cancer increased exponentially in recent years, of which the USA was the most productive country with 1,342 publications, and had close cooperation with many countries. The most productive institution and researcher were the Henry Ford Health System and Tewari. However, the cooperation among most institutions or researchers was not close even if the high research outputs. The result of keyword analysis could divide all studies into three clusters: “Diagnosis and Prediction AI-related study”, “Non-surgery AI-related study”, and “Surgery AI-related study”. Meanwhile, the current research hotspots were “deep learning” and “multiparametric MRI”. Conclusions Artificial intelligence has broad application prospects in prostate cancer, and a growing number of scholars are devoted to AI-related research on prostate cancer. Meanwhile, the cooperation among various countries and institutions needs to be strengthened in the future. It can be projected that noninvasive diagnosis and accurate minimally invasive treatment through deep learning technology will still be the research focus in the next few years.",2022,2022-03-01 00:00:00,74.0,76.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fdf9a9bbb3cd304706bcb8f2b4fb7e89327439e

10.2196/29839,Application of Artificial Intelligence in Community-Based Primary Health Care: Systematic Scoping Review and Critical Appraisal,"Background Research on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into community-based primary health care (CBPHC) has highlighted several advantages and disadvantages in practice regarding, for example, facilitating diagnosis and disease management, as well as doubts concerning the unintended harmful effects of this integration. However, there is a lack of evidence about a comprehensive knowledge synthesis that could shed light on AI systems tested or implemented in CBPHC. Objective We intended to identify and evaluate published studies that have tested or implemented AI in CBPHC settings. Methods We conducted a systematic scoping review informed by an earlier study and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review framework and reported the findings according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-Scoping Reviews) reporting guidelines. An information specialist performed a comprehensive search from the date of inception until February 2020, in seven bibliographic databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore. The selected studies considered all populations who provide and receive care in CBPHC settings, AI interventions that had been implemented, tested, or both, and assessed outcomes related to patients, health care providers, or CBPHC systems. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the identified records, read the selected full texts, and extracted data from the included studies using a validated extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if this was not possible, the opinion of a third reviewer was sought. A third reviewer also validated all the extracted data. Results We retrieved 22,113 documents. After the removal of duplicates, 16,870 documents were screened, and 90 peer-reviewed publications met our inclusion criteria. Machine learning (ML) (41/90, 45%), natural language processing (NLP) (24/90, 27%), and expert systems (17/90, 19%) were the most commonly studied AI interventions. These were primarily implemented for diagnosis, detection, or surveillance purposes. Neural networks (ie, convolutional neural networks and abductive networks) demonstrated the highest accuracy, considering the given database for the given clinical task. The risk of bias in diagnosis or prognosis studies was the lowest in the participant category (4/49, 4%) and the highest in the outcome category (22/49, 45%). Conclusions We observed variabilities in reporting the participants, types of AI methods, analyses, and outcomes, and highlighted the large gap in the effective development and implementation of AI in CBPHC. Further studies are needed to efficiently guide the development and implementation of AI interventions in CBPHC settings.",2021,2021-09-01 00:00:00,63.0,90.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c27ad9346f384e828a4cd6dc8e7e724ea54bd1a2

10.1093/police/paac074,What does the UK Police National Database tell us about the future of police intelligence?,"
 Developments in technology are transforming society, creating more opportunities for offenders and complicating the policing landscape. The challenge for law enforcement is to identify criminal patterns from an offender’s electronic traces and to provide actionable intelligence. However, these traces are held by diverse police forces and are rarely connected. In 2011, to overcome this challenge, the Police National Database (PND) was launched to provide a national intelligence overview from local data. This study examines the database, using a mixed-methods approach. Descriptive and inferential analyses of PND usage data highlight that different forces use the PND, and its various capabilities, with different levels of frequency. Thematic analyses of interviews and focus groups with PND users identified: specific examples of PND use, as well as its perceived strengths, perceived deficiencies, and future considerations. Implications for policing practice are discussed.",2022,2022-09-02 00:00:00,6.0,61.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b5a6f3d218fc08c890fc411dca2dc77dc7a476b

10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00299-2,Putting human behavior predictability in context,"Various studies have investigated the predictability of different aspects of human behavior such as mobility patterns, social interactions, and shopping and online behaviors. However, the existing researches have been often limited to a single or to the combination of few behavioral dimensions, and they have adopted the perspective of an outside observer who is unaware of the motivations behind the specific behaviors or activities of a given individual. The key assumption of this work is that human behavior is deliberated based on an individual’s own perception of the situation that s/he is in, and that therefore it should also be studied under the same perspective. Taking inspiration from works in ubiquitous and context-aware computing, we investigate the role played by four contextual dimensions (or modalities), namely time, location, activity being carried out, and social ties, on the predictability of individuals’ behaviors, using a month of collected mobile phone sensor readings and self-reported annotations about these contextual modalities from more than two hundred study participants. Our analysis shows that any target modality (e.g. location) becomes substantially more predictable when information about the other modalities (time, activity, social ties) is made available. Multi-modality turns out to be in some sense fundamental, as some values (e.g. specific activities like “shopping”) are nearly impossible to guess correctly unless the other modalities are known. Subjectivity also has a substantial impact on predictability. A location recognition experiment suggests that subjective location annotations convey more information about activity and social ties than objective information derived from GPS measurements. We conclude the paper by analyzing how the identified contextual modalities allow to compute the diversity of personal behavior, where we show that individuals are more easily identified by rarer, rather than frequent, context annotations. These results offer support in favor of developing innovative computational models of human behaviors enriched by a characterization of the context of a given behavior.",2021,2021-08-13 00:00:00,26.0,65.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c8197bf60fdf0319a56a280c5e768fb9a73711e

We conducted a genome-wide association study focused on evaluation and preliminary discovery of colorectal cancer risk factors in Indonesians. We administered detailed questionnaires and collecting blood samples from 162 colorectal cancer cases throughout Makassar, Indonesia. We also established a control set of 193 healthy individuals frequency matched by age, sex, and ethnicity. A genome-wide association analysis was performed on 84 cases and 89 controls passing quality control. We evaluated known colorectal cancer genetic variants using logistic regression and established a genome-wide polygenic risk model using a Bayesian variable selection technique. We replicate associations for rs9497673, rs6936461 and rs7758229 on chromosome 6; rs11255841 on chromosome 10; and rs4779584, rs11632715, and rs73376930 on chromosome 15. Polygenic modeling identified 10 SNP associated with colorectal cancer risk. This work helps characterize the relationship between variants in the SCL22A3, SCG5, GREM1, and STXBP5-AS1 genes and colorectal cancer in a diverse Indonesian population.

Here we present, HaploNet, a method for performing dimensionality reduction and clustering of genetic data. The method is based on local clustering of phased haplotypes using neural networks from whole-genome sequencing or dense genotype data. By utilizing Gaussian mixtures in a variational autoencoder framework, we are able to learn a low-dimensional latent space in which we cluster haplotypes along the genome in a highly scalable manner. We demonstrate that we can use haplotype clusters in the latent space to infer global population structure utilizing haplotype information by exploiting the generative properties of our framework. Based on fitted neural networks and its latent haplotype clusters, we can perform principal component analysis and estimate ancestry proportions based on a maximum likelihood framework. Using sequencing data from simulations and closely related human populations, we demonstrate that our approach is better at distinguishing closely related populations than standard admixture and principal component analysis software. We further show that HaploNet is fast and highly scalable by applying it to genotype array data of the UK Biobank.",2020,2020-12-28 00:00:00,17.0,73.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e5e59861b8197320859558d4352c14dec6d8496a
10.28919/cmbn/4653,Phosphorylation site prediction using gradient tree boosting,"As one of the most important Post-Translational Modification (PTM), phosphorylation is responsible for cellular signaling pathways and activation of enzymes. With current computational power and algorithm, it is possible to process big data, especially biomedical data, to find a complicated pattern with reasonable computation time. Computational approach for phosphorylation site prediction is more time-efficient and need fewer resources com-pared to traditional. However, the accuracy of current computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction still needs to be improved. This paper aims to create a computational method for phosphorylation site prediction with better classification performance compared to previous studies. The data used in this research to train the XGBoost models are extracted features from 2 different databases from the previous studies. The test result show that our model gave the highest accuracy on 4 out of 6 datasets. To extend our research, the XGBoost model was retrained which focused on 100 most important features from previous experiment.

This allows us to predict the location of origin of a genetic sample by comparing it to a set of samples of known geographic origin.

In simulations, Locator infers sample location to within 4.1 generations of dispersal and runs at least an order of magnitude faster than a recent model-based approach. We leverage Locator’s computational efficiency to predict locations separately in windows across the genome, which allows us to both quantify uncertainty and describe the mosaic ancestry and patterns of geographic mixing that characterize many populations.

10.3322/caac.21551,"Cancer statistics, 2019","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data, available through 2015, were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data, available through 2016, were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2019, 1,762,450 new cancer cases and 606,880 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Over the past decade of data, the cancer incidence rate (2006‐2015) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2% per year in men, whereas the cancer death rate (2007‐2016) declined annually by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively. The overall cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2016 by a total of 27%, translating into approximately 2,629,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the racial gap in cancer mortality is slowly narrowing, socioeconomic inequalities are widening, with the most notable gaps for the most preventable cancers. For example, compared with the most affluent counties, mortality rates in the poorest counties were 2‐fold higher for cervical cancer and 40% higher for male lung and liver cancers during 2012‐2016. Some states are home to both the wealthiest and the poorest counties, suggesting the opportunity for more equitable dissemination of effective cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies. A broader application of existing cancer control knowledge with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups would undoubtedly accelerate progress against cancer.",2019,2019-01-01 00:00:00,17477.0,100.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b12ed47d5718d1e7b99ac9541aa5a0ee9bf5116

10.1371/journal.pone.0118210,Trametinib with or without Vemurafenib in BRAF Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"V-Raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B (BRAF) mutated lung cancer is relatively aggressive and is resistant to currently available therapies. In a recent phase II study for patients with BRAF-V600E non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BRAF V600E inhibitor demonstrated evidence of activity, but 30% of this selected group progressed while on treatment, suggesting a need for developing alternative strategies. We tested two different options to enhance the efficacy of vemurafenib (BRAF V600E inhibitor) in BRAF mutated NSCLC. The first option was the addition of erlotinib to vemurafenib to see whether the combination provided synergy. The second was to induce MEK inhibition (downstream of RAF) with trametinib (MEK inhibitor). We found that the combination of vemurafenib and erlotinib was not synergistic to the inhibition of p-ERK signaling in BRAF-V600E cells. Vemurafenib caused significant apoptosis, G1 arrest and upregulation of BIM in BRAF-V600 cells. Trametinib was effective as a single agent in BRAF mutated cells, either V600E or non-V600E. Finally, the combination of vemurafenib and trametinib caused a small but significant increase in apoptosis as well as a significant upregulation of BIM when compared to either single agent. Thus, hinting at the possibility of utilizing a combinational approach for the management of this group of patients. Importantly, trametinib alone caused upregulation of p-AKT in BRAF non-V600 mutated cells, while this effect was nullified with the combination. This finding suggests that, the combination of a MEK inhibitor with a BRAF inhibitor will be more efficacious in the clinical setting for patients with BRAF mutated NSCLC.",2015,2015-02-23 00:00:00,54.0,38.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8dd6f59654cbb4f16886ce66ca5f13f5493992a7

10.1038/s41598-021-95027-1,Application of RR-XGBoost combined model in data calibration of micro air quality detector,"Grid monitoring is the current development direction of atmospheric monitoring. The micro air quality detector is of great help to the grid monitoring of the atmosphere, so higher requirements are put forward for the accuracy of the micro air quality detector. This paper presents a model to calibrate the measurement data of the micro air quality detector using the monitoring data of the air quality monitoring station. The concentration of six types of air pollutants is the research object of this study to establish a calibration model for the measurement data of the micro air quality detector. The first step is to use correlation analysis to find out the main factors affecting the concentration of the six types of pollutants. The second step uses Ridge Regression (RR) to select variables, find out the factors that have significant effects on the concentration of pollutants, and give the quantitative relationship between these factors and the pollutants. Finally, the predicted value of the ridge regression model and the measurement data of the micro air quality detector are used as input variables, and the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is used to give the final pollutant concentration prediction model. We named the combined model of ridge regression and XGBoost algorithm RR-XGBoost model. Relative Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), goodness of fit (R2), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the RR-XGBoost model. The results show that the model is superior to some commonly used pollutant prediction methods such as random forest, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron neural network in the evaluation of various indicators. The model not only has a good prediction effect on the training set but also on the test set, indicating that the model has good generalization ability. Using the RR-XGBoost model to calibrate the data of the micro air quality detector can make up for the shortcomings of the data monitoring accuracy of the micro air quality detector.

10.1038/s41598-023-44515-7,A novel fractional-order dead-time compensating controller for the wireless networks,"Wireless technology is becoming increasingly critical in industrial environments in recent years, and the popular wireless standards are WirelessHART, ZigBee, WLAN and ISA100.11a, commonly used in closed-loop systems. However, wireless networks in closed-loop control experience packet loss or drops, system delay and data threats, leading to process instability and catastrophic system failure. To prevent such issues, it is necessary to implement dead-time compensation control. Traditional techniques like model predictive and predictive PI controllers are frequently employed. However, these methods’ performance is sluggish in wireless networks, with processes having long dead times and set-point variations, potentially affecting network and process performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a fractional calculus-based predictive PI compensator for wired and wireless networks in the process control industries. The proposed technique has been simulated and evaluated on industrial process models, including pressure, flow, and temperature, where measurement and control are carried out wirelessly. The wireless network’s performance has been evaluated based on packet loss, reduced throughput, and increased system latency. The proposed compensator outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating superior set-point tracking, disturbance rejection, and delay compensation characteristics in the performance evaluations of the first, second, and third-order systems. Overall, the findings indicate that the proposed compensator enhances wireless networks’ performance in the process control industry and improves system stability and reliability by reducing almost half of the overshoot and settling an average of 8.3927% faster than the conventional techniques in most of the systems.",2023,2023-10-17 00:00:00,5.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24cc78707b80c975d952a9ceb256b16c36fd86ee

10.3390/bioengineering10040418,A Comparative Study on Predication of Appropriate Mechanical Ventilation Mode through Machine Learning Approach,"Ventilation mode is one of the most crucial ventilator settings, selected and set by knowledgeable critical care therapists in a critical care unit. The application of a particular ventilation mode must be patient-specific and patient-interactive. The main aim of this study is to provide a detailed outline regarding ventilation mode settings and determine the best machine learning method to create a deployable model for the appropriate selection of ventilation mode on a per breath basis. Per-breath patient data is utilized, preprocessed and finally a data frame is created consisting of five feature columns (inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume, minimum pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and previous positive end-expiratory pressure) and one output column (output column consisted of modes to be predicted). The data frame has been split into training and testing datasets with a test size of 30%. Six machine learning algorithms were trained and compared for performance, based on the accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and precision. The output shows that the Random-Forest Algorithm was the most precise and accurate in predicting all ventilation modes correctly, out of the all the machine learning algorithms trained. Thus, the Random-Forest machine learning technique can be utilized for predicting optimal ventilation mode setting, if it is properly trained with the help of the most relevant data. Aside from ventilation mode, control parameter settings, alarm settings and other settings may also be adjusted for the mechanical ventilation process utilizing appropriate machine learning, particularly deep learning approaches.",2023,2023-03-27 00:00:00,5.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d21fca40744d877f9ebcbdec618a4d1aaef4d586

The aim of this study was to develop a classifier using a neural network to identify weak inspiratory efforts during PSV, based on the ventilator waveforms. Recordings of flow, airway, esophageal and gastric pressures from critically ill patients were used to create an annotated dataset, using data from 37 patients at 2–5 different levels of support, computing the inspiratory time and effort for every breath. The complete dataset was randomly split, and data from 22 patients (45,650 breaths) were used to develop the model. Using a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network, a predictive model was developed to characterize the inspiratory effort of each breath as weak or not, using a threshold of 50 cmH2O*s/min. The following results were produced by implementing the model on data from 15 different patients (31,343 breaths). The model predicted weak inspiratory efforts with a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 72%, positive predictive value of 40%, and negative predictive value of 96%.

10.1097/MD.0000000000029387,Analyzing adverse drug reaction using statistical and machine learning methods,"Abstract Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are unintended negative drug-induced responses. Determining the association between drugs and ADRs is crucial, and several methods have been proposed to demonstrate this association. This systematic review aimed to examine the analytical tools by considering original articles that utilized statistical and machine learning methods for detecting ADRs. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted based on articles published between 2015 and 2020. The keywords used were statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods for detecting ADR signals. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: We reviewed 72 articles, of which 51 and 21 addressed statistical and machine learning methods, respectively. Electronic medical record (EMR) data were exclusively analyzed using the regression method. For FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data, components of the disproportionality method were preferable. DrugBank was the most used database for machine learning. Other methods accounted for the highest and supervised methods accounted for the second highest. Conclusions: Using the 72 main articles, this review provides guidelines on which databases are frequently utilized and which analysis methods can be connected. For statistical analysis, >90% of the cases were analyzed by disproportionate or regression analysis with each spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data or electronic medical record (EMR) data; for machine learning research, however, there was a strong tendency to analyze various data combinations.

Methods and Results In this meta‐analysis we searched the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The studies were included if they were placebo‐controlled trials in design and reported SSRIs’ effects on poststroke depression, anxiety, disability, dependence, motor abilities, and cognitive functions. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for randomized trials. The search yielded 44 articles that included 16 164 patients, and about half of the participants were treated with SSRIs. Our results showed that SSRIs had a significant effect on preventing depression (weighted mean difference [WMD], −7.05 [95% CI, −11.78 to −2.31]), treating depression according to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (WMD, −1.45 [95% CI, −2.77 to −0.14]), anxiety (relative risk, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.09–0.61]), dependence (WMD, 8.86 [95% CI, 1.23–16.48]), motor abilities according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (WMD, −0.79 [95% CI, −1.42 to −0.15]), and cognitive functions (WMD, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.12–1.89]). On the other hand, no significant effect of SSRIs on disability was observed. Additionally, we found that treating with SSRIs increased the risk of seizures (relative risk, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.13–1.83]), whereas there was no difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms or bleeding between SSRIs and a placebo. Conclusions Our study showed that SSRIs are effective in preventing and treating depression, and improving anxiety, motor function, cognitive function, and dependence in patients after stroke. These benefits were only reproducible with the citalopram subanalysis but not fluoxetine. Further well‐conducted placebo‐controlled trials are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of citalopram among patients after stroke.

10.3390/ijerph19116665,Health Literacy Level and Comprehension of Prescription and Nonprescription Drug Information,"The aim of this study was to investigate the level of misunderstanding of medication information in Korean adults after stratifying by level of health literacy and to identify the factors influencing the misunderstanding of medication information and reading amounts of information on OTC drug labels. A cross-sectional survey was performed with 375 adult participants using the survey instrument. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors which influence misunderstanding of medication information. Participants misunderstood 20% of words on OTC drug labels, 9% of prescription drug instructions, and 9% of pictograms. Participants on average read 59% of the overall contents of the OTC drug labels. As prescription drugs’ dosing regimens became more complicated, the level of misunderstanding instructions increased. The level of misunderstanding words on OTC drug labels significantly decreased as participants had adequate health literacy (β = −18.11, p < 0.001) and higher education levels (β = −6.83, p < 0.001), after adjusting for the study variables. The level of misunderstanding instructions for prescription drugs increased as participants became older (β = 8.81, p < 0.001) and had lower education levels (β = −5.05, p < 0.001), after adjusting for the study variables. The level of misunderstanding pictograms was similar to that of misunderstanding instructions for prescription drug labels. The amount of reading information on OTC drug labels significantly increased as respondents had adequate health literacy (β = 9.27, p < 0.001), were older (β = 12.49, p < 0.001), or had chronic diseases (β = 7.49, p = 0.007).

Out of 82,239 patients with acute VTE, the proportion of high-risk patients according to the RIETE and VTE-BLEED scores was 7.1 and 62.3%, respectively. The performance of both scores across the different study periods (first 30 days after VTE diagnosis, days 31–90, days 91–180, and days 181–360) was similar, with areas under the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) ranging between 0.69 and 0.72. However, the positive predictive values were low, ranging between 0.6 and 3.9 (better for early major bleeding than for later periods). A sensitivity analysis limited to patients with unprovoked VTE showed comparable results. Both scores showed a trend toward a better prediction of extracranial than intracranial major bleeding, the RIETE score resulting more useful for early extracranial bleeding and the VTE-BLEED for late intracranial hemorrhages. Our study reveals that the usefulness of available bleeding scores may vary depending on the characteristics of the patient population and the time frame evaluated. Dynamic scores could be more useful for this purpose.",2021,2021-07-01 00:00:00,9.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d65f0f9940f96f7b3305492188f1b301f301f53

A general standard architecture of appropriate system has been developed using methods and personalization tools in the Internet environment with a core of automated recommendation of tags (categories) in the form of a neural network with controlled training. A personalized approach to the web site user results in a higher rate of sales. The system that was developed on the basis of modern SEO technologies considering the metrics for assessing the operation of an information and search module in the system makes it possible to select relevant content according to the user's personalized interests. The system has classes and subclasses that include real commercial informational products, interrelated by the built logical links, whose application promotes the intelligent supply of content based on the personalization of needs and interests of the user. In addition, based on modern methods of Machine Learning, the designed system learns to refine the results from searching the content in demand according to the personalized user's preferences. Personalization algorithms make it possible to associate each user with a list of products that are most likely to be of interest, and can predict what customers may want to see even if they are not aware of it yet. The aim of the intelligent system of e-commerce is to represent unique content based on the personalization approach and the use of tags. In addition to a standard text introduction of categories and tags based on images and product descriptions, the designed automation process defines tags and product categories.

The mathematical models of wave propagation in oscillatory systems under certain initial conditions at a fixed time are well known in the literature. However, wave processes in lengthy structures subject to an external force only and at the assigned states of the process at two points in time have been insufficiently studied. Such processes are modeled by a two-point time problem for the inhomogeneous wave equation in an unbounded domain t>0, x∈ℝ s . The model takes into consideration the assignment of a linear combination with unknown amplitude of oscillations and the rate of its change at two points in time. A two-point problem, generally speaking, is the ill-posed boundary value problem, since the respective homogeneous problem has non-trivial solutions. A class of quasi-polynomials has been established as the class of the existence of a single solution to the problem. This class does not contain the non-trivial elements from the problem's kernel, which ensures the uniqueness of solution to the problem. We have proposed a precise method to build the solution in the specified class. The essence of the method is that the problem's solution is represented as the action of a differential expression, whose symbol is the right-hand side of the equation, on some function of parameters. The function is constructed in a special way using the equation and two-point conditions, and has special features associated with zeroes of the denominator – the characteristic determinant of the problem. The method is illustrated by the description of oscillatory processes within an infinite string and a membrane. The main practical application of the constructed method is the possibility to adequately mathematically model the oscillatory systems, which takes into consideration a possibility to control the system's parameters. Such a control over parameters makes it possible to perform optimal synthesis and design of parameters for the relevant technical systems in order to analyze and account for special features in the dynamic modes of oscillations",2019,2019-02-27 00:00:00,9.0,37.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5dd4e453a74e56d30b04bfbf4df2ce42ad99da1f

Integrating the recommender system effectively contributes to the prevention of disease, and it also leads to a reduction in treatment cost, which contributes to an improvement in the quality of life. At the same time, there exist various challenges within the recommender system, mainly cold start and scalability. To effectively address the inefficiencies, we propose combined hybrid methods in regard to machine learning. The primary aim of this learning method is to integrate the most effective and efficient learning algorithms to examine how combined hybrid filtering can help to improve the cold star problem efficiently in the provision of personalized well-being in regard to health food service. These methods include: (1) switching among content-based and collaborative filtering; (2) identifying the user context with the integration of dynamic filtering; and (3) learning the profiles with the help of processing and screening of reflecting feedback loops. The experimental results were evaluated by using three absolute error measures, providing comparable results with other studies relative to machine learning domains. The effects of using the hybrid learning method are gathered with the help of the experimental results.

The study was conducted with Ukrainian scientific and technical texts. The results of application of the designed algorithms of automatic attribution of the text content based on the NLP and stylemetry methods were analyzed. Prospects and features of application of stylemetry information technologies for attribution of the text content were considered. Quantitative content analysis of scientific and technical text content takes advantage of content monitoring and text content analysis based on NLP, Web-Mining and stylemetry methods to identify the multitude of authors whose talking style is similar to that of the analyzed text fragment. This narrows the range of search for further use in the stylemetry methods to determine the degree of belonging of the analyzed text to a particular author. Decomposition of the attribution method was carried out based on analysis of such talking coefficients as lexical diversity, degree (measure) of syntactic complexity, talking coherence, indexes of exclusivity and concentration of the text.

The features of the developed methods are the adaptation of the morphological and syntactic analysis of lexical units to the peculiarities of the structures of Ukrainian words/texts. That is, when analyzing linguistic units of the word type, their belonging to a part of speech and declension within this part of speech was taken into account. For this, the flections of these words for their classification, separation of the base for the formation of the corresponding alphabetic-frequency dictionaries were analyzed. Filling these dictionaries was subsequently taken into consideration at the following stages of the identification of the authorship of a text, such as the calculation of parameters and coefficients of the author's speech.

Materials and methods A total of 118 clinical VMAT plans, including 28 mediastina, 25 head and neck, 40 brains intensity‐modulated radiosurgery, and 25 prostate cases, were created in RayStation treatment planning system for Edge and TrueBeam linacs. In‐house scripts were developed to compute Modulation indices such as plan‐averaged beam area (PA), plan‐averaged beam irregularity (PI), total monitor unit (MU), leaf travel/arc length, mean dose rate variation, and mean gantry speed variation. Pretreatment verifications were performed on ArcCHECK phantom with SNC software. GPR was calculated with 3%/2 mm and 10% threshold. The dataset was randomly split into a training (70%) and a test (30%) dataset. A random forest regression (RFR) model and support vector regression (SVR) with linear kernel were trained to predict GPR using the complexity metrics as input. The prediction performance was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE), R 2, and root mean square error (RMSE). Results RMSEs at γ 3%/2 mm for RFR and SVR were 1.407 ± 0.103 and 1.447 ± 0.121, respectively. MAE was 1.14 ± 0.084 for RFR and 1.101 ± 0.09 for SVR. R 2 was equal to 0.703 ± 0.027 and 0.689 ± 0.053 for RFR and SVR, respectively. GPR of 3%/2 mm with a 10% threshold can be predicted with an error smaller than 3% for 94% of plans using RFR and SVR models. The most important metrics that had the greatest impact on how accurately GPR can be predicted were determined to be the PA, PI, and total MU. Conclusion In terms of its prediction values and errors, SVR (linear) appeared to be comparable with RFR for this dataset. Based on our results, the PA, PI, and total MU calculations may be useful in guiding VMAT plan evaluation and ultimately reducing uncertainties in planning and radiation delivery.",2022,2022-12-09 00:00:00,10.0,40.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c4cb0dbd57e34168cdc6c0a237f27ad2a0fe7c6
10.1002/mp.16091,Patient-specific quality assurance prediction models based on machine learning for novel dual-layer MLC linac.,"BACKGROUND
Patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) is an indispensable and essential procedure in radiotherapy workflow, and several studies have been done to develop prediction models based on the conventional C-arm linac of single-layer multileaf collimator (MLC) with machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict PSQA results and improve efficiency. Recently, a newly designed O-ring gantry linac 'Halcyon' equipped with unique jawless stacked-and-staggered dual-layer MLC was released. However, few studies have focused on developing PSQA prediction models for this novel dual-layer MLC system.


PURPOSE
To evaluate the performance of machine learning to predict PSQA results of fixed field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (FF-IMRT) plans for linac equipped with dual-layer MLC.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
213 FF-IMRT treatment plans, including 1383 beams from various treatment sites, were selected and delivered with portal dosimetry verification on Halcyon linac. Gamma analysis was performed using 1%/1mm, 2%/2mm, and 3%/2mm criteria with a 10% threshold. The training set (TS) of machine learning models consisted of 1106 beams, and an independent evaluation set (ES) consisted of 277 beams. For each beam, 33 complexity metrics were extracted as input data for training models. Three machine learning algorithms (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree/GBDT, Random Forest/RF, and Poisson Lasso/PL) were utilized to build the models and predict gamma passing rates (GPRs). To improve the prediction accuracy in the rare region, a method of reweighting for TS has been performed and compared to the unweighted results. The importance of complexity metrics was studied by permuted interesting features.


RESULTS
The GBDT model had the best performance in this study. In ES, the minimal mean prediction error for unweighted results was 1.93%, 1.16%, 0.78% under 1%/1mm, 2%/2mm, and 3%/2mm criteria respectively from GBDT model. Comparing to the unweighted results, the models after reweighting gained up to 30% improvement in the rare region, while the overall prediction error was slightly worse depending on the kind of models. For feature importance, two tree-based models (GBDT and RF) had in common the top 10 most important metrics as well as the same metric with the largest impact.


CONCLUSION
For linac equipped with novel dual-layer MLC, the machine learning model based on GBDT algorithm shows a certain degree of accuracy for GPRs prediction. The specific machine learning model for dual-layer MLC configuration could be a useful tool for physicists detecting PSQA measurement failures. This article is protected by copyright.

The MLC speed, acceleration and texture analysis features were extracted from 106 VMAT plans as predictors. Gamma passing rate (GPR) was collected as a response class with gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm and 3%/2 mm. The model was trained using two machine learning methods: AdaBoost classification and bagged regression trees model. GPR was classified into the “PASS” and “FAIL” for the classification model using the institutional warning level. The accuracy of the model was assessed using sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the accuracy of the regression model was determined using the difference between predicted and measured GPR. For the AdaBoost classification model, the sensitivity/specificity was 94.12%/100% and 63.63%/53.13% at gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm and 3%/2 mm, respectively. For the bagged regression trees model, the sensitivity/specificity was 94.12%/91.89% and 61.18%/68.75% at gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm and 3%/2 mm, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) of difference between predicted and measured GPR was found at 2.44 and 1.22 for gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm and 3%/2 mm, respectively.

Methods: One hundred and thirty-one H&N VMAT plans in our institution from 2019 to 2021 were retrospectively collected. Dosimetric verification for all plans was carried out using the portal dosimetry system integrated into the Eclipse treatment planning system based on the electronic portal imaging devices. Gamma passing rates (GPR) were analyzed using three gamma indices of 3%/3 mm, 3%/2 mm, and 2%/2 mm with a 10% dose threshold. Forty-eight conventional features affecting the dose delivery accuracy were used in the study, and 2,476 planomics features were extracted based on the radiotherapy plan file. Three prediction and classification models using conventional features (CF), planomics features (PF), and hybrid features (HF) combining two sets of features were constructed by the gradient boosting regressor (GBR) and Ridge classifier for each GPR of 3%/3 mm, 3%/2 mm, and 2%/2 mm, respectively. The absolute prediction error (APE) and the area under the curve (AUC) were adopted for assessing the performance of prediction and classification models. Results: In the GPR prediction, the average APE of the models using CF, PF, and HF was 1.3 ± 1.2%/3.6 ± 3.0%, 1.7 ± 1.5%/3.8 ± 3.5%, and 1.1 ± 1.0%/4.1 ± 3.1% for 2%/2 mm; 0.7 ± 0.6%/2.0 ± 2.0%, 1.0±1.1%/2.2 ± 1.8%, and 0.6 ± 0.6%/2.2 ± 1.9% for 3%/2 mm; and 0.4 ± 0.3%/1.2 ± 1.2%, 0.4±0.5%/1.3 ± 1.0%, and 0.3±0.3%/1.2 ± 1.1% for 3%/3 mm, respectively. In the regression prediction, three models give a similar modeling performance for predicting the GPR. The classification results were 0.67 ± 0.03/0.66 ± 0.07, 0.77 ± 0.03/0.73 ± 0.06, and 0.78 ± 0.02/0.75 ± 0.04 for 3%/3 mm, respectively. For 3%/2 mm, the AUCs of the training and testing cohorts were 0.64 ± 0.03/0.62 ± 0.07, 0.70 ± 0.03/0.67 ± 0.06, and 0.75 ± 0.03/0.71 ± 0.07, respectively, and for 2%/2 mm, the average AUCs of the training and testing cohorts were 0.72 ± 0.03/0.72 ± 0.06, 0.78 ± 0.04/0.73 ± 0.07, and 0.81 ± 0.03/0.75 ± 0.06, respectively. In the classification, the PF model has a better classification performance than the CF model. Moreover, the HF model provides the best result among the three classifications models.

10.1002/acm2.13375,Applications of machine and deep learning to patient‐specific IMRT/VMAT quality assurance,"Abstract In order to deliver accurate and safe treatment to cancer patients in radiation therapy using advanced techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric‐arc radiation therapy (VMAT), patient specific quality assurance (QA) should be performed before treatment. IMRT/VMAT dose measurements in a phantom using various devices have been clinically adopted as standard method for QA. This approach allows the verification of the accuracy of the dose calculation, data transfer, and the delivery system. However, patient‐specific QA procedures are expensive and require significant time and effort by the physicists. Over the past 5 years, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for predictions of IMRT/VMAT QA outcome have been investigated. Various ML and DL models have shown promising prediction accuracy and a high potential as time‐efficient virtual QA tool. In this paper, we review the ML and DL based models that were developed for patient specific IMRT and VMAT QA outcome predictions from algorithmic and clinical applicability perspectives. We focus on comparing the algorithms, the dataset sizes, the input parameters and features, the QA outcome prediction approaches, the validation, the performance, the clinical applicability, and the potential clinical impact. In addition, we discuss the present challenges as well as the future directions in the implementation of these models.

10.1515/nanoph-2023-0554,Integrated multi-operand optical neurons for scalable and hardware-efficient deep learning,"Abstract Optical neural networks (ONNs) are promising hardware platforms for next-generation neuromorphic computing due to their high parallelism, low latency, and low energy consumption. However, previous integrated photonic tensor cores (PTCs) consume numerous single-operand optical modulators for signal and weight encoding, leading to large area costs and high propagation loss to implement large tensor operations. This work proposes a scalable and efficient optical dot-product engine based on customized multi-operand photonic devices, namely multi-operand optical neuron (MOON). We experimentally demonstrate the utility of a MOON using a multi-operand-Mach–Zehnder-interferometer (MOMZI) in image recognition tasks. Specifically, our MOMZI-based ONN achieves a measured accuracy of 85.89 % in the street view house number (SVHN) recognition dataset with 4-bit voltage control precision. Furthermore, our performance analysis reveals that a 128 × 128 MOMZI-based PTCs outperform their counterparts based on single-operand MZIs by one to two order-of-magnitudes in propagation loss, optical delay, and total device footprint, with comparable matrix expressivity.",2023,2023-05-31 00:00:00,8.0,58.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d953eba62be149ca1cd7c243ff2782f546cf4fc

However, the computation rate of existing hardware is severely circumscribed by conventional Von Neumann architecture. Photonic approaches have demonstrated extraordinary potential for executing deep learning processes that involve complex calculations. In this work, an on-chip diffractive optical neural network (DONN) based on a silicon-on-insulator platform is proposed to perform machine learning tasks with high integration and low power consumption characteristics. To validate the proposed DONN, we fabricated 1-hidden-layer and 3-hidden-layer on-chip DONNs with footprints of 0.15 mm^2 and 0.3 mm^2 and experimentally verified their performance on the classification task of the Iris plants dataset, yielding accuracies of 86.7% and 90%, respectively. Furthermore, a 3-hidden-layer on-chip DONN is fabricated to classify the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwritten digit images. The proposed passive on-chip DONN provides a potential solution for accelerating future artificial intelligence hardware with enhanced performance. Integrating diffractive optical neural networks (DONN) would reduce errors due to bulky components and calibration.

In this work the authors enable optical convolution utilizing time-wavelength plane stretching approach on a microcomb-driven chip-based photonic processing unit. The emergence of parallel convolution-operation technology has substantially powered the complexity and functionality of optical neural networks (ONN) by harnessing the dimension of optical wavelength. However, this advanced architecture faces remarkable challenges in high-level integration and on-chip operation. In this work, convolution based on time-wavelength plane stretching approach is implemented on a microcomb-driven chip-based photonic processing unit (PPU). To support the operation of this processing unit, we develop a dedicated control and operation protocol, leading to a record high weight precision of 9 bits. Moreover, the compact architecture and high data loading speed enable a preeminent photonic-core compute density of over 1 trillion of operations per second per square millimeter (TOPS mm^−2). Two proof-of-concept experiments are demonstrated, including image edge detection and handwritten digit recognition, showing comparable processing capability compared to that of a digital computer.

10.3390/mi13111990,Micro Light Flow Controller on a Programmable Waveguide Engine,"A light flow controller that can regulate the three-port optical power in both lossless and lossy modus is realized on a programmable multimode waveguide engine. The microheaters on the waveguide chip mimic the tunable “pixels” that can continuously adjust the local refractive index. Compared to the conventional method where the tuning takes place only on single-mode waveguides, the proposed structure is more compact and requires less electrodes. The local index changes in a multimode waveguide can alter the mode numbers, field distribution, and propagation constants of each individual mode, all of which can alter the multimode interference pattern significantly. However, these changes are mostly complex and not governed by analytical equations as in the single-mode case. Though numerical simulations can be performed to predict the device response, the thermal and electromagnetic computing involved is mostly time-consuming. Here, a multi-level search program is developed based on experiments only. It can reach a target output in real time by adjusting the microheaters collectively and iteratively. It can also jump over local optima and further improve the cost function on a global level. With only a simple waveguide structure and four microheaters, light can be routed freely into any of the three output ports with arbitrary power ratios, with and without extra attenuation.

Tackling such challenge requires a combination of sophisticated theoretical and computational techniques. In this paper we combine machine-learning tools and the theory of quantum entanglement to perform entanglement classification for multipartite qubit systems in pure states.

This fundamental limitation is particularly severe for quantum algorithms where complex quantum observables are to be precisely evaluated. To achieve precise estimates with current methods, prohibitively large amounts of sample statistics are required in experiments. Here, we propose to reduce the measurement overhead by integrating artificial neural networks with quantum simulation platforms. We show that unsupervised learning of single-qubit data allows the trained networks to accommodate measurements of complex observables, otherwise costly using traditional post-processing techniques. The effectiveness of this hybrid measurement protocol is demonstrated for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians using both synthetic and experimental data.

Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, which affects daily life activities and social functioning. As life expectancy increases and demographic ageing occurs, the global prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is expected to continue to rise especially in developing countries, leading to a costly burden of disease. Alzheimer’s disease is a complex and multifactorial disorder that is determined by the interaction of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors across the life course. Epidemiological studies have identified potential modifiable risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease prevention. Moreover, Alzheimer’s disease is considered to start decades earlier before clinical symptoms occur, thus interventions targeting several risk factors in non-demented elderly people even middle-aged population might prevent or delay Alzheimer’s disease onset.

However, there are paradoxical APOE ɛ4 carriers who remain disease‐free and APOE ɛ2 carriers with LOAD. We compared exomes of healthy APOE ɛ4 carriers and APOE ɛ2 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, prioritizing coding variants based on their predicted functional impact, and identified 216 genes with differential mutational load between these two populations. These candidate genes were significantly dysregulated in LOAD brains, and many modulated tau‐ or β42‐induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Variants in these genes were associated with AD risk, even in APOE ɛ3 homozygotes, showing robust predictive power for risk stratification. Network analyses revealed involvement of candidate genes in brain cell type‐specific pathways including synaptic biology, dendritic spine pruning and inflammation.

The key signatures of the AD progression are the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, the formation of tau tangles, and the induction of detrimental neuroinflammation leading to neuronal loss. However, conventional pharmacotherapeutic options are merely relying on the alleviation of symptoms that are limited to mild to moderate AD patients. Moreover, some of these medicines discontinued to use due to either the insignificant effectiveness in improving the cognitive impairment or the adverse side effects worsening essential bodily functions. One of the reasons for the failure is the lack of knowledge on the underlying mechanisms that can accurately explain the major causes of the AD progression correlating to the severity of AD. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the better understanding of AD pathogenesis and the development of the disease-modifying treatments, particularly for severe and late-onset AD, which have not been covered thoroughly.

We encoded lexicon items into unique queries within an NLP software application and designed an algorithm to assign automated interpretations (‘positive’, ‘possible’, or ‘negative’) based on each report’s query profile. We evaluated algorithm performance in a sample of 2,466 CXR reports interpreted by physician consensus and in two ICU patient subgroups including those admitted for pneumonia and for rheumatologic/endocrine diagnoses.ResultsMost reports were deemed ‘negative’ (51.8%) by physician consensus. Many were ‘possible’ (41.7%); only 6.5% were ‘positive’ for pneumonia. The lexicon included 105 terms and uncertainty profiles that were encoded into 31 NLP queries. Queries identified 534,322 ‘hits’ in the full sample, with 2.7 ± 2.6 ‘hits’ per report. An algorithm, comprised of twenty rules and probability steps, assigned interpretations to reports based on query profiles. In the validation set, the algorithm had 92.7% sensitivity, 91.1% specificity, 93.3% positive predictive value, and 90.3% negative predictive value for differentiating ‘negative’ from ‘positive’/’possible’ reports. In the ICU subgroups, the algorithm also demonstrated good performance, misclassifying few reports (5.8%).ConclusionsMany CXR reports in ICU patients demonstrate frank uncertainty regarding a pneumonia diagnosis.

Methods A manual EMR review of 2747 outpatient ARI visits with associated chest imaging identified x-ray reports that could support the diagnosis of pneumonia (kappa score  = 0.88 (95% CI 0.82∶0.93)), along with attendant cases with Possible Pneumonia (adds either cough, sputum, fever/chills/night sweats, dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain) or with Pneumonia-in-Plan (adds pneumonia stated as a likely diagnosis by the provider). The x-ray reports served as a reference to develop a text classifier using machine-learning software that did not require custom coding. To identify pneumonia cases, the classifier was combined with EMR-based structured data and with text analyses aimed at ARI symptoms in clinical notes. Results 370 reference cases with Possible Pneumonia and 250 with Pneumonia-in-Plan were identified. The x-ray report text classifier increased the positive predictive value of otherwise identical EMR-based case-detection algorithms by 20–70%, while retaining sensitivities of 58–75%. These performance gains were independent of the case definitions and of whether patients were admitted to the hospital or sent home. Text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes did not add further value. Conclusion Specialized software development is not required for automated text analyses to help identify pneumonia patients. These results begin to map an efficient, replicable strategy through which EMR data can be used to stratify ARI severity.",2013,2013-08-13 00:00:00,35.0,52.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/366fc999ce59e4e87540725cbffc6dba73491942

10.3390/s18092946,"Performance Analysis of IoT-Based Sensor, Big Data Processing, and Machine Learning Model for Real-Time Monitoring System in Automotive Manufacturing","With the increase in the amount of data captured during the manufacturing process, monitoring systems are becoming important factors in decision making for management. Current technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes IoT-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an IoT-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of IoT-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that IoT-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input. The proposed system is expected to support management by improving decision-making and will help prevent unexpected losses caused by faults during the manufacturing process.",2018,2018-09-01 00:00:00,268.0,98.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1fdfcd4470c65aa1238d3a1719c60672c8a4f5b

Many approaches for RUL estimation based on sensor data make assumptions about how machines degrade. Additionally, sensor data from machines is noisy and often suffers from missing values in many practical settings. We propose Embed-RUL: a novel approach for RUL estimation from sensor data that does not rely on any degradation-trend assumptions, is robust to noise, and handles missing values. Embed-RUL utilizes a sequence-to-sequence model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate embeddings for multivariate time series subsequences. The embeddings for normal and degraded machines tend to be different, and are therefore found to be useful for RUL estimation. We show that the embeddings capture the overall pattern in the time series while filtering out the noise, so that the embeddings of two machines with similar operational behavior are close to each other, even when their sensor readings have significant and varying levels of noise content. We perform experiments on publicly available turbofan engine dataset and a proprietary real-world dataset, and demonstrate that Embed-RUL outperforms the previously reported state-of-the-art (Malhotra, TV, et al., 2016) on several metrics.",2017,2017-09-04 00:00:00,142.0,54.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c49032b2b8052720d271b0996a5f845678b2a0f8

Besides, the calculated plans need to be robust against the process-level disturbances and stochastic nature of some parameters like manual processing times or machine availability. In the paper, a simulation-based optimisation method is proposed that utilises lower level shop floor data to calculate robust production plans for final assembly lines of a flexible, multi-stage production system. In order to minimise the idle times when executing the plans, the capacity control that specifies the proper operator–task assignments is also determined. The analysed multi-stage system is operated with a pull strategy, which means that the production at the final assembly lines generates demands for the preceding stages providing the assembled components. In order to guarantee the feasibility of the plans calculated for the final assembly lines, a decomposition approach is proposed to optimise the production plan of preceding stages. By this way, the robust production can be ensured resulting in reduced losses and overall production costs even though the system is exposed to changes and disturbances.",2017,2017-07-03 00:00:00,41.0,43.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/825b129a0b97205b99500487046ee14b8960c62b

10.1371/journal.pone.0083996,Efficient Modeling and Active Learning Discovery of Biological Responses,"High throughput and high content screening involve determination of the effect of many compounds on a given target. As currently practiced, screening for each new target typically makes little use of information from screens of prior targets. Further, choices of compounds to advance to drug development are made without significant screening against off-target effects. The overall drug development process could be made more effective, as well as less expensive and time consuming, if potential effects of all compounds on all possible targets could be considered, yet the cost of such full experimentation would be prohibitive. In this paper, we describe a potential solution: probabilistic models that can be used to predict results for unmeasured combinations, and active learning algorithms for efficiently selecting which experiments to perform in order to build those models and determining when to stop. Using simulated and experimental data, we show that our approaches can produce powerful predictive models without exhaustive experimentation and can learn them much faster than by selecting experiments at random.",2013,2013-12-17 00:00:00,31.0,29.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3fb28d968aa8083b9159916a74f7a6826feddbb

10.1007/s00146-022-01389-z,Justificatory explanations in machine learning: for increased transparency through documenting how key concepts drive and underpin design and engineering decisions,"Given the pervasiveness of AI systems and their potential negative effects on people’s lives (especially among already marginalised groups), it becomes imperative to comprehend what goes on when an AI system generates a result, and based on what reasons, it is achieved. There are consistent technical efforts for making systems more “explainable” by reducing their opaqueness and increasing their interpretability and explainability. In this paper, we explore an alternative non-technical approach towards explainability that complement existing ones. Leaving aside technical, statistical, or data-related issues, we focus on the very conceptual underpinnings of the design decisions made by developers and other stakeholders during the lifecycle of a machine learning project. For instance, the design and development of an app to track snoring to detect possible health risks presuppose some picture or another of “health”, which is a key notion that conceptually underpins the project. We take it as a premise that these key concepts are necessarily present during design and development, albeit perhaps tacitly. We argue that by providing “justificatory explanations” about how the team understands the relevant key concepts behind its design decisions, interested parties could gain valuable insights and make better sense of the workings and outcomes of systems. Using the concept of “health”, we illustrate how a particular understanding of it might influence decisions during the design and development stages of a machine learning project, and how making this explicit by incorporating it into ex-post explanations might increase the explanatory and justificatory power of these explanations. We posit that a greater conceptual awareness of the key concepts that underpin design and development decisions may be beneficial to any attempt to develop explainability methods. We recommend that “justificatory explanations” are provided as technical documentation. These are declarative statements that contain at its simplest: (1) a high-level account of the understanding of the relevant key concepts a team possess related to a project’s main domain, (2) how these understandings drive decision-making during the life-cycle stages, and (3) it gives reasons (which could be implicit in the account) that the person or persons doing the explanation consider to have plausible justificatory power for the decisions that were made during the project.",2022,2022-03-30 00:00:00,6.0,62.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d463ea45b0f7eb0bea6b713c28ef5b7a308129d3

10.1111/1541-4337.13283,Sources and contamination routes of seafood with human pathogenic Vibrio spp.: A Farm-to-Fork approach.,"Vibrio spp., known human foodborne pathogens, thrive in freshwater, estuaries, and marine settings, causing vibriosis upon ingestion. The rising global vibriosis cases due to climate change necessitate a deeper understanding of Vibrio epidemiology and human transmission. This review delves into Vibrio contamination in seafood, scrutinizing its sources and pathways. We comprehensively assess the contamination of human-pathogenic Vibrio in the seafood chain, covering raw materials to processed products. A ""Farm-to-Fork"" approach, aligned with the One Health concept, is essential for grasping the complex nature of Vibrio contamination. Vibrio's widespread presence in natural and farmed aquatic environments establishes them as potential entry points into the seafood chain. Environmental factors, including climate, human activities, and wildlife, influence contamination sources and routes, underscoring the need to understand the origin and transmission of pathogens in raw seafood. Once within the seafood chain, the formation of protective biofilms on various surfaces in production and processing poses significant food safety risks, necessitating proper cleaning and disinfection to prevent microbial residue. In addition, inadequate seafood handling, from inappropriate processing procedures to cross-contamination via pests or seafood handlers, significantly contributes to Vibrio food contamination, thus warranting attention to reduce risks. Information presented here support the imperative for proactive measures, robust research, and interdisciplinary collaboration in order to effectively mitigate the risks posed by human pathogenic Vibrio contamination, safeguarding public health and global food security. This review serves as a crucial resource for researchers, industrials, and policymakers, equipping them with the knowledge to develop biosecurity measures associated with Vibrio-contaminated seafood.",2023,2023-12-19 00:00:00,20.0,121.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/729050d163a36c7f6fcafeb7678534ab8c348a81

10.3390/microorganisms11112751,Genetic and Phenotypic Virulence Potential of Non-O1/Non-O139 Vibrio cholerae Isolated from German Retail Seafood,"Non-O1 and non-O139 Vibrio cholerae (NOVC) can cause gastrointestinal infections in humans. Contaminated food, especially seafood, is an important source of human infections. In this study, the virulence potential of 63 NOVC strains isolated from retail seafood were characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic levels. Although no strain encoded the cholera toxin (CTX) and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), several virulence factors, including the HlyA hemolysin, the cholix toxin ChxA, the heat-stable enterotoxin Stn, and genes coding for the type 3 and type 6 secretion systems, were detected. All strains showed hemolytic activity against human and sheep erythrocytes: 90% (n = 57) formed a strong biofilm, 52% (n = 33) were highly motile at 37 °C, and only 8% (n = 5) and 14% (n = 9) could resist ≥60% and ≥40% human serum, respectively. Biofilm formation and toxin regulation genes were also detected. cgMLST analysis demonstrated that NOVC strains from seafood cluster with clinical NOVC strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results in the identification of five strains that developed non-wildtype phenotypes (medium and resistant) against the substances of the classes of beta-lactams (including penicillin, carbapenem, and cephalosporin), polymyxins, and sulphonamides. The phenotypic resistance pattern could be partially attributed to the acquired resistance determinants identified via in silico analysis. Our results showed differences in the virulence potential of the analyzed NOVC isolated from retail seafood products, which may be considered for further pathogenicity evaluation and the risk assessment of NOVC isolates in future seafood monitoring.",2023,2023-11-01 00:00:00,4.0,77.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a8b8aa0774d661ac09f584e300b340a84d16287
10.1128/spectrum.01502-23,"The impact of global warming on the signature virulence gene, thermolabile hemolysin, of Vibrio parahaemolyticus","ABSTRACT Global warming is increasing human exposure to pathogens and has already had an impact on human health. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a major pathogen causing foodborne illness, accumulates in numerous aquatic organisms and can be affected by environmental stressors such as increased replication errors or DNA damage resulting in point mutations. This could lead to an elevation in the mutation rate, which influences the expansion of Vibrio spp. habitats and the spread of associated diseases. In this study, a total of 241 strains were isolated from aquatic products imported or exported through China Customs between 2005 and 2010. The whole genomes of those strains were sequenced, revealing a highly significant level of genetic diversity. Our analysis identified 27 new sequence types (STs) ranging from ST2950 to ST2976. The global temperature trend since 1950 affects the thermolabile hemolysin gene (tlh) found in all Vibrio parahaemolyticus leading to mutant sites exhibiting similar trends as temperatures rise; seven high-frequency mutation hotspots (A180G, T552G, G657T, T858C, C1062T, A1137G, and T1179C) were identified along with two clinically specific sites (T259C and A951T) that may indicate adaptation over time due to climate change, leading to increased virulence potential for this bacterial species. These results provide insight into the genetics of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and provide a reference for subsequent research, identification, and monitoring efforts related to its spread. IMPORTANCE In this study, Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains were collected from a large number of aquatic products globally and found that temperature has an impact on the virulence of these bacteria. As global temperatures rise, mutations in a gene marker called thermolabile hemolysin (tlh) also increase. This suggests that environmental isolates adapt to the warming environment and become more pathogenic. The findings can help in developing tools to analyze and monitor these bacteria as well as assess any link between climate change and vibrio-associated diseases, which could be used for forecasting outbreaks associated with them.

Colistin was considered a last-resort antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. Since the reintroduction of colistin, a number of mechanisms of colistin resistance in A. baumannii have been reported, including complete loss of LPS by inactivation of the biosynthetic pathway, modifications of target LPS driven by the addition of phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) moieties to lipid A mediated by the chromosomal pmrCAB operon and eptA gene-encoded enzymes or plasmid-encoded mcr genes and efflux of colistin from the cell. In addition to resistance to colistin, widespread heteroresistance is another feature of A. baumannii that leads to colistin treatment failure. This review aims to present a critical assessment of relevant published (>50 experimental papers) up-to-date knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of colistin resistance in A. baumannii with a detailed review of implicated mutations and the global distribution of colistin-resistant strains.",2023,2023-03-01 00:00:00,63.0,163.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/875121498400082f340228312166931f54719aff

In order to detect the counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers at high redshift, the high-energy observations will play a crucial role. Here, we explore the perspectives of ET, as single observatory and in a network of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, operating in synergy with future γ -ray and X-ray satellites. We predict the high-energy emission of BNS mergers and its detectability in a theoretical framework which is able to reproduce the properties of the current sample of observed short GRBs (SGRB). We estimate the joint GW and high-energy detection rate for both the prompt and afterglow emissions, testing several combinations of instruments and observational strategies. We ﬁnd that the vast majority of SGRBs detected in γ -rays will have a detectable GW counterpart; the joint detection e ﬃ ciency approaches 100% considering a network of third generation GW observatories. The probability of identifying the electromagnetic counterpart of BNS mergers is signiﬁcantly enhanced if the sky localization provided by GW instruments is observed by wide ﬁeld X-ray monitors. We emphasize that the role of the future X-ray observatories will be very crucial for the detection of the fainter emission outside the jet core, which will allow us to probe the yet unexplored population of low-luminosity SGRBs in the nearby Universe, as well as to unveil the nature of the jet structure and the connections with the progenitor properties.",2022,2022-04-04 00:00:00,37.0,7.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4435db18028eaf6fed07525c1611625ad0d3cb8d

The traditional approach of classification requires the calculation of the period of the observed light curve and assigning different variability patterns of phase folded light curves to different classes. However, applying these methods becomes difficult if the light curves are sparse or contain temporal gaps. Also, period finding algorithms start slowing down and become redundant in such scenarios. In this work, we present a new automated method, 1D CNN-LSTM, for classifying variable stars using a hybrid neural network of one-dimensional CNN and LSTM network which employs the raw time-series data from the variable stars. We apply the network to classify the time-series data obtained from the OGLE and the CRTS survey.

The Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) estimates values and uncertainties for a galaxy’s bulge-to-total-light ratio (L B /L T ), effective radius (R e ), and flux (F). To estimate posteriors, GaMPEN uses the Monte Carlo Dropout technique and incorporates the full covariance matrix between the output parameters in its loss function. GaMPEN also uses a spatial transformer network (STN) to automatically crop input galaxy frames to an optimal size before determining their morphology. This will allow it to be applied to new data without prior knowledge of galaxy size. Training and testing GaMPEN on galaxies simulated to match z < 0.25 galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Wide g-band images, we demonstrate that GaMPEN achieves typical errors of 0.1 in L B /L T , 0.″17 (∼7%) in R e , and 6.3 × 104 nJy (∼1%) in F. GaMPEN's predicted uncertainties are well calibrated and accurate (<5% deviation)—for regions of the parameter space with high residuals, GaMPEN correctly predicts correspondingly large uncertainties. We also demonstrate that we can apply categorical labels (i.e., classifications such as highly bulge dominated) to predictions in regions with high residuals and verify that those labels are ≳97% accurate. To the best of our knowledge, GaMPEN is the first machine-learning framework for determining joint posterior distributions of multiple morphological parameters and is also the first application of an STN to optical imaging in astronomy.",2022,2022-07-11 00:00:00,10.0,62.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0df618267b6692aa4803fd86bb4a3c9d7d7c928
10.1093/mnras/stab2142,Galaxy morphological classification catalogue of the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data with convolutional neural networks,"
 We present in this paper one of the largest galaxy morphological classification catalogues to date, including over 20 million galaxies, using the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Monochromatic i-band DES images with linear, logarithmic, and gradient scales, matched with debiased visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo 1 (GZ1) catalogue, are used to train our CNN models. With a training set including bright galaxies (16 ≤ i < 18) at low redshift (z < 0.25), we furthermore investigate the limit of the accuracy of our predictions applied to galaxies at fainter magnitude and at higher redshifts. Our final catalogue covers magnitudes 16 ≤ i < 21, and redshifts z < 1.0, and provides predicted probabilities to two galaxy types – ellipticals and spirals (disc galaxies). Our CNN classifications reveal an accuracy of over 99 per cent for bright galaxies when comparing with the GZ1 classifications (i < 18). For fainter galaxies, the visual classification carried out by three of the co-authors shows that the CNN classifier correctly categorizes discy galaxies with rounder and blurred features, which humans often incorrectly visually classify as ellipticals. As a part of the validation, we carry out one of the largest examinations of non-parametric methods, including ∼100 ,000 galaxies with the same coverage of magnitude and redshift as the training set from our catalogue. We find that the Gini coefficient is the best single parameter discriminator between ellipticals and spirals for this data set.",2021,2021-07-21 00:00:00,26.0,84.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb3f0bdda9fecdab01b4247b87aeefca3b7be74e

10.1093/MNRAS/STAB734,Beyond the hubble sequence – exploring galaxy morphology with unsupervised machine learning,"
 We explore unsupervised machine learning for galaxy morphology analyses using a combination of feature extraction with a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and hierarchical clustering (HC). We propose a new methodology that includes: (1) consideration of the clustering performance simultaneously when learning features from images; (2) allowing for various distance thresholds within the HC algorithm; (3) using the galaxy orientation to determine the number of clusters. This set-up provides 27 clusters created with this unsupervised learning that we show are well separated based on galaxy shape and structure (e.g. Sérsic index, concentration, asymmetry, Gini coefficient). These resulting clusters also correlate well with physical properties such as the colour–magnitude diagram, and span the range of scaling relations such as mass versus size amongst the different machine-defined clusters. When we merge these multiple clusters into two large preliminary clusters to provide a binary classification, an accuracy of $\sim 87{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ is reached using an imbalanced data set, matching real galaxy distributions, which includes 22.7 per cent early-type galaxies and 77.3 per cent late-type galaxies. Comparing the given clusters with classic Hubble types (ellipticals, lenticulars, early spirals, late spirals, and irregulars), we show that there is an intrinsic vagueness in visual classification systems, in particular galaxies with transitional features such as lenticulars and early spirals. Based on this, the main result in this work is not how well our unsupervised method matches visual classifications and physical properties, but that the method provides an independent classification that may be more physically meaningful than any visually based ones.",2020,2020-09-24 00:00:00,28.0,61.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d4918fc568f1f1d035a2dba7e7277331dff1395f

It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.

Much of the literature at this time is dedicated to the conceptualization of digital twins, and associated enabling technologies and challenges. In this paper, we consider these propositions for the specific application of nuclear power. Our review finds that the current DT concepts are amenable to nuclear power systems, but benefit from some modifications and enhancements. Further, some areas of the existing modeling and simulation infrastructure around nuclear power systems are adaptable to DT development, while more recent efforts in advanced modeling and simulation are less suitable at this time. For nuclear power applications, DT development should rely first on mechanistic model-based methods to leverage the extensive experience and understanding of these systems. Model-free techniques can then be adopted to selectively, and correctively, augment limitations in the model-based approaches. Challenges to the realization of a DT are also discussed, with some being unique to nuclear engineering, however most are broader. A challenging aspect we discuss in detail for DTs is the incorporation of uncertainty quantification (UQ). Forward UQ enables the propagation of uncertainty from the digital representations to predict behavior of the physical asset. Similarly, inverse UQ allows for the incorporation of data from new measurements obtained from the physical asset back into the DT. Optimization under uncertainty facilitates decision support through the formal methods of optimal experimental design and design optimization that maximize information gain, or performance, of the physical asset in an uncertain environment.",2021,2021-07-14 00:00:00,58.0,129.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d9711ece38ad060accb833117aec4d3fda6caa6

Decision-support tools are often based on network models, and this article uses information encoded by social networks to solve the problem of employer turnover. However, understanding the factors behind black-box prediction models can be challenging. Our question was about the predictability of employee turnover, given information from the multilayer network that describes collaborations and perceptions that assess the performance of organizations that indicate the success of cooperation. Our goal was to develop an accurate prediction procedure, preserve the interpretability of the classification, and capture the wide variety of specific reasons that explain positive cases. After a feature engineering, we identified variables with the best predictive power using decision trees and ranked them based on their added value considering their frequent co-occurrence. We applied the Random Forest using the SMOTE balancing technique for prediction. We calculated the SHAP values to identify the variables that contribute the most to individual predictions.

To achieve this, existing approaches take advantage of knowledge graphs to learn more evidence for inference. However, they often omit the knowledge that lies in the unstructured data. In this research, we concentrate on inferring complementary and substitutable products in e-commerce from mass structured and unstructured data. An improved knowledge-graph-based reasoning model has been proposed which cannot only derive related products but also provide interpretable paths to explain the relationship. The methodology employed in our study unfolds through several stages. First, a knowledge graph refining entities and relationships from data was constructed. Second, we developed a two-stage knowledge representation learning method to better represent the structured and unstructured knowledge based on TransE and SBERT. Then, the relationship inferring problem was converted into a path reasoning problem under the Markov decision process environment by learning a dynamic policy network. We also applied a soft pruning strategy and a modified reward function to improve the effectiveness of the policy network training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on standard Amazon datasets, and it gives about 5–15% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art models in terms of NDCG@10, Recall@10, Precision @10, and HR@10.",2023,2023-11-20 00:00:00,1.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09497209a996340a2e69f4cc43b45125ef5dacbe

For this purpose, transaction datasets such as credit card transactions and e-commerce purchase histories can be used in recommendation systems to understand underlying user interests by exploiting user-item interactions, which can be a powerful signal to perform this task. This study proposes a link prediction-based recommendation system combining graph representation learning algorithms and gradient boosting classifiers for transaction datasets. The proposed system generates a network where nodes correspond to users and items, and links represent their interactions. A use case scenario is examined on a credit card transaction dataset as a merchant prediction task that predicts the merchants where users can make purchases in the next month. Performances of common network embedding extraction techniques and classifier models are evaluated via various experiments conducted and based on these evaluations, a novel system is proposed, and a matrix factorization-based alternative recommendation method is compared with the proposed model.

10.17762/ijritcc.v11i3.6327,Embedding-based Method for the Supervised Link Prediction in Social Networks,"In recent years, social network analysis has received a lot of interest. Link prediction is an important area of research in this field that uses information from current networks to predict the likely links that will emerge in the future. It has attracted considerable attention from interdisciplinary research communities due to its ubiquitous applications in biological networks, computer science, transportation networks, bioinformatics, telecommunication networks, and so on. Currently, supervised machine learning is one of the critical techniques in the link prediction task. Several algorithms have been developed by many authors to predict the future link in the network, but there is still scope to improve the previous approaches. In the supervised link prediction process, feature selection is a crucial step. Most existing algorithms use one type of similarity-based feature to represent data, which is not well described due to the large scale and heterogeneity of social networks. One of the newest techniques for link prediction is embedding methods, which are used to preparing the feature vector for each the nonexisting links in the network. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to supervised link prediction based on feature embedding methods in order to achieve better performance. Our contribution considers a set of embedding methods as the feature vector for training the machine learning classifiers. The main focus of this work is to investigate the relevance of different feature embedding methods to improve the performance of the supervised link prediction models. The experimental results on some real-world temporal networks revealed satisfactory results, which encourage us for further analysis.

This approach assists farmers to enhance the classification of fruit methods and increase their production. This study proposes simple and effective models using a deep learning approach with You Only Look Once (YOLO) versions. The models were developed through transfer learning where the dataset was trained with 100 images of oil fruit palm and 400 images of a variety of fruit in RGB images. Model performance and accuracy of automatically annotating the images with 3500 fruits were examined. The results show that the annotation technique successfully annotated a large number of images accurately. The mAP result achieved for oil palm fruit was 98.7% and the variety of fruit was 99.5%.",2023,2023-01-04 00:00:00,93.0,48.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70e4d15c7b250bbb090f8f37652d7ac6ba599608

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930803,A New Smart Router-Throttling Method to Mitigate DDoS Attacks,"The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one of the most server threats to the current Internet and brings huge losses to society. Furthermore, it is challenging to defend DDoS due to the case that the DDoS traffic can appear similar to the legitimate ones. Router throttling is an accessible approach to defend DDoS attacks. Some existing router throttling methods dynamically adjust a given threshold value to keep the server load safe. However, these methods are not ideal as they exploit the information of the current time, so the perception of time series variations is poor. The DDoS problem can be seen as a Markov decision process (MDP). Multi-agent router throttling (MART) method based on hierarchical communication mechanism has been proposed to address this problem. However, each agent is independent with each other and has no communication among them, therefore, it is hard for them to collaborate to learn an ideal policy to defend DDoS. To solve this multi-agent partially observable MDP problem, we propose a centralized reinforcement learning router throttling method based on a centralized communication mechanism. Each router sends its own traffic reading to a central router, the central router then makes a decision for each router to choose the throttling rate. We also simulate the environment of the DDoS problem more realistic while modify the reward function of the MART to make the reward function of more coherent. To decrease the communication costs, we add a deep deterministic policy gradient network for each router to decide whether or not to send information to the central agent. The experiments validate that our proposed new smart router throttling method outperforms existing methods to the DDoS instruction response.",2019,,17.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7cd0af32ad8d4efb7b02f4a9fcb69733607d5e2

10.17775/CSEEJPES.2016.00030,Measurement-based frequency dynamic response estimation using geometric template matching and recurrent artificial neural network,"Understanding power system dynamics after an event occurs is essential for the purpose of online stability assessment and control applications. Wide area measurement systems (WAMS) based on synchrophasors make power system dynamics visible to system operators, delivering an accurate picture of overall operating conditions. However, in actual field implementations, some measurements can be inaccessible for various reasons, e.g., most notably communication failure. To reconstruct these inaccessible measurements, in this paper, the radial basis function artificial neural network (RBF-ANN) is used to estimate the system dynamics. In order to find the best input features of the RBF-ANN model, geometric template matching (GeTeM) and quality-threshold (QT) clustering are employed from the time series analysis to compute the similarity of frequency dynamic responses in different locations of the power system. The proposed method is tested and verified on the Eastern Interconnection (EI) transmission system in the United States. The results obtained indicate that the proposed approach provides a compact and efficient RBF-ANN model that accurately estimates the inaccessible frequency dynamic responses under different operating conditions and with fewer inputs.",2016,2016-09-01 00:00:00,11.0,0.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c93f206dbe14f3b6bbb7f69115da5dd269fc522f

10.1101/GR.229202,BLAT--the BLAST-like alignment tool.,"Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.",2002,2002-04-01 00:00:00,8625.0,25.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2878976835c73ed0906e17a7336b9bf10d491a1a

Although EEG is non-invasive direct measurement of brain neural activity and has potentials for various neurologic disorders, vulnerability to noise, difficulty in clinical interpretation and quantification of signal information have limited its clinical application. There have been many research about machine learning (ML) adoption with EEG, but the accuracy of detecting AD is not so high or not validated with Aβ PET scan. We developed EEG-ML algorithm to detect brain Aβ pathology among subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) population, and validated it with Aβ PET. 19-channel resting-state EEG and Aβ PET were collected from 311 subjects: 196 SCD(36 Aβ +, 160 Aβ −), 115 MCI(54 Aβ +, 61Aβ −). 235 EEG data were used for training ML, and 76 for validation. EEG features were standardized for age and sex. Multiple important features sets were selected by 6 statistics analysis. Then, we trained 8 multiple machine learning for each important features set. Meanwhile, we conducted paired t-test to find statistically different features between amyloid positive and negative group. The best model showed 90.9% sensitivity, 76.7% specificity and 82.9% accuracy in MCI + SCD (33 Aβ +, 43 Aβ −). Limited to SCD, 92.3% sensitivity, 75.0% specificity, 81.1% accuracy (13 Aβ +, 24 Aβ −). 90% sensitivity, 78.9% specificity and 84.6% accuracy for MCI (20 Aβ +, 19 Aβ − ) . Similar trends of EEG power have been observed from the group comparison between Aβ + and Aβ −, and between MCI and SCD: enhancement of frontal/ frontotemporal theta; attenuation of mid-beta in centroparietal areas. The present findings suggest that accurate classification for beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain based on QEEG alone could be possible, which implies that QEEG is a promising biomarker for beta-amyloid. Since QEEG is more accessible, cost-effective, and safer than amyloid PET, QEEG-based biomarkers may play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. We expect specific patterns in QEEG could play an important role to predict future progression of cognitive impairment in the preclinical stage of AD.

We report results of time-resolved solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and light scattering experiments on 40-residue amyloid-β (Aβ40) that provide structural information for oligomers that form on time scales from 0.7 ms to 1.0 h after initiation of self-assembly by a rapid pH drop. Low-temperature ssNMR spectra of freeze-trapped intermediates indicate that β-strand conformations within and contacts between the two main hydrophobic segments of Aβ40 develop within 1 ms, while light scattering data imply a primarily monomeric state up to 5 ms. Intermolecular contacts involving residues 18 and 33 develop within 0.5 s, at which time Aβ40 is approximately octameric. These contacts argue against β-sheet organizations resembling those found previously in protofibrils and fibrils.

10.1038/s41467-023-38204-2,Structural analysis and architectural principles of the bacterial amyloid curli,"Two decades have passed since the initial proposition that amyloids are not only (toxic) byproducts of an unintended aggregation cascade, but that they can also be produced by an organism to serve a defined biological function. That revolutionary idea was borne out of the realization that a large fraction of the extracellular matrix that holds Gram-negative cells into a persistent biofilm is composed of protein fibers (curli; tafi) with cross-β architecture, nucleation-dependent polymerization kinetics and classic amyloid tinctorial properties. The list of proteins shown to form so-called functional amyloid fibers in vivo has greatly expanded over the years, but detailed structural insights have not followed at a similar pace in part due to the associated experimental barriers. Here we combine extensive AlphaFold2 modelling and cryo-electron transmission microscopy to propose an atomic model of curli protofibrils, and their higher modes of organization. We uncover an unexpected structural diversity of curli building blocks and fibril architectures. Our results allow for a rationalization of the extreme physico-chemical robustness of curli, as well as earlier observations of inter-species curli promiscuity, and should facilitate further engineering efforts to expand the repertoire of curli-based functional materials.",2023,2023-05-17 00:00:00,25.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35b04ae59fc00fc6007e0f982b7f956736d72c56

10.1038/s41598-023-31730-5,Genetic correlations between Alzheimer’s disease and gut microbiome genera,"A growing body of evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the human gut microbiota is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) via neuroinflammatory processes across the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota affects brain health through the secretion of toxins and short-chain fatty acids, which modulates gut permeability and numerous immune functions. Observational studies indicate that AD patients have reduced microbiome diversity, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Uncovering the genetic basis of microbial abundance and its effect on AD could suggest lifestyle changes that may reduce an individual’s risk for the disease. Using the largest genome-wide association study of gut microbiota genera from the MiBioGen consortium, we used polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses with the “best-fit” model implemented in PRSice-2 and determined the genetic correlation between 119 genera and AD in a discovery sample (ADc12 case/control: 1278/1293). To confirm the results from the discovery sample, we next repeated the PRS analysis in a replication sample (GenADA case/control: 799/778) and then performed a meta-analysis with the PRS results from both samples. Finally, we conducted a linear regression analysis to assess the correlation between the PRSs for the significant genera and the APOE genotypes. In the discovery sample, 20 gut microbiota genera were initially identified as genetically associated with AD case/control status. Of these 20, three genera ( Eubacterium fissicatena as a protective factor , Collinsella, and Veillonella as a risk factor) were independently significant in the replication sample. Meta-analysis with discovery and replication samples confirmed that ten genera had a significant correlation with AD, four of which were significantly associated with the APOE rs429358 risk allele in a direction consistent with their protective/risk designation in AD association. Notably, the proinflammatory genus Collinsella, identified as a risk factor for AD, was positively correlated with the APOE rs429358 risk allele in both samples. Overall, the host genetic factors influencing the abundance of ten genera are significantly associated with AD, suggesting that these genera may serve as biomarkers and targets for AD treatment and intervention. Our results highlight that proinflammatory gut microbiota might promote AD development through interaction with APOE . Larger datasets and functional studies are required to understand their causal relationships.",2023,2023-03-31 00:00:00,76.0,88.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2056364860ec61295bb6cebcd244d703ff1c41c7

However, it has not been fully determined which lipids are involved in the initiation of αSyn aggregation in PD. Here exploiting genetic understanding associating the loss-of-function mutation in Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1), a phosphoinositide phosphatase, with familial PD and analysis of postmortem PD brains, we identified a novel lipid molecule involved in the toxic conversion of αSyn and its relation to PD. We first established a SYNJ1 knockout cell model and found SYNJ1 depletion increases the accumulation of pathological αSyn. Lipidomic analysis revealed SYNJ1 depletion elevates the level of its substrate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP_3). We then employed Caenorhabditis elegans model to examine the effect of SYNJ1 defect on the neurotoxicity of αSyn. Mutations in SYNJ1 accelerated the accumulation of αSyn aggregation and induced locomotory defects in the nematodes. These results indicate that functional loss of SYNJ1 promotes the pathological aggregation of αSyn via the dysregulation of its substrate PIP_3, leading to the aggravation of αSyn-mediated neurodegeneration. Treatment of cultured cell line and primary neurons with PIP_3 itself or with PIP_3 phosphatase inhibitor resulted in intracellular formation of αSyn inclusions. Indeed, in vitro protein–lipid overlay assay validated that phosphoinositides, especially PIP_3, strongly interact with αSyn. Furthermore, the aggregation assay revealed that PIP_3 not only accelerates the fibrillation of αSyn, but also induces the formation of fibrils sharing conformational and biochemical characteristics similar to the fibrils amplified from the brains of PD patients. Notably, the immunohistochemical and lipidomic analyses on postmortem brain of patients with sporadic PD showed increased PIP_3 level and its colocalization with αSyn. Taken together, PIP_3 dysregulation promotes the pathological aggregation of αSyn and increases the risk of developing PD, and PIP_3 represents a potent target for intervention in PD.",2023,2023-03-20 00:00:00,13.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39e8406ffa34930abc1cb10eb7d5c9756539e3e8

10.1073/pnas.2214921120,Exploiting the intrinsic misfolding propensity of the KRAS oncoprotein,"Significance Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) remains a difficult-to-drug oncogene due to its shallow surface, lacking binding grooves for small molecule compounds. We circumvent this problem by targeting aggregation-prone sequence segments (APRs) of KRAS with synthetic amyloid peptides, termed Pept-ins, that induce KRAS misfolding and aggregation. Oncogenic mutations at positions 12 and 13 amplify the aggregation propensity of an APR. A Pept-in encoding the G12V-amplified APR induces the aggregation of KRAS in vitro and in cells. We also find that this Pept-in inhibits pAkt signaling in endogeneous G12V cancer lines and suppresses tumor growth after subcutaneous injection in a syngenic G12V mouse model. The possibility to target primary sequence segments to inactivate proteins by misfolding opens opportunities for difficult-to-drug proteins such as KRAS.",2023,2023-02-22 00:00:00,7.0,2.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6bdcce6171aca2afa3d8760ca9266a5246f1c140
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905847,Factorization-Based Active Contour for Water-Land SAR Image Segmentation via the Fusion of Features,"The segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) water-land images is a very difficult task not only because of strong multiplicative noise but also due to the blurred boundary, irregular shape, and together with diminished contrast. In this paper, we propose a matrix factorization active contour model based on fused features for SAR image segmentation. First, to enhance the robustness, multiple features are utilized. For each pixel location, feature maps (matrix) are constructed by combining wavelet textual features, Gaussian (DoG) filter features, and Gabor filter features via local spectral histogram, which improves spatial pattern and express image structure. Second, the energy function is constructed based on region information and edge information of SAR image. Region information is obtained via matrix factorization theory on the feature matrix. Edge information is obtained by modified the ratio of exponentially weighted averages operator. Then, a convex energy function is proposed to avoid the local minima. A fast dual formulation is introduced for the evolution of the contour. Finally, synthetic and real SAR data are used for verification. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm is effective for water/land segmentation in SAR images.",2019,2019-03-18 00:00:00,21.0,39.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81c3e95114512be6283705c568d6fddf00a3f9b2

An attempt has been made to delineate the groundwater potential zones of Puruliya district using the integrated RS-GIS and AHP techniques. All the themes and their features have been assigned weights according to their relative importance and their normalized weights were calculated after the hierarchical ranking by pair-wise comparison matrix of analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Groundwater potential map has been prepared through weighted overlay model in GIS environment after integrating all the thematic layers. The entire district has been classified into three different groundwater potential zones—high, moderate, and low. Greater portion of the study area (60.92%) fall within the moderate potentiality zone, about 22.55% and 16.53% of the total area fall under the high and low potential zone, respectively. Potential zones have been validated with the groundwater yield data, 10 out of 14 validation points (71.43%), matches with the expected yield classes. It shows that the applied method produces significantly reliable results for the present study which can help the decision makers to formulate an effective plan for the study area.",2018,2018-12-09 00:00:00,196.0,46.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50f3dbdbb6773620659e848d6f904358e938a072

10.3390/rs10010027,"Remote Sensing of Hydrological Changes in Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Lake, an Ungauged Area of the Yangtze River Basin","The hydrological pattern changes have a great influence on the wetland environment. However, some important wetland areas often lack historical observations due to economic and physical conditions. The Tian-e-Zhou oxbow lake wetland is an important habitat for two endangered species and also has very little historical hydrological data. Remote sensing images can be used to explore the historical water area fluctuation of lakes. In addition, remote sensing can also be used to obtain historical water levels based on the water boundary elevation integrated with a topographic data (WBET) method or the level-surface area relationship curve (LRC) method. In order to minimize the uncertainty of the derived results, both methods were introduced in the extraction of the water level of Tian-e-Zhou during 1992–2015. The results reveal that the hydrological regime of the oxbow lake has experienced a significant change after the Shatanzi Levee construction in 1998. With the impact of the levee, the mean annual water surface area of the lake was reduced by 5.8 km2 during the flood season, but, during the non-flood season, it was increased by 1.35 km2. For the same period, the water level of the lake during the flood season also showed a 1.47 m (WBET method) or 3.21 m (LRC method) decrease. The mean annual water level increased by 1.12 m (WBET method) or 0.75 m (LRC method). Both results had a good accuracy with RMSE (root-mean-square errors) of less than 0.4 m. Furthermore, the water level differences between the Yangtze River channel and the oxbow lake increased by at least 0.5 m. It is found that the hydrological pattern of the oxbow lake changed significantly after the levee construction, which could bring some disadvantages to the habitats of the two endangered species.",2017,2017-12-25 00:00:00,19.0,44.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6188579b141d6d5078ce8e85f335f6d6c1852f78

10.3390/RS9101013,A Spectral Unmixing Method with Ensemble Estimation of Endmembers: Application to Flood Mapping in the Caprivi Floodplain,"The Caprivi basin in Namibia has been affected by severe flooding in recent years resulting in deaths, displacements and destruction of infrastructure. The negative consequences of these floods have emphasized the need for timely, accurate and objective information about the extent and location of affected areas. Due to the high temporal variability of flood events, Earth Observation (EO) data at high revisit frequency is preferred for accurate flood monitoring. Currently, EO data has either high temporal or coarse spatial resolution. Accurate methodologies for the estimation and monitoring of flooding extent using coarse spatial resolution optical image data are needed in order to capture spatial details in heterogeneous areas such as Caprivi. The objective of this work was the retrieval of the fractional abundance of water ( γ w ) by applying a new spectral indices-based unmixing algorithm to Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Full Resolution (MERIS FR) data using a minimum number of spectral bands. These images are technically similar to the OLCI image data acquired by the Sentinel-3 satellite, which are to be systematically provided in the near future. The normalized difference wetness index (NDWI) was applied to delineate the water surface and combined with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to account for emergent vegetation within the water bodies. The challenge to map flooded areas by applying spectral unmixing is the estimation of spectral endmembers, i.e., pure spectra of land cover features. In our study, we developed and applied a new unmixing method based on the use of an ensemble of spectral endmembers to capture and take into account spectral variability within each endmember. In our case study, forty realizations of the spectral endmembers gave a stable frequency distribution of γ w . Quality of the flood map derived from the Envisat MERIS (MERIS) data was assessed against high (30 m) spatial resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images on two different dates (17 April 2008 and 22 May 2009) during which floods occurred. The findings show that both the spatial and the frequency distribution of the γ w extracted from the MERIS data were in good agreement with the high-resolution TM retrievals. The use of conventional linear unmixing, instead, applied using the entire available spectra for each image, resulted in relatively large differences between TM and MERIS retrievals.",2017,2017-09-30 00:00:00,32.0,56.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/051352820b89e3c194b6ffccce156b89466c530c

Due to population growth and increasing need of human to water, proper management of water resources will be one of the serious challenges of next decades. Remote sensing data is the best way to the management of water resources due time and cost effectiveness over a greater range of temporal and spatial scales. Between many kinds of satellite data, from SAR to optic or from high resolution to low resolution, Landsat imagery is more interesting data for water detection and management of earth surface water. Landsat8 OLI/TIRS is the newest version of Landsat satellite series. In this paper, we investigated the full spectral potential of Landsat8 for water detection. It is developed many kinds of methods for this purpose that index based methods have some advantages than other methods. Pervious indices just use a limited number of spectral band.

10.1093/jas/skz092,"ASN-ASAS SYMPOSIUM: FUTURE OF DATA ANALYTICS IN NUTRITION: Mathematical modeling in ruminant nutrition: approaches and paradigms, extant models, and thoughts for upcoming predictive analytics,","Abstract This paper outlines typical terminology for modeling and highlights key historical and forthcoming aspects of mathematical modeling. Mathematical models (MM) are mental conceptualizations, enclosed in a virtual domain, whose purpose is to translate real-life situations into mathematical formulations to describe existing patterns or forecast future behaviors in real-life situations. The appropriateness of the virtual representation of real-life situations through MM depends on the modeler’s ability to synthesize essential concepts and associate their interrelationships with measured data. The development of MM paralleled the evolution of digital computing. The scientific community has only slightly accepted and used MM, in part because scientists are trained in experimental research and not systems thinking. The scientific advancements in ruminant production have been tangible but incipient because we are still learning how to connect experimental research data and concepts through MM, a process that is still obscure to many scientists. Our inability to ask the right questions and to define the boundaries of our problem when developing models might have limited the breadth and depth of MM in agriculture. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed in tandem with the need to analyze big data using high-performance computing. However, the emergence of AI, a computational technology that is data-intensive and requires less systems thinking of how things are interrelated, may further reduce the interest in mechanistic, conceptual MM. Artificial intelligence might provide, however, a paradigm shift in MM, including nutrition modeling, by creating novel opportunities to understand the underlying mechanisms when integrating large amounts of quantifiable data. Associating AI with mechanistic models may eventually lead to the development of hybrid mechanistic machine-learning modeling. Modelers must learn how to integrate powerful data-driven tools and knowledge-driven approaches into functional models that are sustainable and resilient. The successful future of MM might rely on the development of redesigned models that can integrate existing technological advancements in data analytics to take advantage of accumulated scientific knowledge. However, the next evolution may require the creation of novel technologies for data gathering and analyses and the rethinking of innovative MM concepts rather than spending resources in collecting futile data or amending old technologies.",2019,2019-04-29 00:00:00,55.0,238.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e096c82088093cdc3acfe3bb6a0b2abd79fb703
10.1093/af/vfz006,Precision pig feeding: a breakthrough toward sustainability,"Swine production systems have dramatically changed in the last three decades. Today main challenges for the hog industry are to maximize feed efficiency while minimizing production costs and environmental impacts. With regard to environmental impacts, the issue lies mainly with nitrogen and phosphorus excretion which are reaching alarmingly high levels in most intensive pig production areas (Strid Eriksson et al., 2005; Garcia-Launay et al., 2014). The high relevance of environmental load has forced swine producers and nutritionists around the world to reassess the nutritional and feeding programs in use. Excretion of nutrients can be reduced by providing an individual animal with its required dietary levels. This practice also improves nutrient efficiency and reduces production costs (Pomar et al., 2015; Andretta et al., 2016). Conventionally, factorial methods (NRC, 2012) are used to estimate nutrient requirements for pigs fed in large groups that receive the same feed for extended periods throughout their production cycle. In growing-finishing pigs, for example, their appetite increases faster than nutrient requirements and therefore, the optimal concentration of nutrients in the diet decreases as the pig gets older. These pigs are often fed with three feeds in three distinct feeding phases. The number of feeding phases can be increased to avoid oversupplying pigs with nutrients. Preferably, diets should be adjusted daily to account for the nutritional requirements of pigs more accurately, and therefore improve the efficiency of nutrient utilization. However, increasing the number of diets complicates feed management and increases production costs. Precision livestock farming is an innovative production system approach that can be defined as the management of livestock using the principles and technologies of process engineering (Wathes et al., 2008). Precision animal nutrition or precision feeding is part of the precision livestock farming approach and involves the use of feeding techniques that allow the proper amount of feed with the suitable composition to be supplied in a timely manner to a group of animals (Parsons et al., 2007; Cangar et al., 2008; Pomar et al., 2014) or to individual animals (Andretta et al., 2014; Andretta et al., 2016) to enhance farm profitability, efficiency, and sustainability (Hauschild et al., 2012; Pomar and Pomar, 2012; Pomar et al., 2017). In this production system, the interanimal variability is taken into account by feeding pigs with diets tailored daily to their individual requirements (Pomar et al., 2009; Hauschild et al., 2012; Andretta et al., 2014). The practical application of precision feeding, especially individual precision feeding, can have great impact on livestock sustainability. Precision feeding is a promising feeding technique to reduce the environmental footprint of pig production systems (Gerber et al., 2013). Precision feeding offers immediate and tangible benefits to the pork producer given that feeding pigs individually with daily tailored diets reduces lysine intake by more than 25%, feeding costs by more than 8%, nitrogen and phosphorus excretion by nearly 40% (Andretta et al., 2014; Andretta et al., 2016), and greenhouse gases emission by 6% (Andretta et al., 2018). Still, the actual on-farm application of precision feeding requires better understanding Implications",2019,2019-03-30 00:00:00,78.0,41.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/538d55c0ee7b6d206980e59e9cfd4657e327153c
10.1073/pnas.1802973116,Predictability of human differential gene expression,"Significance The identification of genes that are differentially expressed provides a molecular foothold onto biological questions of interest. Whether some genes are more likely to be differentially expressed than others, and to what degree, has never been assessed on a global scale. Here, we reanalyze more than 600 studies and find that knowledge of a gene’s prior probability of differential expression (DE) allows for accurate prediction of DE hit lists, regardless of the biological question. This result suggests redundancy in transcriptomics experiments that both informs gene set interpretation and highlights room for growth within the field. Differential expression (DE) is commonly used to explore molecular mechanisms of biological conditions. While many studies report significant results between their groups of interest, the degree to which results are specific to the question at hand is not generally assessed, potentially leading to inaccurate interpretation. This could be particularly problematic for metaanalysis where replicability across datasets is taken as strong evidence for the existence of a specific, biologically relevant signal, but which instead may arise from recurrence of generic processes. To address this, we developed an approach to predict DE based on an analysis of over 600 studies. A predictor based on empirical prior probability of DE performs very well at this task (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, ∼0.8), indicating that a large fraction of DE hit lists are nonspecific. In contrast, predictors based on attributes such as gene function, mutation rates, or network features perform poorly. Genes associated with sex, the extracellular matrix, the immune system, and stress responses are prominent within the “DE prior.” In a series of control studies, we show that these patterns reflect shared biology rather than technical artifacts or ascertainment biases. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the DE prior to data interpretation in three use cases: (i) breast cancer subtyping, (ii) single-cell genomics of pancreatic islet cells, and (iii) metaanalysis of lung adenocarcinoma and renal transplant rejection transcriptomics. In all cases, we find hallmarks of generic DE, highlighting the need for nuanced interpretation of gene phenotypic associations.",2019,2019-03-07 00:00:00,99.0,93.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53eb720bbef3b5f703e4e7069fd52daff332a95a

10.3389/fvets.2018.00263,Detecting and Predicting Emerging Disease in Poultry With the Implementation of New Technologies and Big Data: A Focus on Avian Influenza Virus,"Future demands for food will place agricultural systems under pressure to increase production. Poultry is accepted as a good source of protein and the poultry industry will be forced to intensify production in many countries, leading to greater numbers of farms that house birds at elevated densities. Increasing farmed poultry can facilitate enhanced transmission of infectious pathogens among birds, such as avian influenza virus among others, which have the potential to induce widespread mortality in poultry and cause considerable economic losses. Additionally, the capability of some emerging poultry pathogens to cause zoonotic human infection will be increased as greater numbers of poultry operations could increase human contact with poultry pathogens. In order to combat the increased risk of spread of infectious disease in poultry due to intensified systems of production, rapid detection and diagnosis is paramount. In this review, multiple technologies that can facilitate accurate and rapid detection and diagnosis of poultry diseases are highlighted from the literature, with a focus on technologies developed specifically for avian influenza virus diagnosis. Rapid detection and diagnostic technologies allow for responses to be made sooner when disease is detected, decreasing further bird transmission and associated costs. Additionally, systems of rapid disease detection produce data that can be utilized in decision support systems that can predict when and where disease is likely to emerge in poultry. Other sources of data can be included in predictive models, and in this review two highly relevant sources, internet based-data and environmental data, are discussed. Additionally, big data and big data analytics, which will be required in order to integrate voluminous and variable data into predictive models that function in near real-time are also highlighted. Implementing new technologies in the commercial setting will be faced with many challenges, as will designing and operating predictive models for poultry disease emergence. The associated challenges are summarized in this review. Intensified systems of poultry production will require new technologies for detection and diagnosis of infectious disease.
